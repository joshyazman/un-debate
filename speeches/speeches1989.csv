"1",19,"AFG",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me pleasure at the very outset to convey to Major-General Garba my sincere congratulations on his election to the prestigious position of President of this world body at its forty-fourth session. His election is a tribute both to his country  Nigeria  which has demonstrated its unflinching loyalty to the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter  and to his own vast ability  skill and experience.Let me also pay a tribute to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  for his outstanding record at the helm of the General Assembly at its forty-third session.I should like also to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his relentless efforts to enhance the role of the Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security and the solution of global problems. We urge that his role in finding peaceful  comprehensive solutions to regional problems receive full support from the Security Council and the General Assembly. Today's world  fortunately  is marked by a general relaxation of tension in international relations and improved prospects for finding peaceful and lasting solutions to global and regional problems. New vistas of co-operation or. the multilateral  regional and bilateral levels have been opened  facilitating the solution of common-security  political  economic and environmental problems that have plagued our world. Mutual relations between the United States and the Soviet Union are improving  and confrontation between the two has eased considerably. Progress has been made also in negotiations on the reduction or elimination of various types of nuclear  chemical and conventional weapons  while the destruction of at least one category of nuclear weapons is already under way.The need for speedy solution of regional problems has been universally acknowledged  although the process of achieving this has been painfully slow. Peoples in various parts of the world  including our own region  are still the victims of senseless wars and destruction because old policies based on confrontation have not been abandoned in the interest of regional peace and harmony.In the Middle East  we condemn the continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab lands  including Jerusalem and the Syrian Golan Heights  and Israel's iron-fist policy against the heroic Palestinian intifadah. The convening of an international conference with the full participation of all parties concerned  including the State of Palestine  on an equal footing  remains the only possible avenue for resolving the Middle East conflict.The Republic of Afghanistan welcomes the cessation of war and the commencement of talks between Iran and Iraq. We sincerely hope they will find an honourable and lasting solution to all their differences in the near future. In Cyprus  we welcome meetings between the President and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community  and we support a peaceful solution achieved through dialogue and based on the independence  territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Cyprus.We welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea and demand that an end be put to all forms of interference in the internal affairs of Kampuchea. All efforts should be made to restore peace in the country and to let Kampucheans themselves solve their internal difficulties.We also support the Korean people's quest for peaceful reunification and national unity through dialogue and reconciliation.In southern Africa  the continuation of the abhorrent policy of apartheid is the source of great human suffering  destabilization and conflict. We demand the full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and believe the Secretary-General and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group should be rendered full support so they may supervise a free  democratic and unhindered election and the achievement of full independence for Namibia. We welcome the high-level meeting between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front  and support the efforts of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity towards the holding of a fair referendum without administrative or military constraints.We support the accord reached among five Central American countries on putting an end to war and destruction in Nicaragua and hope for its unhindered implementation.It is also our hope that the question of the Malvinas may be promptly resolved on the basis of General Assembly resolutions  eliminating the differences between Argentina and the United Kingdom.The disparities in economic development between developed and developing countries is deepening constantly  while the economic and social situation in most developing countries continues to deteriorate further. The plight of the least developed countries has reached a particularly distressing level because the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries has not been implemented. Growth and development in developing countries continue to be mostly stagnant or to register negative rates. Commodity prices remain low and terms of trade are worsening  and protectionist measures on the part of developed countries have been on the increase. The problem of debt and debt servicing has become unbearable for developing countries  resulting in a net flow of financial resources from developing to developed countries. We welcome the convening in April 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly and hope the fourth United Nations Development Decade will reverse the adverse trends experienced during the Third Decade.It is also our earnest hope that the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  scheduled for 1990 in Paris  will adopt adequate measures for implementing General Assembly resolutions on acceleration of the development process in the least developed countries in the 1990s. Despite our sincere wishes and concerted efforts  and contrary to the general trend of improvement in the international climate  the situation in our region remains far from satisfactory. If anything  it has deteriorated further. Aggression against Afghanistan and interference and intervention in its internal affairs have acquired new dimensions. The complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and our sincere compliance with the provisions of the Geneva Agreements notwithstanding  these Agreements have been sabotaged by Pakistan. Prom 15 February to the end of August 1989  18 different types of weapons have been put in the hands of extremist groups trained in Pakistan to continue the blood-bath in Afghanistan. These weapons include 250 ground-to-ground rocket launchers  110 pieces of field artillery and mortars  120 recoilless artillery  550 air-defence missile complexes  2 950 heavy machine-guns  4 500 manual rocket launchers and 200 000 different types of ground-to-ground rockets.The number of military training centres for the extremists in Pakistan has now reached 180  marking an increase after the entry into force of the Geneva Agreements. Each week between 30 and 35 armed groups  comprising 1 200 to 1 500 people trained in these centres  are infiltrated into Afghanistan to bring death and destruction. Units from Pakistan's 11th Division are directly participating in the fighting inside Afghanistan. So do mercenary Wahabis from Saudi Arabia  which is also putting generous financial assistance in the hands of the extremists. Similarly  from 15 February to the end of August 1989  a total of 413 102 rockets and heavy artillery shells have rained down on the inhabitants of the cities of Afghanistan. What has been the result? Thousands of civilians killed and thousands more injured. In Kabul alone  1 383 rockets have claimed the lives of 671 people and injured another 1 014. Recently even the aeroplane used by the representative of the Secretary-General was not spared such rocket attacks. As recently as 22 and 23 September  a total of 40 rockets were fired on Kabul - on theewe of the General Assembly - killing 41 people and injuring 59. One of the rockets hit a crowded market-place. This is blind terrorism perpetuated by the interventionist policy of one of the signatories to the Geneva Agreements.The resort to rocket attacks on cities and the blind and indiscriminate terrorist attacks against civilians testify not to the strength of the extremists but to their weakness. It is the result of crushing defeats of these groups in Jalalabad  Khost  Kandahar and elsewhere in Afghanistan. The heroic armed forces of Afghanistan defending the independence  territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the country  as is their patriotic duty  have dealt these hirelings of the aliens so crushing a blow that they do not dare any more  even with the direct assistance and participation of the Pakistani army  to face the defenders of Afghanistan. The result has been desperate rocket attacks on cities and the indiscriminate murder of innocent men  women and children. These attacks cannot  however  compensate for the moral  political and military bankruptcy of the extremist groups  nor can they revive in the rank and file of the opposition the lost hope of a military victory. Many commanders inside the country have by now realized the need for ending this fratricidal war and restoring peace through national reconciliation.What Pakistan is continuing against Afghanistan is State terrorism  which has been condemned by the Assembly as well as by the Non-Aligned Movement in a resolution adopted at the Belgrade summit meeting.If internal problems in a neighbouring country should be taken to constitute a basis for policy towards that neighbour  who can predict what could happen to Pakistan and what its future would be? The Punjabis  Sindis  Pashtoons and Baluchis are all tired of the increasing domination of the Pakistani military. However  these are Pakistani problems and we  as neighbours  do not arrogate to ourselves the right to get involved in them. Nor do we believe in creating Governments for others outside their country.The hope for military victory which was crushed at Jalalabad has been further lest during what was termed the sunnier fighting season. No new deadline of 12 or 18 months will accomplish through military means what was supposed to happen weeks or even days after 15 February of this year but did not.But the question is; How many more Afghans have to go down the drain of a senseless fratricidal war for the planners and executors of the war to realize the futility of the military option? How much more must Afghanistan  a least developed country  be destroyed before a military solution is abandoned in favour of a political solution?The time to bring peace to Afghanistan is now. Every day that passes claims the lives of more of its people and brings more havoc to its economy. The grounds for peace  for reconciliation  for the establishment of a broad-based government exist in Afghanistan. What is required is the abandonment of old policies  of intransigent positions and of disregard for reality.The path to arrive at peace in Afghanistan is clear. Full and faithful implementation of the Geneva Agreements by the parties and guarantors and the implementation of consensus resolutions of the General Assembly are the most important and basic steps in that direction. Putting an immediate end to interference and intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  as clearly stipulated by the Agreements  can and must play a cardinal role in realizing peace. Pakistan's sincere co-operation with the United Nations good Offices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNQ3MAP) can turn it from its present ineffectiveness into one that fully supervises the implementation of all the provisions of the Geneva Agreements. So far  the Government of Afghanistan has brought to the notice of UNGOMAP 6 492 cases of flagrant violations of the Geneva Agreements through 827 notes delivered to its headquarters in Kabul. These cases cover violations of every single provision of the Geneva document on non-interference and non-intervention  such as  among other things  the dismantling of bases  refraining from the dispatch of armed groups and the transfer of arms and not committing acts that would undermine the stability of the other high contracting party. None of these violations has been investigated exactly as stipulated in the Geneva Agreements  owing to Pakistan's complete disregard for the accords. The continuation of war  destruction  great human suffering and loss of life in my country is a telling testimony to the complete neglect of all the provisions of the Geneva Agreements by Pakistan. When the flames of war  aggression and intervention are still increasingly swallowing up lives and properties of the people of Afghanistan  any claim that the Geneva Agreements' provisions on non-interference and non-intervention are being implemented can obviously not be taken seriously.The people of Afghanistan and the international community are beginning to question the sincerity and good will of Pakistan in signing the Geneva agreements  as well as the actual observance and supervision of their implementation. The statement made at the opening of the general debate by the President of the United States of America  Mr. George Bush  and his words on the need to work together in the framework of the United Nations to bring peace to those who have fallen victim to regional conflicts are encouraging. A positive change in United States policy  from putting the means of war and destruction in the hands of extremists to assisting and contributing to the peace process in Afghanistan  would play a significant role in putting those words into effect.War cannot accomplish any policy goals and the so-called interim government  illegally established by Islamabad  cannot gain even a grain of legitimacy. The situation has already disintegrated into infighting and armed clashes inside Afghanistan. The policy of supplying them with huge quantities of advanced weapons cannot serve the United States interest in the region  while in the long run the continuation of war  destruction and human suffering in Afghanistan will further damage its standing among the Afghan people. Peaceful ways of arriving at policy objectives are certainly there and must be sought.The situation in Afghanistan has changed since 15 February 1989. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has abandoned the monopoly on power. Therefore  the continuation of previous policies by the United States Administration is not realistic. This has been reflected in the United States mass media and also in the United States Congress. We are ready to welcome in Kabul a special envoy of the United States Administration for a fact-finding mission and an exchange of views. We believe that such a trip would allow the United States to get first-hand knowledge of the present reality in Afghan society and of our goodwill in regard to restoring peace and for a democratic system based on political pluralism and a free economy.As is the case in most other parts of the world  in our region too the traffic in arms and narcotics go hand in hand. The involvement of Afghan extremist groups in the production and smuggling of drugs during the past 10 years has brought about a very dangerous situation. The Republic of Afghanistan stands ready fully to co-operate in eradicating this serious problem.We welcome the positive and realistic trends in the policy of our neighbour to the west  the Islamic Republic of Iran. From the great country of China  another neighbour of Afghanistan  we expect a more positive contribution to the restoration of peace in our country. We  on our part  are ready to have normal  friendly relations with all the countries of the world  particularly our neighbours.The question of the safe  voluntary and honourable return of Afghan refugees requires urgent attention. Those who perpetuate the war in Afghanistan must not cite the continuation of the war as a pretext for their policy of hindering the return of the refugees. While we express our gratitude to all these countries  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other organizations and agencies for having provided for our Afghan brothers while they were refugees  we believe the time has come for such assistance to be geared towards their repatriation to their homeland and reintegration in the life of their country. We urge Pakistan to co-operate in the establishment of mixed commissions. The establishment of these commissions  which according to the Geneva Agreements should have occurred immediately after the entry into force of the Agreements 16 months ago  is long overdue.The reconstruction of Afghanistan requires urgent international  governmental and nonâ1governmental assistance. Unfortunately  3wever  a number of countries have refrained from putting at the disposal of the United Nations Coordinator for Economic and Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan the assistance they have already pledged. Assistance to the people of Afghanistan should not fall victim to political considerations.As regards the internal aspect of the difficulties of Afghanistan  our stand has been set forth on several occasions  most recently by the President of the Republic  Mr. Najibullah  in his address to the Ninth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade. Allow me to reiterate briefly the main contents of the position of the Republic of Afghanistan.We believe that dialogue should start among all Afghan political forces inside and outside Afghanistan aimed at holding a nation-wide peace conference with the participation of all forces concerned. The conference should agree on a leadership council and declare a six-month-long cease-fire. During that period the leadership council should establish a broad-based coalition government and create a commission to draft a new Constitution and the law on general elections for its approval. Following the adoption of the new Constitution and the law on elections by a traditional Loya Jirgah called by the leadership council  general elections through direct  secret ballot should be held. A new government formed by one or more political parties enjoying a majority shall govern the country in accordance with the new Constitution. We stand ready for the supervision of the general elections by an international commission.The Republic of Afghanistan believes that a peaceful political solution must be comprehensive and just  and one in which all political forces must participate. Leaving any political force  including the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan out of the coalition  not only will not solve the problem but will create serious obstacles. The level of participation in the State structure should be subject to negotiation  but participation itself should not. Peace in Afghanistan must come through rational concessions accepted by all. These concessions should be aimed at eradicating all the grounds for conflict and war and not at sowing the seeds of yet another war.It is an open secret that a great number of commanders have boycotted the leadership of organizations based in Pakistan  realizing their servitude to the enemies of our homeland. A number of commanders have opened talks with the State and they are observing cease-fires in areas under their control. Contacts with others are continuing and  sooner rather than later  cast negative feelings and mistrust will give way to friendship  brotherhood and unity.The leadership of the Republic of Afghanistan has faith in armed opposition commanders because it is they who will bring the blessings of life and tranquillity to the people in the areas under their control. Similarly  the leadership of the Republic of Afghanistan will continue its policy of national reconciliation despite the irrational position adopted at present by the leaders of extremist organizations based in Pakistan. For us  the national interests of Afghanistan and the restoration of peace in our country are above any group  tribal  ethnic  political  party or ideological interests.The external aspects of the situation around Afghanistan could best be resolved by convening an international conference with the participation of Afghanistan  Pakistan  Iran  India  China  the United States  the Soviet Union and the Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The conference  which at the outset would agree on putting an end to the delivery of weapons to all factions in Afghanistan  should guarantee Afghanistan's permanently neutral and demilitarised status  which would be enshrined in the new Constitution. Because of Pakistani aggression  interference and intervention  the Republic of Afghanistan came before the Security Council in April this year. Except for a very few delegations  the overwhelming majority of countries which participated in the debate supported a political solution and the need for the implantation of the Geneva Agreements. If armed intervention and violation of the Agreements continue. Afghanistan will have no choice but to come before the Security Council once again.In conclusion. Mr. President  let me reiterate our conviction that by renewing our faith in the principles and goals of the United Nations Charter  we together  under your leadership  can contribute significantly through our deliberations and decisions in this Assembly  to the establishment of a better  safer and more orderly world for all of us to live in. My delegation stands ready to co-operate with you in reaching this goal."
"2",58,"AGO",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  today I have the honour of addressing the General Assembly for the first time and I wish to extend greetings to you both personally and on behalf of the People's Republic of Angola and best wishes for your success during this forty-fourth session of the Assembly. We are certain that your abilities aid diplomatic experience will contribute significantly to its success.We should like also to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina  who conducted the previous session with brilliance and foresight  contributing  as we all know  to its success.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  we extend our most sincere congratulations  especially on his exemplary performance in the process leading to the search for peace and prosperity for all mankind despite all the political  economic and other problems that the Organization faces.Only a few days have elapsed since the ninth summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which was held in a spirit of modernization. That conference took place at a time when positive changes were occurring in international relations. This is a situation that pleases us because we can now say that the period of the cold war is over. The super-Powers seem to have established between themselves a relationship directed towards ending confrontation and leading to a gradual reduction and dismantling of their respective arsenals  including nuclear arms. These negotiations between the major world Powers on the limitation of arms and on disarmament should be encouraged and supported by every current of opinion in our countries and around the world  as the right to choose between war and world peace should not be restricted to one country or to a small group of countries.Peace is the patrimony of all mankind  which must fight in a United bloc in order to preserve it. Peace is the indispensable and necessary condition for development and for the building of happiness aid well-being for all people. Peace  stability and security are inseparable  and since we live an interdependent world: Id the active commitment of all coin tries is necessary for the resolution of world problems.The results reached at the Reykjavik talks opened important prospects for peace for peoples all over the world and emphasized an already strong tendency towards the relaxation of tension in international relations and for the use of dialogue and negotiation as a means to resolve differences  end conflicts and eliminate those points of tension that exist in many parts of the globe.This new tendency has encouraged the peoples of Africa to engage in a courageous struggle for the liquidation of the last remnants of colonialism and racism. Aware of this reality  the South African regime  supported by some Western Powers  has engaged in armed aggression and acts of sabotage  combining direct action with the participation of mercenaries and puppet groups against the countries in the region  with the dual objective of thwarting the struggle of the peoples of Namibia and South Africa  under the respective guidance of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWATO) and the African National Congress (ANC)  their sole and legitimate representatives  and of destabilizing sovereign southern African countries in order to promote subversion and create conditions for the imposition of neo-colonial Governments submissive to the wishes of the Western Powers.The Peopled Republic of Angola  as a country fighting to win the battle against underdevelopment at all costs in order to improve the social conditions and standards of living of its people  could not isolate itself from the political context of its region. Out contribution to the solution of the problems that affect the southern region of our continent has been provided within the context of the front-line countries  to which our country has given significant support in the political and diplomatic actions undertaken to find a just solution to the problem of the decolonisation of Namibia and the elimination of the vicious apartheid system. Because of this attitude  Angola has been the victim of constant armed aggression. This climate of extreme armed violence generated by the South African aggressors has resulted in remarkable deeds by the Angolans - such as the victorious battles of Cuito Canavale  Tchipa  Calueque and Ruacana -Â· which will remain as glorious pages in the history of our resistance against the invader. In this hard struggle the Angolan people was able to count on the active commitment of Cuba and on the support of the international community  for which we are most grateful.The Government of the People's Republic of Angola has given proof of good faith and understanding in the search for the means to solve its internal conflict. In a constructive spirit  and as a clear demonstration of its peaceful policy  the Angolan Government on 22 June this year  in the presence of 18 African Heads of State at a meeting held at Gbadolite  in the Republic of Zaire  agreed upon a cessation of military hostilities  to become effective on 24 June 1989. That followed intensive consultations with various African countries regarding a series of principles that were included in the peace plan for Angola.The President of the Republic of Zaire informed us that he had established contacts with Savimbi and UNITA and that they had accepted the principles for the settlement of the internal problem in Angola. Those principles areÂ·  first  cessation of external interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola. Secondly  cessation of hostilities in all parts of the national territory  including the area around the Benguela railway  which will be considered a peace zone  and therefore used only for peaceful protest thirdly  observation of the provisions of constitutional law aid other fundamental legislation; fourthly. Integration of UNITA militants into the structure of the State'  and into other institutions  according to their capabilities; and  fifthly  acceptance of a temporary  voluntary removal of Jonas Savimbi from the Angolan political scene. Unfortunately  since the Gbadolite summit events have not proceeded at the same pace or developed positively  since the UNITA rebels have not stopped their terrorist acts or their hostile statements and propaganda against the legitimate Government of Angola. Moreover  their traditional allies have not ceased their interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of Angola. It must be remembered that we are involved in a peace process  which is not promoted by the supply of arms and increased financial aid to Jonas Savintbi.The fact that certain groups of Angolans serve as instruments for the realization of the Pretoria regime's aims in the war of aggression against Angola shows that the war against our country has an external origin. Therefore  we regret that despite all the commitments freely made by Angola - not only in the comprehensive negotiations platform of 17 November 1984  but also in the Geneva Protocol of 5 August 1988 and in the bilateral agreement between Angola and Cuba of 22 December 1988 on the withdrawal of the Cuban military contingent from the People's Republic of Angola - the UNITA rebels  in spite of the cease-fire agreed upon in Gbadolite  have carried out various attacks and ambushes. Up to the end of August there had been 2 85 attacks against the civilian population and the armed forces  199 ambushes  127 anti-personnel and mine explosions  the destruction of 58 personnel carriers by mine explosions  67 abductions  56 cases of looting  1 226 deaths  2 071 wounded  705 disappeared  one Brazilian citizen wounded  one Filipino citizen assassinated  135 houses destroyed  263 cats destroyed and 1 107 head of cattle stolen.That is the clearest evidence of the dangerous conduct of UNITA  which has thus proved to continue to be a destabilizing element  not only internally  in Angola  but also in the region as a whole.  Furthermore  the Government of the People's Republic of Angola has supported all those initiatives that would contribute  de facto  to the elimination of disagreement and war  in the interest of defending the inalienable rights of peoples to independence  sovereignty and the free choice of their political system.Racist South Africa  playing the role of gendarme in our region  is economically destabilizing the front-line countries  and especially the People's Republics of Angola and Mozambique. The actions of the bandits paid by South Africa are aimed at ensuring the realization of those objectives  and have nothing to do with the interests of the Angolan people. For that reason  their preferred targets are the social and economic infrastructure and the villages of peaceful citizens  where the greatest barbarities are committed. Beating in mind the fundamental role played by the United Nations  the Government of Angola has been informing the Secretary-General  Mt. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and the Member countries about the evolution of the situation in southern Africa in general and in particular in my own country. The Secretary-General's visits to Angola have made it possible for the highest representative of this international institution personally to witness the extent of foreign aggression and the reasons for out resort to the right of self-defence.We have had the opportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General our position regarding the origin of the conflict that has devastated our sub region and those responsible for it. My Government  within its already proven policy of flexibility and respect for the principles that govern relations between States  has presented serious proposals for the re-establishment of peace in southern Africa.Ws believe that once the apartheid system in South Africa has been dismantled out region will enter a period of peace  necessary for the development aid progress of its peoples  which will be conducive to regional and international co-operation. Particularly with the independence of Namibia  which we all hope will be achieved within the schedule initially established.The Angolan Government will not fail to make every effort in the search for a political solution to the problem of apartheid  through talks between the Government in Pretoria  the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and other valid political forces in South Africa.In fact  today the situation in Namibia presents a different scenario. With the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) an irreversible process was set in motion  beginning in April this year. We hope that it will bring an end to the last stronghold of colonialism on the African continent  despite the acts of intimidation against the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) militants and sympathizers by the Koevoet forces integrated into the South West Africa Police  which continue to carry out their activities  especially in northern Namibia. The Koevoet continues to employ tactics of counter-insurgency as well as destabilization in the south of Angola  in collaboration with the demobilized elements of the former territorial troops - the South West Africa Territory Force - especially battalions 54  101  201 and 202  which are stationed along the Angola-Namibia border aid which maintain close ties with UNITA  in a clear violation of the tripartite agreement.The People's Republic of Angola reiterates its total commitment to complying with the New York agreements  as long as there is a corresponding compliance by the other patties aid the efforts made for Namibia's transition from colonialism to independence are made under conditions of stability and justice  lb this end  in accordance with the New York agreements regarding peace in south-west Africa; we should like to refer on the one hand to the more than 22 600 internationalists from Cuba who have already returned to their country and on the other hand to the SWAPO elements which ate new  as was agreed  north of parallel 16 and under the control of the United Nations representative in Angola. The efforts of the Secretary-General in search of a just negotiated solution to the conflict concerning Western Sahara have merited the encouragement of the Angolan Government. We hope the contacts between His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco and the POÅISARIO Front will continue opening the way for the implementation of the United Nations and Organization of African Unity resolutions on this matter.A matter of equal importance to the people and the Government of Angola is that of the Maubere people  which has struggled for 14 years against the foreign occupation of its territory. We reaffirm once again our appreciation of the position taken by the Portuguese Government as administering Power of that Territory  and we urge the Secretary-General to make every effort in the search for a just and lasting solution based on the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Territory and relevant United Nations resolutions.We must commend the efforts of the Korean people towards the peaceful reunification of their country  without foreign intervention based on dialogue and consultations between North and South  in compliance with the principles established in the Joint North-South Declaration of 4 July 1972.We salute the positive developments towards resolution of the situation in Kampuchea  reflected in the actions of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in withdrawing its forces stationed in Kampuchea.Following the April 1988 Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan  we called upon the signatories to fulfil their commitments with a view to establishing a climate of peace  security and stability in South-East Asia.We encourage the Central American States to continue on the path they have chosen to find negotiated political solutions. We are convinced that the peace agreements recently concluded in Honduras will greatly contribute to the implementation of the Esquipulas II agreements. We reiterate our active solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people which under the aegis of the Palestine Liberation Organization is waging a tenacious struggle for the liberation of its territory and for the establishment of an independent State comprising the entire territory of Palestine  including Jerusalem.We support the efforts of the tripartite committee created by the League of Arab States to seek a negotiated political solution to the fratricidal conflict in Lebanon.We are sure that sufficient change will take place to permit peace to be restored in all regions of the planet where war situations persist and to ensure that respect for the rights of peoples and States to freedom and independence will lead to a common path of economic and social development.In speaking of the role played by the United Nations  one cannot overlook the highly positive contribution of the non-aligned countries and their Movement  which has greatly influenced action in favour of halting the arms race  reducing nuclear and conventional arsenals aid gradually easing pockets of regional tension.We find ourselves at the end of yet another decade unfortunately characterized by deep stagnation with respect to the economic development of our countries. In some countries the economic situation is even worse than that of 20 years ago. Since the Common Fund for commodities  under the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  came into effect last June  a few successes have been achieved in the field of international trade. While these are not significant enough to efface the spectre of the weak results obtained  they encourage us in our long  hard-fought struggle for the establishment of a new international economic order.It is for that reason that we want to reaffirm our total commitment to the holding next April of a special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation  and in particular on revitalizing economic growth and development  which will undoubtedly constitute an important step towards the adoption of a new international development strategy which we all hope will produce better results than previous ones.As we again examine the current economic situation in our countries we ate compelled to express our great concern with respect to the worsening of the problems faced by the international financial system and the consequences for our countries' already weak economies. Huge loans  along with high interest rates and the unprecedented fall in commodity prices  have aggravated the problem of the foreign debt of developing countries  a problem which has placed those countries in such an absurd situation that they are today repaying more to the developed countries and international financial institutions that they receive in loans. In my view that situation cannot continue because it threatens the social  economic and even political feasibility of our existence as States. We therefore consider it timely and urgent that an international conference be held on financial and monetary questions for the solution of this crucial problem.When we gathered recently in Belgrade at the latest summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  we recognized that increased South-South co-operation is vital as one way to ease the present economic crisis - not as an alternative to co-operation with the North  which is also a priority  but as a means of finding other solutions to this problem  a problem that faces us all and threatens the existence of all.It is also paramount now to devote special attention to the African continent  where the critical economic situation of its States has reached unprecedented levels. Hunger  malnutrition  epidemic diseases and natural disasters have made any attempt at economic development impossible  to the point where 26 of the 36 least developed countries in the world are on the African continent. We deplore the weak commitment of the international community  which has made it impossible for the United Nations Programme of action for African Economic Recovery and Development to succeed despite the efforts made by African countries  in some case with enormous social sacrifices. Added to those factors is the enormous foreign debt the continent faces today  a debt that has already exceeded the astronomic sum of 3230 billion  forcing most African countries into a level of debt servicing that is incompatible with their development needs.The increasing deterioration of the environment  the depletion of the ozone layer and  especially  the flow towards developing countries of toxic wastes ""exported"" by developed countries have in recent years been the focus of attention by the international community. The People's Republic of Angola unconditionally condemns all such negative activities  which are incompatible with the already critical economic development of those countries. We stress the importance  indeed the urgency  of holding a second conference on environment and development  since we believe it would provide an ideal opportunity to deal jointly with these questions.The People's Republic of Angola  located in the southern part of the African continent  unfortunately cannot escape the critical economic situation facing that continent. The People's Republic of Angola has recently joined the International Monetary Fund as a full member of that important international financial institution. We should like to take this opportunity to excess our deepest appreciation to all the countries which  though their contributions  made it possible for us to join. We do not deny the importance of joining the International Monetary Fund  particularly as this relates to the successful implementation of our economic and financial recovery programme  which we in the People's Republic of Angola have been implementing for several years. The economic recovery programme of our com try places priority on restructuring the foreign debt valued at 94 966 million  and on the rescheduling of the terms of repayment in order to re-establish the financial flow of exports and to make possible a global volume of trade compatible with the domestic levels of consumption and projected investments.The programme concentrates equally on attracting foreign investment  which will be principally directed toward the export rather than the import sector  with a view to restoring production and increasing wages and the availability of consumer goods. The People's Republic of Angola is a country with enormous economic potential  and we trust that we can make further advances in those areas and in continued pursuit of better living conditions for our people.In conclusion  we should like to take this opportunity to launch an appeal to the international community for at increase in its support and material aid to the programmes the People's Republic of Angola is implementing to counter the effects of the war that can still be felt in our country and losses that now exceed 912 billion. The emergency situation in the People's Republic of Angola has been rendered more acute by a drought in its southern region and floods in the north.In that context  a conference on the emergency situation was held in Angola on 22 September  the positive results of which will be a symbolic contribution towards minimizing the difficulties affecting the sectors of public health and agriculture  which most urgently require supplementary assistance.Allow me  Mr. President  to reiterate our best wishes for success in the proceedings of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly  end to assure you of the Angolan delegation's co-operation in any way that may be necessary.

"3",105,"ALB",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania  I have the pleasure to address to you  Sir  the representative of a friendly African nation  our congratulations on your election to the high office of President of the current session of the General Assembly.I would also extend my congratulations to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  on his efforts and his commitment to strengthening the role of the United Nations in coping with the acute problems of our time in the cause of peace and security.The Albanian delegation  like the delegations of the overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations  has come to this session of the General Assembly with the sincere desire to join its efforts with those of other States for the improvement of the international atmosphere and the promotion of international security. There is no doubt that an open and constructive debate free of reservations and preconceptions about present world developments would contribute to the success of this debate. The Albanian delegation believes that the present-day international situation is complex. In many cases  developments are as contradictory as they are fluid and unstable. They are characterized by a relaxation of tension in some areas and an increase in others  while the settlement of a problem in one region is accompanied by the emergence and exacerbation of problems in another. The current political dialogue in the relations between the two super-Powers  which has found concrete expression in their agreements on a number of minor arms reductions or in their steps to eliminate certain hot-beds of regional conflict  have led to a relative easing of tension. Efforts are frequently made to portray this as a qualitative change in present-day international relations or as an irreversible trend towards international peace and security  a new era. But past experience and present developments force us to recognize that the present relaxation of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union is no guarantee that threat of war has been eliminated. Today  interference in the internal affairs of others has increased under various pretexts and threatens to upset the balance  with incalculable consequences.Albania is in favour of improving the atmosphere and easing the tension in Europe. It is for peace and the strengthening of security cm our continent. The ways these problems are regarded and the paths leading to their solution may differ from State to State  but it is essential that the policy and concrete actions of each of these States help to attain that goal. We feel that Albania  by pursuing a fully independent policy outside all blocs and permitting no foreign bases and troops on its territory  has done and continues to serve the cause of security and peace in Europe.In the field of disarmament  too  the agreements between the two super-Powers are minimal and have not affected the enormous arsenals of weapons of every sort in their possession. Declarations of impressive proposals and counter-proposals concerning deep cuts of up to 50 per cent in strategic weapons cannot conceal the arms race  which continues  or the manufacture of new generations of ever more modern and sophisticated weapons. So true is this that we now have good reason to state that the dividing line between the dangers of nuclear arms and the dangers of conventional arms has almost disappeared. We believe that the problems of disarmament can be confronted and set on the road to solution through the collective and individual efforts and actions of all States.At a time when the arms race continues  when hot-beds of tension and crisis persist  the interests of peace call for the adoption of effective measures towards disarmament  the dismantling of political and military blocs  the removal of foreign bases and the return of foreign armies within their national borders  and the cessation of all interference in the internal affairs of other States.Prom time to time the super-Powers set forth new theories and political doctrines  as well as ideas and models  which they seek to impose on others  presenting them as almost universal criteria for the development of democratic processes  and which they attempt to establish  in one way or another  as pre-conditions for relations between States. Albania maintains that peoples and States must be free to choose their own paths to sovereign development  to preserve their national identity  and to play their rightful role in the course of world events.Albania is and always has been in favour of a democratisation of international relations that would allow all States  large and small  to make their voices heard. In light of that necessity  the role of the United Nations in international affairs becomes even more significant. As the experience of the past two or three years has shown  the commitment of the United Nations to solving certain critical problems is an indication of the potentials and importance it can have when it plays its true role in accordance with the Charter. We believe that the important problems of our time should not be left for discussion by only a narrow circle of States or to a dialogue by the super-Powers; rather  they must be brought to the United Nations. That would confirm the weight and power of the international community.It is certainly in the international community's interest to avoid regional crises and conflicts  since these constitute hot-beds of tension exacerbated and manipulated by others against the interests of the peoples. Thus  it is the parties directly involved and concerned in these conflicts and crises  and not external forces  that should play the decisive roles in settling them. Short-term solutions  especially those imposed from without  cannot endure. In our view  the formula of ""national reconciliation""  applied under the tutelage of the super-Powers  leaves the door open for interference and destabilization; the case of Afghanistan is an example of that. In the interests of independent development and peace  interference in Central America and South-East Asia must cease  and the solutions to their problems must conform to the aspirations of the peoples concerned. Similarly  the Korean people must not be prevented from achieving the reunification of its homeland free from outside interference.As a Mediterranean country  Albania considers that any step towards the creation of a favourable political climate in the Mediterranean requires the withdrawal of the super-Powers' fleets and warships. That step would help to make it a sea of peace and friendship among the peoples of the countries that border on it  and a bridge of co-operation with the other regions of the world.When we speak of the Mediterranean  we cannot help thinking of Lebanon  which is living through a veritable tragedy. Israel and the forces of reaction have imposed on it a lengthy fratricidal war with extremely serious consequences. It is for the Lebanese people itself to establish its own national unity in all sovereignty. In the Middle East  the Arab peoples have been fighting against imperialist-Zionist aggression for several decades. Standing out in that context is the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people  bearing living witness to the dauntless efforts of a valiant people that cannot be conquered by violence or tanks  nor by the genocide practised by those that commit aggression against it.The Albanian people and Government have always felt close to the fraternal Arab peoples and their just struggle. We regard the proclamation of the Palestinian State and its international recognition as a very important development  offering greater possibilities for the settlement of that key problem in the Middle East. The uprising of the Palestinian people - the intifadah - which has been going on for nearly two years in the occupied territories  enjoys the unreserved support of the Albanian people as a legitimate struggle. The Albanian people has also hailed the positive steps towards the strengthening of unity in the Arab world  which it considers to be a decisive factor in the just settlement of the Palestinian problem and of the Middle East crisis as a whole.Against the background of developments and endeavours to achieve political settlements of conflicts and hotbeds of tension the cease-fire agreement in Angola and the agreement on the granting independence to Namibia cannot fail to have a considerable impact on the over-all situation in the southern part of the African continent. The Albanian delegation condemns the violence and crimes of the South African regime  which continues to persist in its detested colonialist policy of racial discrimination.The Albanian people support the African countries in their just struggle against imperialist neo-colonialist exploitation. We associate ourselves with the efforts of the Organization of African Unity to strengthen its unity in support of the struggle of the Azanian people to put an end to the hated apartheid regime in South Africa  an anachronism in the modern world that constitutes a challenge to all mankind. Looking back over the development of events in the world since the last session of the United Nations General Assembly  we witness an intensification of internal contradictions in a number of countries  the negative consequences of which extend far beyond national borders. Multinational States  which are a reality in today's world  cannot speak of genuine democracy so long as they fail to achieve democratic relations among the nations  nationalities and minorities that comprise them  if an aggravation of inter-ethnic relations is being observed today  that shows that in those States ethnic or national issues have not been properly addressed.Albania has always maintained that minorities  wherever they may be  should enjoy equal rights with the rest of a country's population  in keeping with the norms of international law. We have always maintained that minorities should be important factors for rapprochement and friendship between peoples and States. Recently a process of co-operation has begun among the countries of the Balkans. The meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Balkan States that was held last year has been followed by a number of other activities of a political  economic  scientific and technical character. That process constitutes a positive trend that reflects the fundamental interests of the peoples of the peninsula and the cause of peace in the region and in all of Europe. The peoples of our peninsula aspire to and need peace and understanding  co-operation and friendship  and not destabilization and mutual animosity.The Albanian Government will work tirelessly to ensure that that process does not come to a halt but that it is  instead  advanced and consolidated. We hope and we wish that the other Balkan countries will do likewise  overcoming certain recent developments that run counter to the spirit of understanding and to the commitments undertaken within the context of Balkan co-operation.Albania has never interfered - nor does it intend to interfere - in the internal affairs of other States. However  prompted by a sincere concern about the fostering of Balkan co-operation and confidence  as well as out of a sense of moral justice and on the basis of democratic and other humane considerations enshrined in the United Nations Charter and in other international instruments  my country cannot fail to mention the tragic events that occurred in Kosovo in the spring of this year  along with the repression of the Albanians and their national democratic rights  events that continue today and that are in defiance of every norm of freedom  of democracy and of social and cultural emancipation. The Albanian Government and people - along with world public opinion  including that of sound Yugoslav circles - have condemned and continue to condemn the killing and imprisonments of hundreds of thousands of Albanians who are calling for equality and for the same rights as are enjoyed by fellow-citizens in their federal state and for the retention of their autonomy  language  culture and national traditions.White papers or yellow literature may be produced  but they cannot justify the fact that the law in Kosovo is made by tanks and policeman or that  following the constitutional amendments  the number of Albanian schools has been reduced aid the Kosovo intellectuals and youth are being persecuted. The so-called differentiation  which in fact constitutes isolation  an unprecedented and inhuman moral  economic and political boycott  has affected the best-known intellectuals  academicians and teachers  down to the school-children themselves.Albania has been and remains directly concerned to ensure the stabilization of the situation in Yugoslavia  since the freedom and independence of both countries are linked. Any evil in one country affects the other. The normalization of the situation in Kosovo  the national and economic emancipation of the Albanians in Yugoslavia  where they make up an entity of some 3 million inhabitants  and recognition of their equality of rights with the other national groups and nationalities of the Federation  would serve to strengthen Yugoslavia itself.The interests of the peoples of the region require that the bitter legacy of the past be overcome and that no new difficulties be added; instead  real efforts should be made to improve the friendly atmosphere and to strengthen fruitful co-operation. As has been announced  in the autumn of next year the second meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Balkan States will be held in Albania. It is our desire that  through the concerted efforts of all States of the region  facing up to present-day realities  that important meeting will mark a new and more advanced stage in our work towards multilateral co-operation and strengthened relations of good-neighbourliness. We are sure that that will be the case. We regard good-neighbourliness as the expression of mutual obligations and of the desire and interests of our peoples and countries to live in peace aid friendship with one another. Albania  which has sincerely committed itself to the process of Balkan co-operation  regards it as a realistic alternative for strengthening peace in the region. It considers that  as a part of Europe  the Balkans  which has suffered so much from feuds  upheavals and wars  needs peace  tranquillity and stability today more than ever in order to overcome the bitter past and the region's relative backwardness when compared with the rest of the continent  as well as to demonstrate our region's interest in  and contribution to  the development of positive European processes compatible with peace.An important aspect of the democratisation of international relations which is making itself felt greatly today is that of economic relations or. the world scale. Inequality in trade exchanges  the imposition of protectionist measures and tariff barriers and the widespread use of the loan mechanism by the developed industrial countries have widened the economic gap between them and the developing countries. The fact that this situation persists and is worsening is directly affecting the stability of international relations  in which economic relations - more so today than ever before -- are inseparably intertwined with political relations.It is not easy to understand appeals for detente and for the strengthening of international security when some industrialized countries are becoming richer and richer by exploiting developing countries  among others  and the developing countries are becoming poorer every day. Nowadays  when the question of human rights has become a subject for concern and a burning issue to the extent that it has become politicised in the extreme  even in cases which involve individuals  can one really put any faith in the concern expressed when a blind eye is turned to the fate of the millions of people in various parts of the world under threat of famine? The demands of the developing countries - which are frequently referred to as the ""poor men's club"" although they represent an overwhelming majority of United Nations Member States - for equality to be established in international economic relations are legitimate  should be heard out and proper answer made to them. The illicit trafficking in and the use of drugs have now become a social problem and social evil in many countries. The phenomenon has never occurred in Albania and is not occurring there now. A healthy tradition and educational measures apart  the State  through strict laws  provides for severe punishments for the illegal use  possession and sale of narcotics. At the same time  Albania has taken steps to block any possible traffic in drugs throughout its territory. We think that the fight against drugs should not be used as a cover for particular political designs.In our time  ecological problems have become extremely acute  and the danger resulting from the pollution of the environment has increased even more. It is now an acknowledged fact that the most serious ecological damage due to pollution on the world scale is being caused by the super industrialized countries  which are the greatest consumers and processors of raw materials. The concern in this regard is all the greater when one is aware that some of these countries are dumping their technological wastes  some with radioactive content  in developing countries.Albania  which is itself demonstrating the greatest concern to protect the environment within its own territory  including the Adriatic region  joins with those other countries which are rightly demanding that those who are most responsible for pollution should feel obliged to improve the situation and solve the problem.For the Albanian people  which has had a centuries-long struggle for its territory  freedom and existence  the safeguarding of its independence and full national sovereignty is sacred. With the principle of independence at the foundation of its policy  Albania has at the same time made its modest contribution to the cause of peace and security. It has established and maintains fair  fruitful and friendly relations with the great majority of countries  which is why our country has felt and still feels that it is an integral and active part of the international community.The reality of Albania in the 45 years since Liberation and the changes and progress made in many areas are the happy outcome of the socialist course it has taken. The fact that the population has tripled over these four decades while average life expectancy has increased from 38 years at Liberation to 72 years today is proof of the far-reaching economic and social changes that have been made in my country.We are well aware that  despite everything our people has done in Albania through the labour of its hands and the sweat of its brow  we are not at the end of the road  but the important thing is that we are convinced that our road is the right one and opens up to us the prospect of continued progress.Wishing that the work of this Assembly should be conducted in the most constructive spirit possible and to the benefit of peace  the Albania  delegation will not fail to make its contribution towards attaining this goal."
"4",173,"ARE",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to extend to you  Sir  on behalf of the United Arab Emirates  my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. This election reflects the deep appreciation of the international community for the constructive role played by your country  Nigeria  in Africa as well as in respect of other international issues. It is also a token of esteem for your diplomatic experience.I am pleased to extend sincere thanks to your predecessor  the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  for his performance as President of the last session.I also seize this opportunity to reiterate the Government's confidence in the Secretary-General  and our appreciation for his efforts in resolving international problems and conflicts.September the first marked the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War - a war that devastated the structures and resources of many countries and took a toll of millions of dead or wounded.This was the incentive that moved the founding fathers who framed the United Nations Charter to create the mechanisms of the Organization and a code of international behaviour that would  if adhered to and respected  prevent the outbreak of armed conflicts and wars. Indeed  the United Nations Charter prohibits the resort to war and the use of force  except in the case of self-defence. The founding fathers envisioned the creation of a new international order based on peace and security  and the achievement of the goal of universal equality and justice.The era of the United Nations has been characterized by an absence of world wars hence humanity has been saved from the scourge of global destruction. However  this has not prevented the eruption of numerous wars and conflicts in the third world. Let us bear in mind that so-called regional conflicts are but extensions of international conflicts. Therefore  the resolution of those original conflicts can be achieved only within the context of a positive international climate. That is why the present detente between the two super-Powers has been welcomed by all peoples of the world: it has had a positive effect on regional disputes and conflicts. We sincerely hope that no regional conflict will be excluded from that process under the pressure of certain circumstances.In this context  we cannot but welcome the recent agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union. It is our firm belief that the agreements will reinforce the process of detente and enhance our faith that mankind may be spared the threat of weapons of mass destruction.International principles and fundamental concepts  especially the right to self-determination  should not suffer as a result of those developments and the new positive international climate that augurs well for mutual understanding between the peoples of the world. The enthusiasm surrounding detente should not make us overlook the fundamental rights of peoples that are still struggling for national political and economic independence. There are also peoples combating racial discrimination  as in South Africa  and peoples that are victims of foreign military occupation  as in Palestine. International peace and understanding cannot be sustained if they promote the interests of certain parties at the expense of others; otherwise  we shall be planting the seeds of tension for future generations.If history is any guide  we may look to the future with the hope that the present policy of detente will lead to durable entente. The attainment of such a goal will transform current attitudes and values  with progress  stability and prosperity becoming the arenas of competition  and economic and social development becoming a universal right and an established fact everywhere. We also hope that this understanding will make us confront the new dangerous problems  such as the those of pollution and narcotic drug abuse  which threaten all nations  big and small  and all individuals  rich and poor.We meet here every year to discuss our problems and concerns. Our priorities may differ  depending on our geographic locations  economic interests and political or religious persuasions. Despite those differences  we all aspire to build a world free from threats  persecution and injustice  a world in which we appreciateeach other's hopes and feel each other's pain. Against this background  we should like to share with representatives the concerns of the region to which we belong.Our region confronts old problems  such as that of Palestine and those that have ensued from it  making the Middle East a region of permanent tension. Our region also faces new problems  such as the Iran-Iraq war and its effects. More than a year has elapsed since the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq began. The United Arab Emirates was in the forefront of the countries that welcomed that important development. We considered the ceasefire to be the first step towards the settlement of all outstanding problems between the two countries and towards finding a just and peaceful settlement enshrining the legitimate rights of the two countries.The stalemate in the negotiations - in other words  the current no peace  no war situation - does not serve the interests of either country. We all have a strong interest in the restoration of peace to the area. Therefore  we hope that a new round of direct negotiations will begin soon. While we appreciate the role and efforts of the Secretary-General  it is incumbent upon us to urge the two parties to overcome existing obstacles in order to move the peace process towards the desired goal.The problem of Palestine is perhaps unique in modern political history. Several wars and numerous political attempts and initiatives have failed to achieve a conclusive settlement and to restore peace to that part of the world.In reviewing the evolution of the problem  we find it shocking to note the enormous amount of resources and energies wasted in the efforts that have been made to resolve it  yet the issue  in essence  is clear. The problem lies in an attempt to deprive a people of its land and to stamp out its national identity. Every day Israel comes up with new excuses and pretexts  whose purpose is to prevent thePalestinian people from exercising self-determination and to deprive the region of peace and stability.The Palestinian people  represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization  responded constructively and with a high degree of responsibility to the new international climate  as is evidenced by the peace initiative offered by the Palestine National Council at its meeting in Algiers in November 1988. By continuously entertaining the dream of Greater Israel and implementing the racist Zionist theory  Israel is persistently perpetuating its psychological complex and its ideology by lopsided logic. This is manifested in the election plan suggested for the West Bank and Gaza by the Prime Minister of Israel  which included the following conditions: that elections should not lead to negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization  the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the occupied territories or the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Palestinians.The Israeli Prime Minister also insisted that the elections be held under the guns of the Israeli occupation forces. One might therefore ask: elections for whom  and what is the purpose behind them? The only logical answer is that the Israeli Government's proposal is nothing but a propaganda ploy  on the one hand  to improve Israel's image in democratic Western societies  and  on the other  to relieve Israel of the pressures of the intifadah as well as international pressures.Throughout its long years of struggle the Palestinian people has made great sacrifices; it has made greater sacrifices in order to promote peace efforts. It would be a big mistake to assume  on the basis of recent developments  that the Palestinian people will ever surrender its land or its national identity on the altar of an unjust political settlement.Events clearly show that the Palestinian people is determined to continue its resistance and defend its land through its valiant intifadah  which will have completed its second year by the end of the current session. The Palestinians will continue their struggle  despite the brutal oppression of the Israeli military machine and its inhuman practices  and despite the fact that innocent children and young men and women are martyred every day on their national soil.We believe that no settlement plan will prove viable unless it takes into consideration the right of the Palestinian people to exercise national self-determination and to establish its own independent State in Palestine. We also believe that the nature of the problem and the circumstances surrounding it make its settlement impossible outside the international context in which the problem initially originated; hence the need for an international peace conference in which all the parties should participate  including the Palestine Liberation Organization and the five permanent members of the Security Council. All attempts that do not follow that approach and have that goal are doomed to failure.Another problem that still persists in our region is the crisis situation in Lebanon. We welcome the results reached by the Tripartite High Arab Committee and the acceptance by the Lebanese parties of the Committee's plan of action. We still believe that a final settlement of the Lebanese civil war can ultimately be achieved through understanding and dialogue between the Lebanese themselves on the basis of brotherhood  tolerance and a sincere desire to resolve all outstanding problems  without involving foreign elements in this domestic affair. We appeal to all foreign Powers that have influence in Lebanon to refrain from adding difficulties to the Lebanese problem and to stop their intervention in Lebanon's internal affairs. We appeal also to the international community to help Lebanon at this critical stage to regain its full independence and restore its full sovereignty over its territory through the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  calling on Israel to withdraw its forces from south Lebanon and stop its intervention in internal Lebanese affairs.While we look forward to the day when Namibia joins us a free and independent State and is able to exercise its role as a member of this international body after several decades of bitter struggle against the occupation by the racist regime of South Africa  we are increasingly worried about the future of the black majority in South Africa. The record indicates that the racist minority regime in South Africa is not yet ready to give up its policy of apartheid and oppression against the black majority. We hope that international pressure against the minority regime will not be relaxed. All efforts must be focused on the eradication of racism  as it has become irrefutably demonstrated that it cannot be reformed and that dealing with it can only reinforce its atrocious ideology.The situations in Afghanistan  Cyprus and Kampuchea still require further endeavours aimed at reaching a final settlement in a manner that reflects the wishes of the peoples of those countries and the principles of the Charter. Despite relative improvement resulting from efforts undertaken to settle them  these problems still represent areas of tension.We welcome the endeavours of the Presidents of Central America to bring to an end a decade of turbulence and strife in that region. The participation of the Secretary-General in these attempts will be a guarantee of their success. With respect to disarmament  important steps have been taken over the past two years  especially the agreements concluded between the two major military alliances. These agreements were the result of the detente between the two super-Powers. Of course  the road that lies ahead is still long. Quantitative reductions must be accompanied by qualitative reductions. Military tests and research must also come to a halt since they entail the waste of so many resources. We endorse the idea of transferring funds saved as a result of disarmament to development programmes  especially in the third world.While significant progress has been made in the political sphere  developments in the field of international economic co-operation may give rise to pessimism. Following the stock market crash of 1987  world economic conditions have improved with increased trade and total output  contrary to expectations. However  world economic expansion has been asymmetrical. While the developed and the industrialized countries registered higher economic growth rates  the economies of Latin America and Africa have deteriorated  with declining growth rates. Consequently the per capita income gap between the rich and the poor countries continues to grow.The single most formidable issue confronting the world community  as we embark on the next decade  is the resolution of the indebtedness of the least developed countries. The developing countries have been so encumbered by their debt obligations that interest payments alone to the creditors since the mid-1980s have far outstripped the total value of aid received by the developing nations. In 1988 those countries paid out $50 billion  in interest alone  more than they received in aid. This situation has further undermined the efforts of the developing countries to pursue economic growth rate policies. Debts and interests  in simple terms of figures  underscore the imperative for debt reduction  and in this connection wewelcome the Brady plan as a positive development. However  the solution to the debt problem will be contingent on the degree of co-operation and shared efforts of the debtors  creditors  commercial banks  national Governments and international institutions.The instability in the international financial system should be cause for concern to the policy makers. Persistent trade deficits in the key industrialized countries and the inconsistency in their adjustment policies have put an enormous strain on the international financial system. The reverberations felt throughout the world financial markets in the aftermath of the crash in the United States of America is testimony to that fact.The continued volatility in exchange rates and interest rates has eroded the confidence of investors and  consequently  led to a deterioration in the world economy.We believe that the existing international system is not adequately equipped to cope with these strains and efforts at restructuring international economic relations on the basis of justice  equality and mutual interests must therefore continue. To this end the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  which is to take place in the spring of 1990  provides an excellent opportunity for members to review the North-South dialogue and to seek agreement on principles that should guide their co-operation in the years to come. This would lay the foundation for the adoption  later in 1990  of an international development strategy that would be the basis for realistic and genuine agreement on the commitments of all nations to tackle the huge problems of poverty  development and the environment that beset our planet.The general debate will conclude in a few days. Many statements were made and more will follow. Most of them expressed confidence in the future and reflectedthe hopes of some and the suffering of others. What is most important is that we preserve the achievements of international co-operation. Indeed  our overriding objective should be the preservation of this international Organization  which brings us together. It is also important that by the time we meet next we should find that suffering has been transformed into hope and hopes into realities. First and foremost  this requires confidence  confidence in our abilities as human beings and confidence in each other as States.Big projects always start with small steps. Let us march together on the road towards a world in which love  co-operation  security and prosperity reign supreme."
"5",220,"ARG",44,1989,"ï»¿ I should like to begin by congratulating you  Mr. President  on your election to head the work of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. You represent Africa  a continent linked to the most difficult and successful of the struggles of the United Nations  You also represent a country  Nigeria  that has played a significant role in promoting the principles and purposes of the Organization's Charter. We know of your efforts in the Special Committee against Apartheid  and in you we see a standard bearer in the fight to eradicate the vile practice of racial discrimination from southern Africa.I should also like to salute the outgoing President  Mr. Dante Caputo  who  on behalf of our country  accepted the responsibility of presiding over the General Assembly.I have always believed it to be impossible to imagine the future of one's country without reflecting upon the reality of the world around us  impossible to have a correct national vision without a correct international vision  impossible to progress if we cover our eyes and grope our way forward without knowing what is going on in a constantly changing world.For that reason  here in this highest forum I wish to speak about some of our concerns  goals and ambitions. I wish to talk about our fears and also about our hopes. I wish to talk about risks and also opportunities. In short  I have come to share with you our dreams and our realities.What is politics  if not the focal point of our will and our ideas? History summons us  and we cannot turn our backs on it. There is a challenge before us  there is a clamour around us; there is an inescapable responsibility. The twenty-first century must be the century of a true renascence. It will demand greatness to do away with selfish criteria that are merely partisan  ideological  class-related  religious or racial. It will demand intelligence to understand the problems of our times from a global standpoint. It will demand resolve if we are not to confine ourselves to mere words.Today  to defend what is ours we must be aware of everyone's world. What was a humanitarian option yesterday is now an imperative. We feel that we are all united in the face of great world problems that require co-operation and responses in a spirit of solidarity.There is only one world. There is only one human dignity. There is only one home for all mankind. An understanding of those realities is not a minor detail of the history through which we are living. What is at stake is the difference between peace and war  between progress and decadence  between development and poverty  between life and death.The century that is about to end has been marked by unprecedented technological and scientific progress  but it has also been marked by atrocious wars  by genocide and by new threats. We must be aware of that interplay of light and shadow  and we must prepare ourselves to ensure that the twenty-first century will be set upon the right road towards the desired harmony.I think that the time has come to reformulate old ideas  to dust them off and update them and to make them consonant with the contemporary world; that is why the concept of international security must be re-adapted to the new realities. Today  insecurity is no longer limited merely to the danger of a nuclear confrontation between super-Powers. There is another world insecurity: it is the risk that the world may once again be split up  this tine into North and South; it is the inability to harmonize economic development on a global scale. There can be no peace or international order in a world given over to the irrationality of inequality. For decades we have been appealing to the conscience of universal peace  that everything be done to end the East-West split.Today  here and now  we must do likewise to avoid the equally dangerous North-South split  which would bring us into the twenty-first century with two totally opposite universes: a rich  affluent society facing a majority of increasingly impoverished countries. In the same way  it is necessary to give deep thought to the dangers threatening the ecological balance and the human environment.For all of us  man cannot become the predator of man. """"Our planet is not a degradable entity. Development is not a mere mathematical equation. Technology is not a mirage that must merely destroy mankind's home. An appropriate form of production must be founded on wise management of renewable resources and decreasing consumption of irreplaceable raw materials and energy. Furthermore  it is necessary to rescue the cultural values  the quality of life  the style and tradition that are inherent in the identity of every nation. It is essential to encourage man's progressive rediscovery of nature  water  earth  air  plants and the animals of creation. These are substantive issues that require a political awareness and a resolute response before it is too late.The concern of philosophers  sociologists  anthropologists  theologians and poets can no longer proceed independently of the mediocre universe of the policy of mere efficiency. I do not believe in the illusory domination that involves a real danger to the destiny of the world. The United Nations is the ideal forum in which to forge that conscience required by changing circumstances. It is obvious  furthermore  that the present political horizon does give us reason for hope. We can see a climate of detente taking shape not only at the level of ideological-political opposition between the super-Powers  but also in regional conflicts. In the last five years we have seen concrete steps taken along that long road towards overcoming the cold-war climate.Solid progress has been achieved in disarmament  such as the historic 1988 treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States. Such progress may point to the beginning of the definitive overcoming of the irrational arms race. That event is exemplary because it has positive repercussions on other conflicts.I think we should all thank the Secretary-General for his determination  his wise  concrete  untiring and hopeful activities - even at times when it seemed impossible to have any reason to feel hopeful. Suffice it to recall the progress made towards peace in the conflict between Iraq and Iran  and in defusing the problems of Cyprus and Afghanistan. With regard to the questions of Kampuchea and the Western Sahara  we hope that the Secretary-General will continue to receive the support that is essential for the final attainment of peace.It is also our hope that a fair solution can be reached on the Korean issue. We sincerely hope that next November elections will be held in Namibia and that its long-suffering people may be represented at the next session of the General Assembly and that we may welcome it to our midst as a new independent and democratic State. That will be a decisive step towards normalizing the situation in the southern cone of the African continent.But much more is needed  without the final eradication of apartheid in South Africa  the spark of violence will not be extinguished  what kind of peace can be guaranteed if it is based on silence with respect to the exclusion and daily violation of the most elemental human right  the right to equality?We Argentines have a special debt of gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for the role he has played in regard to our regional conflict - that of the Malvinas Islands. This issue is directly linked to peace and disarmament. From the moment our Government came to power  we have sought to join in the general climate of detente. That is why we have taken positive measures. We have extended our hand  showing our willingness to enter into dialogue  while in no way casting any doubt on our historical and inalienable rights to sovereignty over those South Atlantic islands. The recent concrete steps taken at our initiative are well known. The normalization of bilateral dialogue must be followed by a firm and sensible will to bring an end to an obsolete colonial situation that is historically unsustainable.This is the appropriate occasion for me to express to the representatives of the vast majority of countries represented here the deep gratitude of the Argentine people. On repeated occasions you have expressed your overwhelming support for our just claim. That attitude and that complete support encourage our hopes for a fair and peaceful solution of this conflict. I should like to assert that we shall struggle unstintingly and peacefully  with reason and perseverance  to recover our Malvinas Islands.Among the regional conflicts  one which naturally involves us is that of Central America. We favour a negotiated political solution  without external interference. The countries directly involved must find their own solutions. Experience has shown this to be the proper approach. Agreements such as the Tela Declaration reached by the Central American Presidents are proof of that. There can be no solutions if we directly or indirectly disregard the principle of non-intervention. Likewise  conflicts would only increase if attempts were made to postpone the full implementation of democratic pluralism and freedom. The question of the Middle East deserves careful reflection. That region is a historical cross-roads of culture. Like any zone of conflict  it can become and indeed has become an area of failure and danger. It is a particularly acute area of danger because of its geopolitical position and the heterogeneous interests that it involves. Cur country reaffirms the need to find an urgent solution for all opposing sectors. That is to say  the solution must include respect for the rights of all parties concerned to self-determination and to live within recognized and safe boundaries. Those rights are applicable equally to Israel and to the Palestinian people. Much has been achieved in the field of intentions and declarations  but  unfortunately  Palestine remains a land of death  pain and growing hatred. Lebanon  in its unfortunate situation  is flagrant proof of the inability to attain peaceful solutions. Our country favours the convening of an international peace conference within the framework of the United Nations in order to bring peace to that region and to negotiate an eventual agreement that will include solid international guarantees until the time when the situation is normalized. That method has made it possible to find appropriate solutions in equally dangerous circumstances. In any event  we shall support any type of negotiation which the parties may agree to with a view to putting an end to the bloodshed.Our country has sizeable Arab and Jewish communities; they coexist peacefully with their own lifestyles  traditions and religious beliefs. I myself am a descendant of one of those communities and I can bear witness to our modest but not insignificant experience. We Argentines believe  as do any people strengthened by the most heterogeneous immigration  that men can live in peace  whatever their creed  race or colour. Therefore  feeling this problem as one very close to my own heart and experience  I have offered the good offices of my Government  and my own  to work towards a rapprochement of the parties involved  if they so wish  according to the method that they deem appropriate. We are aware of the enormous difficulties of the problem  but we have not wanted to skimp in our efforts or availability with respect to any concrete initiative.Beyond the problems of peace and disarmament  our Organization must devote its efforts to new issues which  because of their magnitude  are becoming the major universal issues of our generation.Almost every country is the victim of drug trafficking  whether as a producer  a consumer or an intermediary. This extremely serious problem can be combated only if the international community acts in concert and energetically  pursuing with equal severity drug consumption  trafficking and production. International criminal organizations sometimes believe they are stronger than some States  but that is not true  for they lack moral force and their fight  although violent  is a terminal and desperate one. Our country - and in particular our Government - is willing to wage an all-out war on all fronts against this scourge. We want to extend our law enforcement measures to reach all those involved in drug trafficking. We are providing the Colombian Government with all possible support. On this point  I should like my words to ring out with the full force of a call for shared and joint action. Despite the enormous limitations faced by my country  we have none the less donated three fighter  exploration and surveillance aircraft to our sister republic of Colombia.I wish now to address one of the major universal problems that affects particularly my country and our Latin American brothers. I refer to the prevailing international economic order. We are one of the countries whose volume of exports is affected by the exclusions or limitations imposed by a system of customs and tariff barriers  subsidies and other restrictions on free competition in the trade in agricultural products. This limitation coincides with demands for the payment of interest on our foreign debt. The industrialized countries which demand absolute respect for financial obligations are the very ones that are limiting our possibilities for recovery by restricting the access of our basic commodities to their markets. This means specifically that many Latin American countries are faced with a situation of having to mortgage their development or demand of their People an extremely high  indeed immoral  social cost  in order to meet their foreign debt obligations.Our Government is committed to meeting its obligations  but of course we require the necessary reciprocal changes in the conduct of international trade in order to make our effort economically viable so that we may be able to sell our products freely  at competitive and realistic prices. We are not so much afraid of the debt itself as of the persistence of a system that keeps on postponing the prospects of legitimate recovery.I will not go into detail about these inequities in the world economy. Many of the countries represented here experience it as terrible deprivations  and indeed  their very survival is threatened. This syndrome has been described very accurately. Data on the annual South-North flow of dollars make further comments unnecessary.What I do want to point out to the Assembly is that in Argentina's current crisis  which is similar in essence to that of many other Latin American countries  the determining factor is the deformation of our economy  coinciding with the perversion of world trade.In this respect  we are committed to a thoroughgoing reorganization  halting hyper-inflation  streamlining the State and replacing a ruinous economy riddled with financial speculation by what we call the ""productive revolution""  so that one who works in the productive chain may benefit.We realize that it would be inconsistent to call for a fair external order while maintaining injustice and disorder within our own borders. Therefore  our mandate began with a thorough restructuring of our own economic and financial organization. Within a few weeks we have managed to curb the hyper-inflationary process  to lower interest rates and contain the dollar parity. However  we are aware that this internal reorganization would only be a partial effort if not accompanied by economic change on a global scale  because at the world level also  at least in the sphere of the capitalist countries  we suffer from a disease  the privilege of the financial circles - and that of speculation - to the detriment of the fundamental element  productivity. Currency ceases to be a symbol of values and trade becomes the dominating factor of the economy.Confronted with this reality  our country is taking action at the regional level  from our immediate frontiers  to implement a policy of growing integration and co-operation with our Latin American brothers. Intensive work is being carried out to consolidate and integrate a system of trade  technological exchange and co-operation for production  based upon concrete agreements. Thus  the real content of this effort will be in the hands of businessmen and will not be only at the State level. We trust that in time this important initiative will become the corner-stone of this unity of peoples that is the natural destiny of Latin Americans. However  this task is not limited to our continent. We are trying to extend it to many other countries through trade and technological co-operation.I have tried to point to some of the central aspects of our position with regard to international problems. We firmly believe that the United Nations has before it a very important task to correct deviations and find the avenues we all desire. The Organization has a mandate  specified in Article 1  paragraph 3  is:""To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character ..."".This objective is broad and far from being achieved. None the less  we feel that more than ever it is the essential task of the United Nations to manage the major world problems to the benefit of all and not just at the discretion of a few  even though they are the most powerful.I repeat. There are not three worlds. There are no levels of mankind that can be ignored. There are no continents that can be left out. There is no individual salvation. The twenty-first century will by built by everyone in the world or the twenty-first century will be a mere illusion. It is essential to avoid any irreparable division of the world  a division that may no longer be political but rather economic.Our country  like the vast majority of developing countries  aspires to active co-operation with the industrialized countries which  in turn  are affected by the contradictions resulting from their technological growth. This attitude was made clear at the recent Belgrade Conference of Heads of State of the Non-Aligned Countries. There  constructive co-operation prevailed over confrontational impulses.To conclude  I wish to make an appeal  I should like my words to reach the conscience of all  to reach each heart  without distinction as to creed  dogma  political colours or national factions. I should like each of us to look the other in the eye and to ask ourselves sincerely and frankly? Is this the world our children deserve? Can we feel proud of the world our children will inherit tomorrow? Will we be satisfied when  in the near future  the voice of history and of our blood summons us to judgement?We cannot mortgage the present. We cannot kill our hope. We cannot murder our dreams. The twenty-first century is not merely a rhetorical turn of phrase. It is not a mere publicity slogan  nor is it a new technological goal. Fundamentally  the twenty-first century is represented in each and every one of c children and young people. The twenty-first century has the face and the look of millions and millions of children and youth  who  today  at this very moment  demand that we face our responsibilities with the intelligence and greatness needed to rule the destiny of the world. The twenty-first century must not be a century of war  anguish  death  hunger  alienation  collective madness  indifference  disease  backwardness or ignorance. Today poverty prevents a billion people from having a minimally acceptable standard of living. One out of five human beings suffers this terrible humiliation  in the last 24 hours - please listen to me - some 40 000 children under the age of five have died from causes related to poor economic conditions. Faced with that situation  we cannot look the other way and feign ignorance. The future cannot be measured in terms of material wealth or poverty alone. We must fight hunger among poor children  and we must also be concerned with the despair of rich children.In the poor countries  they cannot find the economic means for education  work or well-being  or for survival itself. In the industrialized countries  they feel threatened by education characterized by cruel competitiveness. They are denied the space and time they need for fantasy  and they are forced to enter a world where important values are not always kept alive. In both instances  the developed and under-developed  the young feel confronted by a ""closed world"". The twenty-first century cannot be the mere perpetuation of such a mirage.I insist we must ask ourselves a question deep within ourselves  a question that may seem cruel and compromising: can we truly feel happy with the universe we have created? Can we look our children and young people in the eye and tell them without hypocrisy that we are going to bequeath to them a world in which it is worthwhile to live? Can we say ""mission accomplished"" with a sigh of relief? Can we sleep peacefully while a single defenceless human being is dying from lack of food  medicine  education or love?I know the answer will not satisfy us  but because I know the answer will bring us together in our conscience  I wish to leave you with this final appeal. Children and young people are the best measure of our behaviour and our decisions. They must be the protagonists of a twenty-first century of hope  rather than becoming the victims of a new millennium of horror. That is why I take as mine the words of His Holiness Pope Paul VI  words that are an appeal and a commitment for all men of good will: ""Peace is obviously more than the absence of war. Peace is development; and without development peace is an illusion""."
"6",278,"ATG",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  I bring you the fraternal greetings of my people and our congratulations on your elevation to your high office. Your country  Nigeria  and mine have deep historical and cultural links which underscore the need for mutual support and co-operation. However  on account of your personal qualities and the vision which you bring to the presidency  you are assured of the unfailing support of my delegation.Permit me here to express my thanks to the former President  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the skilful manner in which he has directed our deliberations over the past year. His guidance was most encouraging and the results  I must add  most gratifying.I wish to offer my country's sincerest thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and to the organs of the United Nations for the support extended to Antigua and Barbuda in the wake of one of the most devastating hurricanes ever to have unleashed its fury upon the eastern Caribbean. The damage to my country was severe but the response of the international community reaffirms my faith and my people's faith in the effectiveness of the United Nations organs and in the goodwill of mankind.Fifty years ago the havoc  brutality and destructiveness of the Second World war was visited on mankind. The United Nations  be it remembered  was created at the end of the conflagration to promote peace  security  economic reconstruction and self-determination. Today the role of the United Nations is pivotal in the continued promotion of peace  in the stride towards economic development and in the reconstruction efforts of so many nations where the ability to function has beat impaired by disasters  man-made and natural.This year  as the people of Antigua and Barbuda struggle to overcome the devastation of a hurricane  the r a is on d'etre of the United Nations is made manifest. The Office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Co-ordinator and the United Nations Development Programme deserve high commendation for the support and pledges of continued assistance extended to my nation immediately following upon the consequential dangers of this natural disaster.Two very disquieting and unrelenting man-made dangers which alarm my country and menace the most powerful countries in this hemisphere are terrorism and the trafficking in narcotics. Both are grave causes of concern to the decision makers in my twin-is land country.It was less than one year ago that Mercenaries unsuccessfully attempted to invade the Republic of Maldives. That blatant act of terrorism is a threat to the sovereignty of all snail countries in every hemisphere and an unsuspecting drain on our limited resources. My country can ill afford to spend our scarce foreign currency earnings on acquisition of military hardware. The choice for us is whether to buy more tractors  or to bring telephones into a distant village  or to offer scholarships to deserving youth  or to repair secondary roads for our farmers to transport their goods to market  or to increase our promotional budget for attracting business and visitors to our shores. But this looming terrorist threat requires a diversion of those scarce resources to rifles and ammunition and military uniforms. It is a threat which causes us to look towards the United Nations for support. My country will join forces with a score of small countries to sponsor a draft resolution proposed by the Republic of Maldives requiring the creation of a type of United Nations peace-keeping force to come to the assistance of any small State when requested so to do by its legitimate authority in the face of a terrorist threat to its sovereignty.In my immediate region  the eastern Caribbean  eight nations  including my own  have formed a regional security force which offers greater protection than any single member State can provide on its own. But Antigua and Barbuda none the less endorses a broader approach as proposed by Jamaica in a pending united Nations draft resolution. The creation of a multilateral unit established under the aegis of the United Nations is most appealing. Such a unit would possess the ability to provide assistance in situations requiring intelligence and interdiction capabilities; both are currently beyond the wherewithal of the extant Caribbean regional security system. The mere willingness of many small countries and manyisland developing countries to lend their support to the concept evidences our increased faith in the United nationsOver the past two weeks every Head of State from the Americas who has addressed this body has expounded on the scourge of drug trafficking. The Presidents of the United States and of Colombia have noted that the threat to democracy posed by the drug cartels is real and present. The threat to my nation's sovereignty is not imagined. Wealthy and powerful drug barons  when driven from their castles in one nation  will look to less defensive States from which to continue their criminal activity. To forestall the prospect of elevation fro*5 transit points in the trafficking of drugs to distillation centres for the production of the substance our island countries intend to seek increased United Nations protection. For an industry which ranks second in economic activity only to the arms trade and whose profits exceed the global cost of debt-servicing  we are fighting a disaster more horrendous in its implications than an entire summer of hurricanes drug abuse eats away the very foundations of civilizations and cultures which generations passed have bequeathed to us. It turns its victims into unrecognisable creatures and destroys our youngsters as surely as no tempest can. The purveyors of this evil must be apprehended and punished. Small countries such as my own are conscious of the superior strength which the drug barons possess. Antigua and Barbuda will therefore be a co-sponsor of the draft resolution to be tabled by Trinidad and Tobago proposing the creation of an international criminal court of justice empowered with jurisdiction to bring to trial and to convict those dealers in death who have no nationality and for whom the sanctity of life has no meaning.The traffic in drugs and the threat of terrorism have the potential to undermine our sovereignty. But the harm to the environment  resulting in global warming  threatens the coastline of every country with flooding and our low-lying island nations with complete submersion.In March of this year we witnessed the convening of a summit meeting on the protection of the global atmosphere. The leaders of 24 countries adopted a common declaration addressed to all nations. The Hague Declaration emphasized that the environmental problem is world-wide and requires solutions devised on a global scale. The nature of the dangers involved necessitates the seeking of remedies to preserve the ecosystem and to enable humanity to live in dignity in a viable global environment. All States have an obligation both to our populations and to future generations. There is therefore need for regulatory  supportive and adjustment measures to take into account the participation and potential contribution of States which are at varying levels of development.Many developing countries contribute to the degradation as their burgeoning populations cut down forests to provide timber and to make land available for cattle ranching and agriculture  much as the developed countries have done for centuries. The grave nature of the resulting  looming crisis can be gleaned from computer projections which indicate that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a consequence of development could increase the earth's average temperature by 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit before the year 2050. Resulting weather patterns could make infertile large tracts of land now under food production  and oceans could rise by several feet to flood large areas of coastal land  thereby causing innocent  non-contributing island countries to disappear under the sea.There is undoubtedly an increased recognition in all countries of the gravity of the environmental problem and collectively there are specific measures which can be taken by the nations of the world to safeguard our planet. There should be the imposition of special taxes on carbon-dioxide emissions  which would serve to encourage conservation. Environmental review should become am integral part of lending procedures within countries so that local banks could be prevented from providing funds for projects that destroy habitats. Funding should be increased for research on alternative energy sources  including that of solar power  and safer designs for nuclear reactors. Financial assistance should be given to developing countries to enable us to construct high-efficiency power plants. And  although a number of other costly measures could be implemented  the simple act of establishing an international tree-planting programme is highly recommended.My country appreciates that the problem is most complex. Antigua and Barbuda accepts the view enunciated by the Commonwealth Secretary-General that ""the current work on greenhouse gases and global warming requires the combined skills of physicists  meteorologists  biologists  geographers  economists  lawyers  engineers ... To deal with such problems satisfactorily is a challenge to both statesmen and thinkers.""It is widely accented that all solutions require multilateral co-operation  we insist that the principle of multilateralism be applied  conscious of the fact that the mechanism of the United Nations mu3t again be called upon to provide technical leadership and support.Antigua and Barbuda also seeks the support of the United Nations community in promoting a new approach to measuring the economic well-being of island developing countries. We again reiterate that the use of conventional economic indicators to measure the economic standing of island developing countries is neither apt nor realistic.Conventional indicators distort our economic soundness  ignore the fragility of our economic base  and fail to compensate for the disproportionately high costs attached to providing routine services to small populations. The gross national product per capita is the major culprit. It does not take into account that tourism  the economic lifeline of many developing countries including my own  requires massive expenditures for promotion. The export of manufactured goods does not. Promotional spending takes place in the developed countries from which the tourists come  resulting in a continuous transfer of our hard-earned hard currency to developed countries. But this spending must take place. Promotion is the sine qua non of a successful tourist-based economy) 60 per cent of the gross domestic product off my country is generated by tourism. The gross national product per capita measuring device does not take that major fact into account; nor does it give an adequate representation off our country's governability. Last month a single hurricane destroyed in 12 hours the 50 years' work it took my Government to provide a functioning electricity delivery system. The damage to our homes  our schools  our single hospital  agricultural crops and  most particularly  our fishing industry exceeds in dollars the aggregate export earnings off five years.combined. The difficulties resulting from hurricane Hugo are compounded by economic constraints posed by our smallness  by an increasing disappearance of preferential markets  by a decline in official development assistance and by access restrictions to soft-loan financing. Island developing countries once again present our case for the use of more reliable economic indicators and for special assistance from the United Nations and its many organs.Over the past six sessions Antigua and Barbuda has been in the forefront on the question of Antarctica. Again we seek to remind this body that Antarctica is mankind's last frontier. Man's intrusion there  if not carefully monitored and regulated  can dramatically alter the global ocean currents and weather patterns. Antarctica is a meet significant regulator of the earth's weather systems; any change in the Antarctic environment can have a dire impact on the climate and environment of other parts of the earth.Last year we had much cause for regret when we learned of the decision of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to disregard totally and completely General Assembly resolution 42/45  of 30 November 1987  which called for a moratorium on negotiations to establish a minerals regime until all members of the international community are able to participate fully in such negotiations. This year we are greeted with a glimmer of hope as three of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have declared that they will not sign the minerals convention and are advocating instead the establishment off an Antarctic wilderness park. We welcome this development. Antigua and Barbuda continues to call for the direct involvement of the United Nations and the fullest co-operation of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties with the Secretary-General or his representative.Many recent developments in technology have brought about major changes in the domestic well-being of several developing countries. As the pace of technology quickens  assail developing countries seeking to keep pace experience a strain on their resources. My country is nevertheless determined to use the products of science and technology to realize its development goals. Our long-standing efforts to build and strengthen our endogenous capacity in science and technology have taken on a sense of urgency as we seek to improve social and economic conditions through expanded production  increased export earnings and international competitiveness. If we are to enhance the infrastructure of our learning institutions in the fields of science and technology  if we are to improve the management of science and technology  then my country must press the international community to increase the flow of technology to small countries on conditions acceptable to us.The islands of the Caribbean were once populated by an ancient  robust  sea-faring people: because of man's greed and viciousness  their populations were decimated to the point of near extinction. Relics of their civilization can be found throughout every Caribbean island. Antigua and Barbuda is thus compelled to raise its voice in calling for the protection of indigenous peoples in the modern world.We make this appeal in the knowledge that in this century ft ere have been more ethnocides  genocides and extinctions of distinct ethnic and tribal groups than in any other period of history. In 1988 more than 200 000 indigenous people around the world were murdered and more than 2 million were forced to flee their homelands.The violence manifested against indigenous peoples is in no sense random. The violence occurs  most frequently  when States or dominant groups attempt to exert complete control over ethnic or tribal minorities. Many indigenous people live in the more remote and least-explored areas of their countries. They have been pushed so far that they are making a final stand against aggression. But they fight  like the heroic Caribbean peoples of centuries past  against more formidable foes  to which they will most certainly succumb. Not many decades from now the fate of the world's remaining indigenous peoples could be decided once and for all. Antigua and Barbuda will readily give its support to the proposal by the Group for the Studies of Indigenous Populations - a part of the United Nations Sub-Committee for the Protection of Minorities - that 1992 be declared the international year of the indigenous peoples of the world.Africa's struggle for total liberation will come only with the eradication of apartheid. We are convinced that the oppressed majority of South Africa - the black people of South Africa - will soon win its freedom  with the unfailing support of the United Nations. This year the General Assembly will again devote a special session to apartheid. But we are certain that the racist Pretoria regime will completely ignore the resolutions which are likely to emerge since it has  with impunity  ignored those which were adopted last year. South Africa must be compelled to lift all state-of-emergency regulations  end its ban on all political organisations  restore free speech and movement  and commence a dialogue with the representatives of the majority population. My country reiterates its call for the adoption of mandatory sanctions of a comprehensive nature against the racist regime as a means to compel it to comply. Antigua and Barbuda calls once again for the release of Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners and seeks the cessation of the harassment of Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Reverend Alan Boesak.Antigua and Barbuda condemns the racist South Africans for creating impediments to an independent Namibia. The States Members of the United Nations cannot become complacent; we must not allow South Africa to jettison the agreements readied through our efforts here. If we fail to deter South Africa we shall disappoint the world  which is watching us  eager to see Namibia take its rightful seat as the one hundred sixtieth State Member of the United Nations. The men and women of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG)  international civil servants who are on site in Namibia  have placed their lives in jeopardy; several nationals of my small country are serving in Namibia under UNTAG. The Assembly must ensure that they do not labour in vain  that South Africa complies with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We cannot allow the effort to end in failure.Continuing on the subject of the African continent  we turn now to Western Sahara. Antigua and Barbuda actively supports the peace plan of the United Nations Secretary-Genera' and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. We lend our support to the people of Western Sahara in their struggle for self-determination and endorse all international efforts aimed at securing peace and stability in the Maghreb region.Permit me to focus upon my own region briefly. Antigua and Barbuda applauds the developments in Central America  which are certain to bring peace. We endorse Security Council resolution 637 (1989)  which relates to the Esquipulas II agreements. We adhere to our earlier statements that economic injustice is tineroot cause of many of the Local conflicts there; these conflicts were exacerbated by the cold war. The number of proxy wars  though  is fast diminishing  and we welcome the demobilization and repatriation of irregular forces. poor nations with bare material storehouses can ill afford the squandering of scarce resources brought on by wars. The strengthening of democracy in the region will continue if peace lasts; economic reform must also be instituted in order to guarantee peace. The people of Central America  and especially the people of Panama  are assured that our hearts are with them in this era of extreme difficulty; it is our sincere hope that their many crises will soon be resolved.Further a field  we are discouraged by developments in Afghanistan. Despite the Agreement on the Settlement of the Situation relating to Afghanistan  and despite the unanimous adoption of resolution 43/20 of 3 November 1988  the suffering of the sturdy Afghan people continues. My country reiterates its support to that people's struggle to achieve self-determination and total autonomy.In Lebanon  the people must be allowed to settle their differences without undue interference. My country stands ready to endorse any proposal that will lead to full Lebanese sovereignty over the entire country and guarantee the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanese soil.The entire Middle East conflict continues to have the propensity for generating repercussions in a far wider sphere. The decisions taken by the Palestine National Council at Algiers in November 1988 and at Geneva the following month created a diplomatic momentum which has since been supplanted by mistrust and doubt. It is imperative that there be an international peace conference. The interests of all concerned are best served through dialogue and negotiations in an atmosphere propitious to peaceful resolution. The United Nations must continue itsquest to find a letting settlement  premised on the rights of all States and peoples in that region to exist within recognized and secure borders.In South-East Asia  two Koreas seem permanent. The Republic of Korea has repeatedly expressed its desire to become a Member of the United Nations. Antigua and Barbuda can find no logical cause or explanation for denying it membership; further  we consider it unjust that it is barred from membership for reasons other than those stipulated in the United Nations Charter.Last year at this time we were encouraged by developments relating to Cambodia. Unfortunately  the Conference convened in Paris at the initiative of the Government of France fell short of getting a direct commitment from the various factions. But it succeeded in working out significant elements of a comprehensive settlement and in identifying necessary aspects of a solution. It is hoped that there will be no slackening of efforts to bring about peace and justice in Kampuchea.In Cyprus  the fact that the leaders of the two sides involved in that conflict have committed themselves to achieving an overall settlement augurs well for the future. We are heartened by our Secretary-General's announcement that a critical juncture has now been reached. Antigua and Barbuda consequently gives its full support to the effort and urges the two parties to reach an acceptable solution within the year.Like snail countries Antigua and Barbuda looks increasingly to international law for protection  and we are keenly aware of the role of the United Nations in promoting respect for law. The lawless dumping of hazardous wastes in developing countries requires immediate United Nations action. It is unfair and unthinkable to burden with the by-products of affluent societies those that are endeavouring to keep their fragile ecosystems safe for this and future generations. It would be suicidal to accept the wastes of industrial societies in the Caribbean given the complete reliance of our peoples on every square mile of our land and sea. Antigua and Barbuda calls for a strict international regime to protect all developing countries from becoming dumping-grounds for hazardous wastes.My delegation's request for United Nations assistance and support in our hurricane recovery efforts  in the establishment of a multilateral force  in the creation of an international court of criminal justice in the provision of leadership and support on environmental issues  and a few other natters catalogued earlier  might appear to suggest that my small island developing country and maybe other small countries are willing to surrender  or to trade in  elements of our sovereignty for greater security and improved conditions. My country guards its sovereignty jealously. Antigua and Barbuda will remain a free and fully independent country just as long as the nation-State system survives. My Prime Minister  the Right Honourable Doctor Vere Cornwall Bird  has for 50 years been in the forefront of the struggle to win our independence  to improve our standard of living and to foster in us pride in our heritage. He continues to pass on to us a legacy which we shall never abandon. Antigua and Barbuda will do all in its power to ensure our continued development  to ensure lasting peace  and to secure humanity's survival through  multilatra1 efforts. However  we are willing to part with no more of our sovereignty than is the most powerful country in any hemisphere."
"7",325,"AUS",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me to begin by warmly congratulating the President on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. He brings to his role a wealth of experience at the United Nations and  as a former Foreign Minister  in international affairs generally. The ties between Australia and Nigeria date from the very inception of Nigeria's nationhood and have always been close aid productive. I look forward to close personal co-operation with him during my presence here  and to a rewarding General Assembly under his leadership.This year we mark the fiftieth anniversary of the start of the Second World War  a war which took more lives  and visited more devastation  than any conflict in human history. The end of that war aid the beginning of the United Nations were closely linked. The founding and sustaining inspiration of this Organization has been a vision of world peace  achieved end sustained through international co-operation.It is an appropriate time now to reflect on how that vision has fared  to look back on what has been achieved  to see what more can be achieved  and to ask what more needs to be done to maximise the United Nations role in maintaining international peace and security. So it is on these themes - on the United Nations role in peace-making  peace-keeping and disarmament - that I want to focus this Australian contribution to the general debate. It is a contribution made against the background of Australia's position as a founding Member of the United Nations  a nation which has always seen the United Nations as a means of giving small aid middle-sized countries a significant say in international issues and a nation which has  over the years  sought to make a constructive contribution to the United Nations efforts in all three areas of peace-making  peace-keeping and disarmament. The political will of the international community to empower the United Nations with the capacity to fulfil the role its founders envisaged has ebbed and flowed in the years since the San Francisco Conference drafted the United Nations Charter. For much of this period  as we all know too well  the cold war cast a long shadow over the work of the Organization. It worked to hamstring the operation of the Security Council  weaken the capacity of the United Nations to deal with regional conflicts  and inject an East-West dimension into virtually every area of the Organization's operations.But now  by contrast  the thaw that has occurred in the climate of East-West relations in recent years has had a profoundly positive effect on the work of the United Nations. It has cleared the way for United Nations involvement in a record number of peace-keeping operations. It has changed the whole tone of debate in this Hall in a way that makes it easier to arrive at constructive and practical outcomes. And it has  for the first time in many years  opened the door to serious discussion about how to strengthen the peace-making and peace-keeping role of the United Nations.The primary aim of our Organization remains the maintenance of international peace and security  and there is no doubt that the United Nations can play a hugely important role in peace-making and the avoidance and resolution of international conflict:In so far as conflict is caused by ignorance of the factual situation or of the motives of rival Sates  or by mutual misunderstanding  the United Nations can act to bring the parties to a common appreciation of the facts and of each other's intentions.In so far as conflict is caused by angry and emotional reaction to specific problems  the United Nations can act through discussion and delay to institute a cooling-off period until such problems can be approached through peaceful means. In so far as conflict is caused by a lack of imagination in finding original solutions to difficult bilateral problems  the United Nations as an outside party may be able to identify pacific outcomes that the parties directly aid intimately involved cannot see unaided.In so far as conflict is caused by the ambition of individual leaders  United Nations peace-making can utilize the spotlight of global public opinion to press for more reasonable attitudes.In so far as conflicts are perpetuated by the unwillingness of the parties to back down and make concessions to one another  United Nations peacemakers can be impartial third parties to whom concessions can more easily be made.And in so far as conflict is created by irreconcilable national interests  the United Nations can at least interpose itself between the parties until such time as those differences do not have the sort of priority that impels nations towards armed conflict  or until longer-term solutions are found.The Charter assigns the main responsibility for maintaining international peace and security to the Security Council. Despite its structural and procedural shortcomings the Security Council remains the lynchpin of the United Nations in terms of the Organization's peace-making and peace-keeping functions. In empowering the Secretary-General to bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which may threaten peace  the Charter's intention was not so much to have the United Nations deal with conflicts once they had broken out as to stop tensions developing into hostilities; its role was essentially preventive. From that evolved the f motion of good offices  which both the Security Council and the Secretary-General have been called upon to exercise in discharging their duties.For many years  as we again all know  the Security Council has had at best a mixed record in discharging those functions. But the dark days  when action by the Security Council was impeded by political point-scoring or capricious use of the veto  appear to be coming to an end aid being replaced by the Council's use foe a genuine search for solutions to international problems. Certainly  we welcome the more responsive aid responsible recognition by permanent members of the need for decisive steps to make and keep the peace. But it is now timely for us to look more positively end energetically at ways in WHICH the role of the Security Council in averting threats to peace - averting  If you like  our global political environment - can best be strengthened.Undoubtedly the greatest scope for enhancing the Council's effectiveness lies in improving Its ability to take pre-emptive international action to stop disputes developing into hostilities  for peace-making to be effective  both the Council and the Secretary-General need up-to-date  comprehensive and reliable information on which to base assessments and make recommendations. In his 1989 report on the work of the Organization  Mr. Perez de Cuellar has drawn attention to the problems encountered by the Secretariat in ensuring that it is adequately briefed and prepared to deal with incipient breaches of the peace.Australia wholeheartedly endorses the Secretary-Generalâs observations. Prom the outset of the United Nations we have argued that the Secretary-General of the Organization should be encouraged to play a bold part in all the work of this body aid to take a large measure of initiative. In the Security Council In 1985 ray predecessor  Mr. Hayden  indicated Australia 's strong support for proposals that the Secretary-General be more extensively involved as mediator  arbitrator  negotiator or catalyst in seeking solutions to international problems that threaten to disturb the peace. That Is a role that was developed first by Dag Hammarskjold in the context of a period of rigid super-Power hostility. Ironically  the new era of co-operation can bring it to full fruition.In this Improved International climate we should be willing and able to make major new efforts to Improve the flow of information to the Secretariat and the Security Council. Australia has already assisted the Secretary-General in this respect  but we consider the time has now come for more formal methods of communication. The idea that we would support  already widely canvassed  is that the Security Council should hold periodic meetings at foreign minister level  in closed session  to exchange information and views on those events and developments which could escalate into conflict. There seems to be no dissent as to the usefulness of that idea. Perhaps the first such meeting could take place immediately after this session of the General Assembly.Despite some inherent limitations in the Secretary-General's capacity to act  Mr. Perez de Cuellar has shown through his own personal initiative and courage a determination to pursue the cause of peace. His energetic diplomacy in seeking an end to the divisions and conflicts in Cyprus and Afghanistan  for example  demonstrate the scope for the Secretary-General's good-offices role  aid we welcome this timely development. But in recognizing and respecting Mr. Perez de Cuellar's endeavours it is no less important for the General Assembly to recognize the contribution it can make to resolving disputes. Frustrated as we all sometimes are by repetitious debates and resolutions  we must try to imagine how much worse off the Organization would be if it lacked this representative forum  bringing together as it does not only the great Powers but the medium-sized and small States to exchange information  concerns and experience. It is in this Assembly that the nations of the world ate best able to develop  through their collective expressions of will  appropriate norms of international behaviour against which the actions of individual States might be judged.The weight of international opinion  as reflected in our debates and resolutions  should not be underestimated. The Australian delegation to the San Francisco Conference of 1945 considered that the General Assembly should have the widest possible powers of discussion and recommendation so that the pressure of world public opinion could be brought to bear upon countries not living up to their international obligations. By the same token  Australia has consistently taken the position that the General Assembly should avoid exacerbating differences and hindering the peace-making process by manifestly provocative resolutions such as that equating Zionism with racism. The General Assembly is at its best and acting truest to the founding spirit of the United Nations when it is acting constructively  seeking solutions to problems and pointing to practical ways forward.If I may shift the focus now from peace-making to peace-keeping  it is clear that with the renewed confidence now felt by the international community in the opportunities for collective action to keep the peace  the demands on the United Nations machinery have grown greater and have in turn created their own urgent problems for the Organization. The Secretary-General has himself drawn attention to some of the important implications for the United Nations of these both promising and challenging developments. Most recently  the United Nations experience with the peace-keeping operation in âÑ1Ð¬1Ð° has illustrated the consequences of paying insufficient regard to the prerequisites for efficiently carrying out the Security Council's decisions. As a result of problems in resolving funding and related logistical questions  valuable time was lost in deploying the peace-keeping forces in Namibia  and the success of that operation was potentially compromised. We should not allow such a situation to happen again. The obstacles encountered on this occasion can and must be avoided.It is obvious that a successful United Nations peace-keeping operation requires prior agreement by consensus on its mandate  precise arrangements for its funding  and adequate prior planning for its deployment. Those pre-conditions are all the more imperative because of the expanding role being accorded peace-keeping operations and the renewed interest being shown by Member States in taking part in these exercises. If the international community is to make effective and constructive contributions to keeping the peace and forging long-term solutions to conflicts  greater resources must be put at the disposal of the Secretary-General and the Security Council.It is essential  in the first place that we overcome the difficulties and delays associated with inadequate arrangements for the financing of peace-keeping operations. In part  their inadequacy arises from the failure of Member States in the past to pay their contributions in full and on time. The Secretary-General has mentioned in his report that one possibility for the future would be the establishment of a special reserve fund for peace-keeping  and this idea should certainly be further elaborated. In the interim  however  it would appear that an increase in the working capital fund by 3100 million would go a long way towards overcoming current problems. That  perhaps along with some form of special fund  would ensure that operations do not founder for lack of reserves at an early stage. The United Nations needs to have in place not only access to funds but also structures and machinery that can spring readily into action. It cannot afford to re-invent the peace-keeping wheel each time the Organization is called on to exert its peace-keeping mandate.Australia stands ready to help in all those respects. We have participated in most of the United Nations peace-keeping operations  and have been a member of the Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations since its inception. To contribute to the Organization's capacity to respond to situations requiring peace-keeping services  we would be willing  among other things  to make available to the United Nations the services of a senior Australian army officer to join the military planning staff.More  of course  is required than ad hoc individual arrangements of that kind. The renaissance of peace-keeping operations has resulted in a vast increase in the number of countries contributing to operations. In the last year  this number has jumped from 23 to 47  and I understand that another 47 countries are looking to participate. The reality is that the sheer number of operations under way or imminent places a large burden on the very competent members of the Secretariat responsible for co-ordinating and planning operations. Member States should acknowledge that it is now time to increase the number of personnel working on these matters  and to ensure that the Secretary-General is in a position to recruit persons of the highest calibre to the task. Australia would also support a review of the structure of the United Nations Secretariat to look at the desirability of bringing all peace-keeping activities under a single division of the Secretariat.Peace-keeping arrangements have to be not only planned on a professional basis but also effectively implemented at the operational level. There is a very basic but still very important need to institute on a much more formal and regularized basis the training of new members of peace-keeping operations  both in the principles that underline such operations and in the procedures that must be followed.More training seminars at the regional  national  and international levels are required. An international training centre could be set up directly under the auspices of the United Nations  if that is seen as the most economic and effective way to undertake the task. In any event  training in peace-keeping activities along lines recommended by the United Nations itself could  with advantage  become a component of the regular training given by countries to their national armies.Equally  in order to facilitate the expeditious and most effective use of troops  Australia would support States designating military units and observers that could be called upon at short notice and undergo appropriate training in advance. To the same end  we would support the establishment of a stockpile of essential supplies  such as transport and communication equipment  that would also be readily available at short notice for new and urgent tasks to which the United Nations becomes committed.Australia also sees value in exploring  perhaps by means of a study  the possible application of modern technology to peace-keeping operations. While aware of the complexities and sensitivities that  for example  satellite monitoring would entail  an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages would be a useful next step.In both planning and Implementing peace-keeping operations  there is a general need  particularly with so many new personnel-contributing countries entering the arena  to tap mote systematically the experience of those countries which have played that role before. Here as elsewhere  better commutation and co-operation will help avoid wasteful repetition and duplication of effort. Consideration of all those steps will take on renewed urgency if and when the United Nations is called upon to sponsor  as Australia believes it should be  an international control mechanism as part of a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia. It is a sign of the times that what is being proposed here is not a traditional peace-keeping force as such  but a mechanism for supervising  monitoring  and verifying  among other things  a cease-fire  the withdrawal of foreign forces  a cessation of external arms supplies  measures of disarmament  release and exchange of prisoners of war  the holding of democratic elections  and assisting with the maintenance of law and order.We are gratified that the United Nations Secretariat has taken particular care to prepare itself well in advance for that possible undertaking. Australia was pleased to be able to join the Secretary-General's fact-finding mission to Cambodia  in the context of the Paris Conference on Cambodia  to look at the logistical problems an international control mechanism would face. We see that both as a very useful exploratory exercise in its own right and as a helpful precedent to have created for such planning action in the future.Peace-keeping is not and should not be an end in itself but a means for establishing the right circumstances in which to advance the cause of peace. But  as some of the more persistent international trouble-spots demonstrate  the customary processes of easing tensions and putting in place the machinery for their indefinite resolution are not sufficient to guarantee global security. What is required is a commitment not only to renouncing the use of force to settle disputes but also to working towards general and complete disarmament.Disarmament and arms control are not matters exclusively for the great Powers. The super-Powers  for obvious reasons  bear a special responsibility to make real progress towards the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  and in this respect we welcome the very encouraging outcome  covering several arms control issues  of the most recent meetings between the Soviet Union and the United States.The rest of the international community  however  cannot afford to sit back and await agreements between the major military Powers. There is also a role for multilateral disarmament efforts that involve the middle and small Powers. Indeed  there are some arms control issues that can only be dealt with effectively through multilateral negotiations.Foremost among them is the abolition of chemical weapons. For 20 years  concerned Governments have been labouring under United Nations auspices in Geneva to produce an international agreement banning the production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons  weapons which inflict untold misery and suffering on combat forces and civilians alike.It was in order to give impetus to those negotiations that just two weeks ago Australia  which has long been active in the United Nations and elsewhere on the chemical weapons issue  hosted the Government Industry Conference against Chemical Weapons  attended by senior officials from 66 Governments together with representatives of 95 per cent of the world's chemical industry. The Paris Conference on chemical weapons in January this year demonstrated that the international community is politically committed to concluding at the earliest date a comprehensive chemical weapons convention. The significance of the recent Canberra Conference  bringing together as it did on a major scale representatives of government and industry  is that it demonstrated that political will is now accompanied by the necessary practical will - a practical will to bring the talking to a close  a practical will to put into effect  sooner rather than later  a convention that will be workable and effective in the real modern industrial world.At Canberra  for the first time the world's chemical industry collectively signalled its unequivocal commitment to assist Governments to conclude a chemical-weapons ban. Industry also agreed to establish a formal International Industry Forum - representing chemical industries from all major blocs and sectors  not just the developed countries - to address the remaining practical issues to be resolved in the negotiation and implementation of a practical  verifiable  chemical-weapons convention.The Canberra Conference identified a number of interim steps that could be taken prior to the conclusion of a convention - and which indeed in some countries were already being taken - steps both to build confidence in the possibility of a successful convention and to build the working arrangements that would be needed to put that convention into operation. There was general agreement at the Canberra Conference not only that 1990 would be a critical year for the negotiations  but that it should be possible to negotiate substantive outstanding issues to resolution within that time-frame.We believe that it is a reasonable hope  and expectation  that as a result of all the developments in chemical weapons diplomacy this year  aid in particular with the momentum new generated by the Canberra Conference  the international community will get a better chemical-weapons convention  aid get it sooner than might otherwise have been the case. Already there have been further very positive signs that this momentum will be maintained. The statements made from this rostrum in the last week by President Bush and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze  following as they did the agreement a few days earlier between the United States and the Soviet Union on the exchange of data and other confidence-building measures  were very welcome. These developments are important not only in their own right  but because they indicate that the dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union on chemical weapons is keeping pace with multilateral negotiations  that both major Powers are now firmly committed to advancing the Geneva negotiations  and that they will help ensure that those multilateral negotiations conclude successfully and soon.Nuclear disarmament  through progressive  stabilizing reductions in the existing arsenals  remains a high priority. This is properly recognized as an imperative in its own right. But it is also closely related to another vital objective; preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. Australia remains a dedicated supporter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the single most effective and widely supported international arms control agreement in existence. We share with the overwhelming majority of United Nations Members the conviction that the world would be a very much more dangerous place without that Treaty and the standards of international behaviour it sets.Preparations have begun for the Fourth Review Conference of the Treaty next year. Australia is actively participating with other parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty in this important process  with the aim of further strengthening the Treaty to meet the proliferation challenges of the 1990s. Such challenges are emerging strongly in a number of regions. The Treaty's effectiveness would be increased by still wider membership and we appeal again to those States which have not already become parties to do so as a matter of priority. A ban on nuclear testing also occupies a central place in the quest for disarmament. We welcome the progress being made in the bilateral super-Power negotiations on nuclear testing and the developments on a number of fronts on the key issue of verification. What is clearly lacking  however  in the Conference on Disarmament - the body that has the relevant ability add authority - is the consensus to establish an ad hoc committee to put in place systematically the building blocks for an effectively verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty. Australia is firmly committed to the early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and we shall again sponsor a draft resolution urging the member States of the Conference on Disarmament to meet their responsibilities in this regard.Efforts at the global level ate important in securing the objectives of peace and disarmament. But constructive and balanced endeavours at the regional level can also make an important contribution. Representatives will be aware of the action that the countries of the South Pacific took in 19B5 to conclude the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty  which has now  just in this last year  been ratified and taken effect. That Treaty is not only consistent with the Charter of the United Nations  d the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty  but gives important witness to the aspirations of a region which  while it may be remote from most of the world's present centres of conflict  is no less deeply committed to the cause of world peace.The founders of the United Nations recognized that lasting security required more than even the prevention of wars and the reduction of armaments that true security was multidimensional in character  resting ultimately on improving the quality of life of all the peoples of the world. Our founders understood that military and economic and personal security were indivisible and that the origins of many conflicts lay in economic hardships and the denial of basic human rights. These issues still rightly loom very large in the work of the United Nations system  and  if anything  have increased in their international significance. 'We the peoples of the United Nations"" - to quote the opening lines of the United Nations Chatter - are today bound together in many complex ways. We face common problems which can be solved only by common efforts. The United Nations  if it is to remain a relevant institution  must be closely involved in all these efforts. It has a role to play in co-ordinating  aid in some cases leading  international efforts against threats to the environment  such as the depletion of the ozone layer  and other phenomena that put our common habitat at risk. The United Nations has a role to play in encouraging dialogue and practical action on the many pressing economic problems faced by so many countries  especially those of debt  poverty  and other barriers to trade and economic growth. The world simply cannot be regarded as free from the sources of tension which lead to international conflict until the problems of poverty and gross economic inequality are overcome. The United Nations has a role to play in combating terrorism aid in the fight against drug trafficking  which today pose threats to the very fabric of some of our communities. It has a crucial role to play in the whole range of humanitarian endeavours - from promoting fundamental human rights and freedoms  to caring for refugees and eradicating life-threatening epidemics - where so much has already been achieved  but so much remains to be done.The General Assembly will debate all those aid other matters of major international concern  demonstrating the unchanging validity and vitality of the Organization  and in so debating the issues it will have the unequivocal support of my country. Mr. Herbert V. Evatt  who was President of the third session of the General Assembly back in 1948  summed up Australia's view of the United Nations in the following memorable terms over 40 years ago. The United Nations  he said:""... is the best presently available instrument both for avoiding the supreme end ultimate catastrophe of a third world war  waged with all-destroying weapons  and also for establishing an international order which should and can assure to mankind security against poverty  unemployment  ignorance  famine and disease"".That vision of an active and effective United Nations was shared by all our founding forebears  and the onus on all of us now is to keep faith with that vision. "
"8",372,"AUT",44,1989,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure  Sir  that I congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this General Assembly. This is an expression of esteem for you as well as for the Federal Republic of Nigeria  a country which has assumed a significant role in regional and international affairs. May I wish you every success in carrying out your important task.I also wish to convey our sincere appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina  for the skilful leadership of our deliberations during the forty-third session of the General Assembly. Permit me to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his sacrificing and tireless service to the community of nations. The progress achieved towards peaceful solutions to many of the regional issues testifies to the manifold efforts and accomplishments of the Secretary-General and his dedicated staff.This is once more an age of profound changes. Never before in history has our civilization faced such challenges. During the past 100 years the society of nations has moved from international relations to international cooperation  to ever more international administration and management. A system originally based on the use of force has become increasingly characterized by the use of diplomacy  with an ever-more-important role for international law.In fact  the changes in the role of law in international relations have been impressive. Originally limited to regulating how and when to use force for Pursuing a country's legitimate claims  it has increasingly introduced other and more peaceful means of settling international conflicts. Three and a half centuries after Hugo Grotius  the famous Dutch philosopher  founded the modern concept of international law  the United Nations Charter now outlaws the use of military force in international relations.However  the use of force has not remained the exclusive domain of States. Today  the international community must therefore strengthen its efforts to combat new forms of violence such as terrorism. The adoption of conventions against terrorism by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO  and the international Maritime Organization (IMO) as well as the various general assembly and Security Council resolutions  are steps in the right direction.International law has reacted to the steadily advancing weapons technology  for instance by outlawing certain categories of weapons or by reducing the availability of particularly harmful arms. We fully support initiatives related to the limitation or prohibition of nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons. The fundamentally positive changes in East-West relations  as reflected in the recent talks between President Bush  Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze  give rise to expectations that disarmament diplomacy has entered a new phase  a phase in which further concrete results are within reach.Accepting the supremacy of law in international relations must lead also to the strengthening of international judiciary bodies. The attention of the members of the international community must therefore be focused on the possibilities for dispute settlement offered by the International Court of Justice and the need for States to accept its compulsory jurisdiction. International peace and security  the most noble aim of the Charter  cannot be achieved if internal peace in Member States is in jeopardy. Wherever basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are denied to the individual human being  peace is in danger.All endeavours to strengthen the role of international law with regard to human rights rely on the recognition of the principle that human rights are obligations under international law  a principle that can now be considered as universally recognized. Today  therefore  no State can any longer claim that international concern regarding its human rights situation is an interference in internal affairs.On the basis of that principle an important step has been taken within the European framework by including further humanitarian commitments in the Vienna Concluding Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The adoption of the so-called mechanism of the human dimension of the C5CS might be regarded as the starting point for an all-European system for the promotion of human rights. However  the deteriorating situation of ethnic and religious minorities in certain European States since the adoption of the Vienna Concluding document clearly shows the wide gap between commitments and realities in this field  as history has amply demonstrated  citizens will identify with their Governments only to the extent that basic rights and freedoms are guaranteed.May I suggest that the competent United Nations bodies study the relevant CSCE procedures with a view to their possible application on a universal level. I also wish to appeal to the Government of Romania fully to apply the mechanism in the field of human rights provided by the Vienna Concluding Document. The Paris meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE in May of this yearoffered a welcome opportunity to review progress regarding the implementation by the participating States of their human rights commitments. On that occasion I made reference  inter alia  to the question of the Islamic community in Bulgaria. Let me express the hope that a negotiated solution of that problem can be found in the near future.We wholeheartedly welcome the emphasis placed on human rights and fundamental freedoms by the members of the Non-Aligned Movement at their recent summit conference in Belgrade.A new and significant field of international law relates to regional and global environmental resource systems  such as international river basins  the oceans  outer space  the polar regions and the atmosphere. Regulating the use and preservation of the global commons has widened the scope of international law in an unprecedented way. Our generation becomes accountable to future generations for this common heritage.The report of the World Commission on Environment and Development provides us with an excellent conceptual framework in this regard both for national policies and for future work on the international level. We are convinced that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in 1992 must be based on the concept of sustainable development that has been elaborated in the report. Austria is faced with the problems of a precarious Alpine environment. Austrians have therefore developed a relatively high degree of environmental awareness reflected in the high standard of Austria's environmental legislation.Hence it is only natural that Austria actively participates in international co-operation on environment  hosting international conferences on such important issues as climatic changes  the use of tropical forests and the protection of the ozone layer. The latter Conference has led to the respective Vienna Convention. We are prepared to play a similarly active role in the elaboration of an international convention on climatic change.We also fully share the concerns of many with regard to the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal. The Basel Convention adopted earlier this year will be an important instrument for protecting human health and environment.There can be little doubt that the current International institutional framework for environment decision-making and enforcement mechanisms requires strengthening. Austria therefore strongly supports all efforts aimed at reinforcing such existing UN structures as the UN environment programme. We believe that the Hague declaration will give strong impetus to internal endeavours in this direction. New legal instruments with regional and global scope may be required. We should review the possibility of drawing up an international environment charter that would set clear guidelines for action.  As the economic use of transnational environmental system becomes more competitive  appropriate procedures for dispute settlement will become indispensable. Just as we have become accustomed to Blue Helmets  which have become so useful in peace-keeping  we may express the firm hope that  in the foreseeable future  United Nations ""Green Helmets"" may engage in the protection of the environment.Solving regional conflict  is a priority task for the community of nations. We are very pleased to see how the United Nations has effectively contributed to peace-making and peacekeeping over the years.  In this context  we pay special tribute to the Secretary-General and to the members of the Security Council  where timely decisions on appropriate measures have been taken. They have greatly facilitated the progress made during the past year.At the same time  international peace-building efforts through programmes of reconstruction  humanitarian aid and decent cooperation are rightly considered a elementary element to the settles of conflicts  such as ""operation Life-line"" in Sudan. Austria has a long tradition of actively supporting the United Nations in its peace-keeping efforts. More than 28 000  Austrians  roughly every eighth Austrian soldier  have served with United Nations peace-keeping forces during the past30 years. Austria currently participates in seven of the ten United Nations peace-keeping operations.On the basis of our long-term experience in peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts we know that every issue has to be settled on the specific merits and conditions of each region.  Nevertheless  we believe that the progress achieved in confidence- and security-building measures within  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) may also be of interest to other regions.  Austria is prepared to organize  in co-operation with the United Nations  an international seminar on this  subject for which it will also draw on the experience of experts from participating States of the CSCE  process. Such a seminar could be held in Austria in 1991.The crisis in Lebanon. with its tragic consequences of continuing bloodshed and victimization of innocent individuals and the civilian population  is a matter of outmost concern to us. We firmly believe that a lasting solution can only he found on the basis of respect for the national unity  territorial integrity and full independence of Lebanon. We support the peace plan of the Tripartite High Arab Committee and welcome the results so far achieved. Let me express the hope that this agreement will pave the way at last for a final peaceful settlement.With regard to the Arab-Israeli conflict  we continue to support the idea of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties to the conflict  including the Palestinian people. That conference would be the most appropriate instrument for a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. We regret any escalation of violence. The excessive use of force and the continued violations of human rights in the occupied territories have become increasingly intolerable for the international community  which strives more and more for universal respect of human rights. We welcome the recent peace proposal of President Mubarak of Egypt and firmly hope his initiative will be successful. The process towards Namibia's independence for which the UN has accepted special responsibility  together with the UN peace-keeping efforts in areas which have been prey to conflict and bloodshed  exemplify the major role of the UN in settlement of highly sensitive international issues. This process could be a source of inspiration in the search for solution to the Middle east problem. Independence for Namibia in on its way. Special care and vigilance will be necessary to assure that elections in November can take place in an atmosphere and under conditions which will allow for a plebiscite free from intimidation.  Austria has provided a contingent of police officers to participate in the work of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). UNTAG deserves our full appreciation of its accomplishes under most difficult conditions. We look forward to welcoming Namibia as an independent nation at next year's session of the General Assembly.The recent elections in South Africa without the participation of the black majority have shown one more that the inhumane system of apartheid must be abolished  we hope that the new South African President will undertake the necessary steps without further delay  it is to be emphasized  however  that all steps taken by South Africa must lead to the complete eradication of apartheid  avoiding bloodshed and confrontation.Austria's position with regard to Cambodia has remained unchanged over the years. We have always condemned the abhorrent violation of the most fundamental human rights  but we have also repeatedly stressed that military interventions cannot resolve conflicts. The withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops  which is presently under way  will significantly enhance the chances for a settlement. We regret that the endeavours towards reaching a negotiated solution  including the most recent Paris Conference  so far remain without concrete results.Having recently been entrusted with the presidency of the International Conference on Kampuchea  I shall spare no effort to contribute to the peace process in the region. I look forward to the moment when all Cambodians  in full sovereignty and independence  can open a new chapter in their nation's history.As in Cambodia  in Afghanistan the ongoing hostilities have brought immense suffering upon the population. We strongly support the endeavours of the Secretary-General to initiate a peaceful settlement and the necessary international co-operation for the recovery of that war-torn country.  In line with our traditional commitment to the principle of universality  Austria has always welcomed the admission of sovereign countries to the world organisation. It is only logical  therefore  that we also support the aspirations of Korea to become a UN member. We are impressed by the efforts of the Central American nations to cope with their regional difficulties. In particular  we welcome the results of the Tela summit  which constitute a concrete step. The linkage between the effective employment of regional responsibilities and of the authority of the UN may become an exemplary case of regional peace-making. The continued imbalances in the world economy remain a source of world-wide Preoccupation. Austria is committed to far-reaching trade liberalization because it believes that this will contribute to stable growth and prosperity among nations. We consider that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round could mark the beginning of a new era of global cooperation with increased awareness of mutual interest and shared responsibilities among all nations.The problems connected with the debt burden figure prominently on the international agenda. Their repercussions on the political and social stability of many debtor countries have now become even more visible. Extreme poverty and hunger remain rampant in many countries and regions  in the long term they have to be considered as a serious threat to peace and security.The international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade must respond to these issues  which are at the centre of our development efforts.While the interrelationship between economic and social development has to be adequately taken into account  a more thorough look at the world social condition  particularly in developing countries  has become necessary.Drug abuse is not only a social problem. It also affects the political and economic stability of nations. This is corroborated by the fact that the annual turn-over of illicit drug trafficking has reached the staggering amount of $US 220 billion. Recent tragic events in several countries constitute a proof of the global character of this problem. We welcome the determination of the President of the United States to fight this cancer of mankind and fully support his recent proposals. As a visible symbol of our commitment to this noble cause I shall today sign the 1988 Vienna Convention on Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.Any society will command as much cohesion and stability as its constituent Parts  social changes and transformations have affected  and in some cases even threatened  the basic unit of society.- the family.While family structures greatly vary in different national cultures  there is a general need to strengthen national programmes and international cooperation regarding protection of and support for the family. Austria therefore welcomes the decision of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  based on a proposal by Poland and other countries  to observe an International Year of the Family. Such a year could help to highlight the central function of the family in society. Peace and stability ultimately begin in the home.While in some societies families still provide social and economic security to its members  in others families require public financial support in order successfully to perform their functions  which ultimately benefit everyone.The equality of men and women generally enshrined in international as well as in national legal instruments still needs better translation into the reality of society. Family structures sometimes mask violence against women and children  a fact which requires decisive measures at all levels.The continuous dialogue between the United States and the USSR has facilitated further progress in the area of disarmament and arms control. It presents an unprecedented chance for cooperation in the economic  scientific  cultural and humanitarian fields. A sentiment of mutual interdependence and common responsibility is growing.We welcome the reform process generated by perestroika  which provides a historic opportunity for a new quality in East-West relations. The strengthening of human rights  -the democratisation of public life and the introduction of a socially-oriented market economy constitute essential elements of this reform process. The era of confrontation should be replaced by an era of co-operation. The Vienna Concluding Document of the conference on security and co-operation in Europe has strongly promoted cooperation among European nations. Austria's relations with the other countries of Western Europe are characterized by common values and close economic ties. Austria is a member of the Council of Europe. As a member of the European Free Trade Association we intensified our relationship with the European Community by concluding a free trade agreement in 1972. In July of this year Austria applied for membership in the European Community. We are firmly convinced that participation in the process of European integration is compatible with our status of permanent neutrality.In conclusion  permit me briefly to touch upon the implementation of the Austro-Italian Accord on South Tyrol of 6 September 1946  which has been the subject of General Assembly resolutions 1497 (XV)  the basis of these resolutions agreement was reached in 1969  between Austria and Italy concerning the regulation of regional autonomy by means of 137 concrete measures. Full implementation of these measures is the precondition for a complete settlement of this dispute. Last year I was able to report to the Assembly for the first time  after years of stagnation  that significant and substantive progress had been made and that relations between Austria and Italy had reached excellent levels. This positive trend continued during the past 12 months. We are particularly satisfied with the formal implementation of measures aiming at the equality of the Italian and German languages. This is of fundamental importance for the protection of the German-speaking population.The major part of the measures still to be implemented concerns issues where the Government of Italy has already been active on the basis of the 1969 agreement. However  in view of certain developments in the legal field in Italy  additional commentary measures are now necessary in order to assure the protection of the German-speaking population of South Tyrol in a way agreed upon with Austria.Austria is convinced that the present Italian Government is fully aware of the problems and dangers inherent in a further delay in the full implementation of the 1969 agreement. We are confident that on the basis of the implementation of all remaining measures we shall soon be able to make a declaration to the United Nations stating that we consider the dispute with Italy settled.The recent developments in the relationship between the two super-Powers  the success achieved in solving several regional conflicts  the progress in the implementation of human rights and the general trend towards more openness in international relations  whatever the shortcomings of the existing world order may be  give us reason to be optimistic and encourage us to make further active contributions towards achieving a better world."
"9",443,"BDI",44,1989,"ï»¿	Â· Mr . MBON IMPA (Burundi): As I have the honour of speaking in this important forum of the United Nations  I am happy to convey to the Assembly a message of fraternity and best wishes for every success from Major Pierre Buyoya  Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation and President of the Republic of Burundi. I am also pleased to express on behalf of the Burundi Government warm and heartfelt congratulations to you  Mr. President  and the other officers of the Assembly on the confidence shown in you by the Assembly in entrusting to you all the task of guiding our work. We pay a tribute for you  Mr. President  not only as a wise diplomat  experienced in dealing with the many current concerns of the international community  but also as a great defender of solidarity and co-operation between peoples in a spirit of harmony and mutual respect. Through you. Sir  first Nigeria  your country  and then Africa are honoured. I assure you. Sir  that my delegation is determined to give you all the support it can to bring about the success of your noble mandate.We also join previous speakers in expressing our deep gratitude to Mr.. Daite Caputo  who  as President of the forty-third session guided the Assembly in its many activities with competence and dedication  thus doing honour both to the United Nations and to his country.We also pay a tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for his constant  highly commendable efforts in the service of the international community and for the outstanding successes he has achieved - to his own credit and to that of our Organization - since he assumed his high office. Exactly a year ago I reported here on the situation prevailing in Burundi following the events that had occurred in the north of the country in August 1988. I tried then to explain the origin of those events  their causes and the way in which the authorities of the Third Republic had managed the crisis. Today I wish to report solemnly that Burundi has regained its tranquillity and that its sons and daughters are new living in peace  reconciled and trusting one another.Steps have been taken to organize the return of the refugees who left their motherland. Those steps have been taken in close co-operation with the other member countries of the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries - Zaire and Rwanda - and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  At the beginning the return to the fold was slow  because of fear and unhappy memories of what had happened  but it has now become spontaneous and massive. Over 98 per cent of the refugees had returned by the end of May this year  confounding all the forecasts and proving to the whole world that Burundi is always capable of doing its best. It is undoubtedly an example of success very rare in the voluntary repatriation of refugees anywhere in the world.The repatriates  welcomed as Burundi citizens  have been resettled on the lands they left. As soon as they were resettled they were invited to be involved in our national unity and to live in the understanding and solidarity that have always characterized Burundi society.The Chairman of the Military Committee for National Salvation and President of the Republic  Major Pierre Buyoya  has called on the refugees and all those who have not yet decided to return to their country  the Burundi citizens who have chosen domicile in the countries that have taken them in  to act as ambassadors of Burundi and not as destroyers  as was the case in the past.At the physical level  it has not been easy to resettle the repatriates. The Governments has made every effort  resorting to the spontaneous generosity of its citizens  but also to the humanitarian  material and financial and provided by friendly countries and agencies. I take this opportunity to express our thanks to all those who have come to our assistance in the operation to repatriate and resettle the refugees as well as in the socio-economic reconstruction of the stricken region.We also thank those who continue to support us in our effort to attain oar goal of the total and final reconciliation of the Burundi people. While past regimes were content to evoke the concept of national unity in official statements and sterile debates  the authorities of the Third Republic have matched words with deeds  with the aim of establishing national unity and reconciliation.National unity is the spearhead of all progress. It is a resource that must be exploited rationally. It has become the corner-stone of the policy of the Administration of the Third Republic  a gamble to be won and a challenge to be met at all costs. We are increasingly proud of our concrete achievements in that direction.Concrete measures already taken by the authorities of the Third Republic include the formation of a government of national unity the establishment of a National Commission charged with studying the question of national unity} and the massive repatriation of refugees in the good conditions I have already described. The aim of those measures is to achieve the fundamental objectives of national reconciliation  social justice and socio-economic development. Let me dwell on those achievements which undoubtedly will have the greatest effect on the future of the Burundi nation  that is r the work of the National Commission entrusted with studying the question of national unity.As I had the honour of stating on 10 October 1988 during the General Assembly's forty-third session  that Commission is composed of persons chosen for their wisdom and integrity and representing all social and professional sectors and all ethnic groups of Burundi. Their task was to carry out a thorough analysis of the question of national unity and to make constructive recommendation s based on research into the historical  social and cultural foundations of Burundi unity and its evolution  and the ways in which it had frequently been thwarted.After thorough and painstaking work  the members of the Commission submitted a report to the President of the Republic. It has been distributed both within Burundi and abroad.For its analysis  the Commission studied the historical and cultural foundations of national unity. It also gave careful consideration to the present situation in respect of the unity of Burundi. The report stressed that divisionists continued to use fallacious reasoning  such as ethnic  regional or clan origins. It revealed that more than 90 per cent of the people of Burundi are peasants who want to live in peace and that therefore the overwhelming majority of the population is not involved in the conflict.The Commission suggested to the Government a series of clear recommendations to guide the people of Burundi in building the country. These recommendations pinpoint actions and a line of conduct for all partners in the Burundi nation and involve our citizens as well as the public administration. The Commission believes that it is necessary above all to condemn and combat all forms of exclusion as well as all phenomena that would back that type of ideology. These phenomena are mainly violence  globalization  extermination  a confusion between the political majority and the ethnic majority  and discriminatory practices.Another recommendation concerns the ethic of national unity. It should be based on respect for the fundamental rights of citizens  the sense of the common good  truth and a love of work. The ethic of national unity should take concrete form in the equality of citizens' rights and duties.The National Commission entrusted with the question of national unity recommended for adoption the establishment by Burundi of a charter of national unity  to be ready in December 1989  a pact to be ratified by the whole population of Burundi  a proclamation of faith and a solemn commitment to justice  peace and democracy.The charter of national unity will define the duties and responsibilities of each citizen regarding unity  the rights of citizens  and  in particular  the security and equality of all. The charter of unity will therefore be a code of conduct and a guideline for living.The other recommendations involve the essential areas of national life  and concern in particular the management of public affairs  education  the training of youth  economic development and information. More specifically  at the political level we shall work for the democratization of institutions  giving priority to the strengthening of a sound political climate. In fact  it is essential that the population be guaranteed an atmosphere of confidence and security  without which no policy of democratization can succeed.The democratization of national political life must be accompanied by the democratic functioning of institutions. This process should provide the country with a Constitution that takes into account Burundi realities and provides for specific machinery to regulate the democratic functioning of the institutions. When he officially received the report of the National Commission entrusted to study the question of national unity  the President of the Republic pledged to follow its recommendations. The Head of State immediately announced practical provisions to be taken by the Government in order to ensure transparency and fairness in the essential areas of life  such as education  employment  security  democratic institutions and the question of refugees.I am pleased to inform the Assembly that most of those provisions have already been implemented and are being carried out successfully.As regards education  appropriate regulations have been drawn up and adopted to guarantee transparency and fairness at all levels of instruction. In the field of employment  access of workers to higher posts in all sectors will be based solely on competence.In pursuance of this endeavour of national reconciliation  on 24 July 1989  the President of the Republic published the results of various provincial colloquia on national unity. The guiding principle of these colloquia  which brought together a large number of our citizens from all social and professional sectors  was that the report of the National Commission on national unity should not be considered as a conclusion but rather as a starting-point for deep reflection by all the citizens of Burundi on the question of national unity.The recommendations made by these colloquia will make it possible to complete the constructive analyses and proposals of the Commission  particularly by drawing up the charter of national unity  which must emerge from the whole Burundi people as a shared vision of a future of unity.Since the establishment of the Third Republic fundamental choices have been made to ensure that institutions are as democratic as possible  even though at one point these developments were curbed by the events of August 1988. Since democracy means participation by all citizens in managing the affairs of the country  all the people of Burundi are participating in the life of the country through dialogue and harmonization  which have become a real mode of government in our country.The Party of Unity for National Progress - which had long been the crucible of national unity - has been restructured in order to serve as the ideal framework for the exercise of this democracy in Burundi. Elections by universal suffrage and secret balloting have already been successfully organised with the aim of establishing the basic organs of the Party. This democratic process will continue up to the highest levels of the Party and the Administration.This process should lead to the establishment of social justice - another concern of the Government of the Third Republic.There is a constant struggle to establish social justice. Measures are taken every day in the health  employment and education sectors so that all citizens of Burundi can participate in the construction of their country  to make it a State of law and peace. Only on that condition will our country be able to focus on its social and economic development.In regard to the latter  the Third Republic has given priority to the development of the rural areas  where 90 per cent of the people of Burundi live. In this context  the fifth five-year plan for social and economic development gives priority to the sectors of agriculture and rural development  and concerted and sustained efforts are being made to develop the social infrastructure  such as schools  health centres and supplies of drinking water. Furthermore  economic management has been improved through a relentless struggle declared by the President of the Republic against corruption  misappropriation of public funds fraud and other misuse of funds. The establishment of a Board of Auditors is part of the same concern.In spite of the priority given to the search for solutions for the internal problems of our country  Burundi is also closely following developments in the international economic and political climate  threatened as it is by hazards of all kinds.Convinced that peace and security are the prerequisites for lasting development  the authorities of Burundi have made them the central objectives of their foreign policy. Tb this end  we focus our efforts on maintaining a calm atmosphere with all of our neighbours  near or far.At the international level  we are indeed pleased at the progress achieved in respect of peace and disarmament. The international communityâs particularly encouraged by the detente which now characterizes international relations. The improvement in Soviet-American relations gives the entire world hope for international stability  since it is seen as a possibility for lasting peace and fruitful co-operation.We also note with great satisfaction the fact that statesmen from all continents are increasingly demonstrating their will and their readiness to do ALL in their power to search for just  peaceful and lasting solutions to armed conflicts or potential conflicts everywhere in the world. This leads one to hope that peace will become a continuing concern throughout the world.In the field of disarmament  Burundi is of the opinion that the narrowing in the American and Soviet positions is creating favourable conditions for the completion of negotiations under way in the bilateral framework  at the Conference on Disarmament  or within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. We are also confident that 1er.g disappointed hopes that some military expenditures could be released for development activities may at last become a reality. We are pleased at the encouraging and reassuring words expressed from this very rostrum by Mr. George Bush  President of the United States of America  and by Mr. Shevardnadze  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet âion  concerning the progressive elimination of nuclear and chemical weapons  and the redaction of conventional weapons.The international community is now paying particular attention to the evolution of regional conflicts. The peace process in Angola see rte today to be at an impasse  after the announcement of UNITA of the suspension of talks following the Gbadolite agreement. We know that that agreement  in which 20 African Heads of State  including my own  were involved  is the result of patient and courageous work. I should like to pay well deserved tribute to President Mobutu of Zaire  for his mediation efforts for peace. I also hope that his recent meeting in Washington with the United States President George Bush will impart new momentum to the peace process begun in Angola. We also urge the parties to the conflict rapidly to resume their negotiations and to comply with the commitments that emerged from the CÃ¬badolite agreement.In South Africa  the Government of the country of apartheid unceasingly proclaims its intention of beginning a new era in that country  but to this day so-called reforms do not have much credibility and remain insignificant because they are not aimed at the foundations of that Ignoble system.The International community must therefore remain vigilant  because those so-called reforms may very well be aimed only at diverting public opinion  we can lend credibility to statements made by the South African authorities only If those authorities resolutely decide to raise the state of emergency now in force  to free all political prisoners including Nelson Mandela and for put an end to the reign of terror against anti-apartheid filters.As regards the question of Namibia the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) - the very basis of the independence process of Namibia - is under way with some difficulty. None the less  the organization of free elections planned for November this year constitutes for the international community a glimmer of hope that Namibia will be independent in 1990 and that we shall be able to welcome it into the community of sovereign nations at the next session of the general Assembly.By the thousands of Namibians who have returned to their motherland we extend fraternal greetings and our wishes for a better life in a free and prosperous Namibia.Still on our own continent  acceptance by the parties to the conflict in Western Sahara of the peace plan of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) is an important step in the settlement of the Sahraoui question. That approach will allow the development of the Sahraoui people. Which will thus be able freely to decide on its future. Burundi urges Morocco and the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic to persevere in their efforts at dialogue and at the peaceful settlement of the conflict.Likewise  the recent conflict between two neighbouring fraternal countries  Senegal and Mauritania  has been given great attention by the authorities of my country. We earnestly hope that the peace efforts made by the President of Mali on behalf of the OAO  and the efforts resumed in May by the President of Egypt  current Chairman of our continental Organization  will soon be successful. We also recognize the peace efforts that President Mubarak is making in southern Africa end in particular in Namibia. That great statesman has had an impact beyond the borders of our continent   d this augurs well for the success of his initiatives. In the Middle East  we support and encourage the initiatives to restore peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples  and in particular the 10-point peace plan proposed by President Mubarak. That plan - which kindled hope - has been seriously considered by the Palestine Liberation Organization (Ð Ð¨)  but we regret that it has just been rejected by the other party to the conflict  Israel. Burundi  which saw in that plain a glimmer of hope for the solution to the problem of Palestine  still hopes that the rejection is only temporary and that Palestinians and Israelis will SOOT  meet at the negotiating table to discuss their long-awaited peace.Elsewhere in the world  the situation in Lebanon has become explosive once again. It is our most ardent wish that the various factions will reach an understanding that will preserve human lives and spare suffering in Lebanon. Our country supports and encourages the mediation efforts of the Arab Tripartite Committee.The International Conference on Cambodia  which has just been held in Paris last August  was aimed at finding a political solution to a crisis that dates back almost 20 years. The global settlement plan for the Cambodian question  which has not yet been accepted by all the parties involved in the conflict  should make it possible to speed the restoration of peace in Cambodia and the subregion. Burundi supports these direct talks and urges the parties to the conflict to choose to strengthen the spirit of dialogue and reconciliation instead of to continue armed fratricidal confrontation.Concerning the question of Korea  my country supports the principle of peaceful reunification. In this framework we urge the leaders of the two fraternal countries to continue their dialogue so that the peace process can soon come to a successful conclusion. Regarding 'the Iran-Iraq conflict  the peace process  already reflected in a cease-fire  should be strengthened by the implementation of the other elements of the peace plan recommended by the United Nations and accepted by the two parties.In Cyprus  the dialogue begun by the two communities  and the process of reconciliation  should continue  for the preservation of the Cypriot nation and in the higher interests of its people.We are sincerely pleased at the atmosphere of understanding and harmony that is developing in Central America. In this context  we are pleased at the conclusion of the Tela accords  and we are glad to welcome the prospects for normalization of relations between the countries in the region.The delegation of Burundi wishes to express its great pleasure at the ever-widening role played by the United Nations in the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts  and to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General for his zeal  dedication and effectiveness in the accomplishment of that noble mission.Together with this somewhat troubled political situation - which does have some encouraging prospects - the developing countries are confronted increasingly by grave economic and environmental constraints. The debt problem  the worsening economic situation and climatic disturbances ate all concerns that increasingly affect the neediest sectors of our populations.In the framework of their efforts to confront the debt problem and the related economic difficulties  many developing countries are implementing economic adjustment programmes. In this respect  the failure of negotiations on the renewal of the International Coffee Agreement has placed the producer countries - especially the smallest among them  including my own - in an extremely delicate situation. In fact  these countries  most of which had just undertaken structural adjustment programmes in their economies - programmes that had begun to generate results will see their hopes crumble if the countries responsible for the failure of negotiations do not review their position. We therefore appeal to the latter to adopt a responsible and united attitude towards the producer countries that are so seriously stricken.Recently a number of countries announced measures to alleviate or write off the debt of the developing countries. We want to take this opportunity to extend our most sincere thanks for these gestures  which reassure us and encourage us to persevere in our programmes for economic recovery. However  these efforts of the developed countries should be accompanied by consideration of measures that would involve the net transfer of resources to the developing countries  as well as the prices of commodities. The strategy of a case-by-case debt resolution  supported by the seven most industrialized countries  seems to us insufficient as a solution to the debt problem. Therefore my country supports firmly the proposal to convene an international conference on debt. We believe that the holding of such a conference could lead to a global approach to the thorny question of indebtedness.Since the problem of the environment began to be studied the international community has become aware of the danger involved in the pollution of the atmosphere  deforestation  desertification and other scourges by which nature is damaged. It has also undertaken intensive activity to mobilize State and specialized agencies involved in these fields in order that appropriate international regulations may be established. Burundi is confident that  thanks to this understanding and cooperation by all  the world will be spaced this danger. We cannot gloss over criminal actions of certain industrialized societies in the northern hemisphere that are with impunity transferring toxic wastes to third-world regions. The dangers that this poses to human  animal and vegetable life  present and future  has been denounced many times by the International community. The drug problem constitutes another grave threat to the survival of mankind. We encourage the American and other States that have decided resolutely to combat this scourge  and we urge other nations to follow their example.Today  on the eve of the next century  conditions seems conducive for achieving milestones towards building a world in which peace  justice and security will prevail. Within States dialogue and reconciliation are winning out over confrontation  and in inter-State relations respect for international law is increasing. Considerable progress has been achieved in disarmament. That is why the Burundi delegation urges all Members of the United Nations to do all in their power to safeguard these important achievements and to strengthen this movement for peace and solidarity among nations and peoples."
"10",490,"BEL",44,1989,"ï»¿First of all  allow me warmly to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. I am confident that you will carry out the lofty duties of your office with consummate skill and diplomacy  and my delegation will be happy to join in your efforts and co-operate fully with you.I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo. The manner in which he guided our activities during the last session has earned him the unanimous esteem of the Assembly.Following the remarkable statement delivered by my French colleague  Mr. Roland Dumas  on behalf of the European Community and its member States  there is little need for me to taking up every subject in the wide range of concerns shared by the Twelve in today's world.Some 40 years ago  Mr. Paul-Henri Spaak  then Foreign Minister of Belgium  addressed the third session of the United Nations General Assembly in a remarkable speech that had a world-wide impact. Mr. Spaak  who was also President of the Assembly's first session just after the Second World War  stated in 1948 that Belgium's foreign policy  as well as the foreign policies of other Western democracies  was governed by fear  fear of the totalitarian way of government  fear in the face of territorial expansionism  fear of an ideology of world domination. His famous exclamation - ""We are frightened"" - characterized the prevailing international climate at that time  the climate that led to the cold war - a kind of ""glasnost"" in East-West relations - and  ultimately  to the lowering of an almost hermetically sealed Iron Curtain.Owing to that fear  the political question of East-West relations was for many years to come to be couched mainly from a military perspective. East-West antagonism exacerbated some third-world conflicts  and an arms race ensued that took on surrealistic dimensions.It is a fact of history that equilibrium based on mutual deterrence has been the contributing factor in the prevention of a third world war. Today  however  we find that the arms race has put a considerable strain on our economies and has swallowed up tremendous sums that could otherwise have been channelled into social benefits or into development assistance. In addition  new technologies in modern armaments  as well as the proliferation of all kinds of weapons  seem even to have increased the danger of a sudden conflict's escalating beyond control.It has new become obvious - although the obvious is not always apparent - that peaceful co-operation is an infinitely more secure  more moral and less expensive basis on which to build peace than are relations expressed in terms of pure military strength.The political and economic reforms now being introduced in various socialist countries fill us with hope - hope for courageous policies of renewal  hope for more democratic and prosperous societies and  in particular  hope that the old feelings of fear and mutual distrust may gradually be transformed into ever-growing mutual trust through enhanced East-West co-operation. Reforms in Eastern-bloc countries have become absolute necessities under the pressure of various factors that have shown themselves more powerful than even the best-equipped ideologies.The media and other modern means of communication have shrunk our world to village proportions. At the end of the day no State can afford to live in isolation  ignoring the outside world. New technologies  offsprings of creativity  research and the exercise of the critical spirit  meet with difficulties when trying to expand in centrally planned systems. The market economy  however imperfect  appears to be better suited to bringing about the third industrial revolution. As President Mitterrand recently stated  it is no coincidence that the countries with a democratic  pluralistic political system and a market economy based on free competition  subject  of course  to social correction  are also the ones in which the greatest degree of political and economic freedom for the greatest number of citizens goes hand in hand with the highest level of well-being and social justice. More than subtle ideological hair-splitting  hard facts demonstrate that a Western social and economic model of development  linked with the principle of pluralistic democracy  exerts an immense attraction for many countries in the world. That is given further confirmation in Europe by the continuous flow of refugees and immigrants from East to West.It is clear that efforts made in the field of armaments  which in certain countries has accounted for up to 15 per cent of gross national product in recent years  have completely precluded the pursuit of economic policies that can effectively address the needs of the populations. Consequently  economic and political reform must be accompanied by arms control and arms reduction if political decision-makers want to avoid a number of vicious circles.We realize how difficult and delicate the implementation of such a process of political reform can be. The complementarity of economic and political liberalization entails striking an extremely fragile balance. As Foreign Minister Roland Dumas stated on behalf of the Twelve  the fact that China has not acknowledged this fact and this parallelism has given rise to a tragic reversal.We welcome the favourable developments that have emerged from the disarmament negotiations in Vienna and Geneva. The numbers now on the table can be qualified as quite spectacular. The reduction of the level of armaments must be established in a balanced and reciprocal manner  and it must be accompanied by absolutely trustworthy verification mechanisms. Those are the prerequisites for an even more comprehensive disarmament process. We also welcome President Mikhail Gorbachev's reference to the possibility of a ""defensive defence""  that is  a disarmament process that renders any attack impossible and that  at the same time  continues to guarantee effective defence utilizing the most modern weapons at the lowest possible level of deployment. That is precisely what we have always tried to achieve. Indeed  our primary goal is to arrive at a state of defence that is mutually and sufficiently deterrent with the smallest possible arsenal  thereby creating maximum stability and security. Belgium hopes that new disarmament agreements between East and West can be very rapidly concluded  and that as a consequence major financial resources can gradually be freed so that we can pay more attention to other priorities. In the Eastern bloc as well as in Western countries  these financial resources could be spent on modernizing economic and industrial structures and on improving social conditions. Also  we must not forget conservation of the environment and the establishment of -a suitable policy on the environment. A major conference on this subject is to be held shortly in Sofia as part of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The United Nations also has an important role to play in this field  particularly in respect of preparing universal rules and standards. In this context  the important Conference on Environment and Development  which is to take place in 1992  will be a real challenge  one which we must meet. We did not receive our planet Earth  which is getting smaller every day  as an inheritance from our parents: rather  we have borrowed it from our children. Our responsibility here is enormous  irrespective of what our economic and political systems may be.Disarmament and better understanding between East and West can also have a decisive influence on the North-South dialogue and can shed a fundamentally different light on what the approach should be to the problems of the third world. If confidence between East and West grows  many regional conflicts  which are in fact tragic side-effects of the tensions between the two great Powers  can probably be ended. We cannot but rejoice at the progress made in this area and at the many efforts made by all sides toward solving  peacefully through talks and negotiations  a whole range of regional conflicts and chronic tensions. It is none the less true that there are situations still persisting which provide heart-rending examples of violence and repression  such as Lebanon â until recently - and the Middle East and various other regions. Belgium pays a tribute to the Arab League and to the three mediators for the positive role they have played in the Lebanese question  and hopes that the peace process in that region will enable us to bring a speedy end to hostage-taking and to the inhuman fate that has befallen five of my compatriots whose names have been added to the long  sad list of hostages from other countries.Improved East-West relations and better economic conditions in the industrialized countries are vitally important in our relations with the third world countries. At the special session of the General Assembly in 1979 and at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Manila  I submitted a proposal  on behalf of Belgium  for the implementation of a pact for growth in solidarity between the industrialized countries and countries in the third world which wished to join. The pact envisaged a substantial increase in development aid in direct proportion to the economic growth in each participating country and was geared to generating growth within the third world itself. Now that the world economy is healthier and East-West relations are developing in a positive direction  I think that this Belgian proposal could be brought up to date and submitted to the appropriate United Nations organs for thorough examination.If we could unite our forces to usher in a post-cold-war era  other proposals and ideas could be envisaged. Why  for example  should it be inconceivable to implement triangular development projects  to be carried out  in a third-world country  by a Western country in association with an Eastern-bloc country? Why  indeed?Concerning the explosive problem of the indebtedness of the third-world countries - although other countries are also facing the snowballing  devastating effects of debt burdens - Belgium supports the multilateral approach of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Belgium recently decided on cancellation  pure and simple  of the State-to-State loans made to 13 African countries. Moreover  Belgium and Zaire have concluded an agreement for Belgium to waive payment of a third of Zaire's commercial debt to Belgium and to reschedule the outstanding interest payments. The package was coupled with the establishment of a re-utilization fund in Zairian currency for local development projects. We hope that this agreement between Belgium and Zaire will set an example to other creditor and debtor countries. In respect of Africa  and primarily Rwanda and Burundi  Belgium is pursuing a coherent policy towards reaching imaginative solutions to debt problems  with firm emphasis on joint management of the funds allocated to development.The problems of the third world have been considerably aggravated by the scandalous traffic in arms  itself too often financed by the even greater disgrace of the traffic in drugs. Belgium favours an effective international embargo on all arms exports to belligerents  and we welcome the remarkable and extremely courageous efforts of the President of the United States  Mr. George Bush  and the President of Colombia  Mr. Virgilio Barco Vargas  in combating drug production and trafficking.The international community will understand that the countries of the European Community attach great importance to respect for human rights and that our aid and co-operation are assessed in terms of the progress made in human rights. Indeed  we believe that all people  as individuals  as human beings  wherever they are in the world  have the right to the full enjoyment of their inalienable rights and the exercise of their fundamental freedoms. In saying this  and in acting as we do  we Europeans cannot but be modest and self-critical. This year  1989  is the year we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War on our old continent  which saw the most terrible and complete negation of human rights in the history of mankind. Belgium would like to pay a tribute to the unrelenting efforts of the United Nations and fully associates itself with them. Thus Belgium is participating in the United Nations action in Namibia and has sent people there as part of the peace-keeping operations to assist in monitoring the independence process. I wish to pay a tribute to the tireless efforts and devotion of the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and of his staff  which have led to the achievement of solutions to many conflicts through negotiation and conciliation.We also fully support the efforts that are being made within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to reach an agreement on the banning of all chemical weapons. We must all work together to enable the United Nations to work even more effectively. Theoretical and ideological debates are not getting us far enough; only programmes of concrete action are worthwhile.The European Community - with its common market soon to be achieved  with economic and monetary unity  having in view a political unification  hence a common foreign and security policy - this Community  comprised of 12 member States  hopes to become an increasing factor in stability  peace and co-operation in the world  especially in Europe. I sometimes wonder whether this Europe we are striving for is being perceived correctly abroad. There are those who fear the Community  others who encourage it  and still others who ignore it.The Europe of today was born of dreams but also of a sense of the realities which  40 years ago  gave rise to the first attempts at integration. Europe is neither a self-centred fortress nor a mill open to all passing winds. Rather it seeks to be a magnet and a model for progress  generating freedom and happiness for its citizens. This Europe of the Twelve is not a Power  it is a potent force.This Europe which is ours and which we are continuing to build day by day prefers co-operation to confrontation in all its affairs. We firmly believe that a strengthened European Community can contribute significantly to the establishment of genuine co-operation between East and West  so that the last scars left by the Second World War can finally be healed in our hearts and in reality.A common European house is conceivable only if it is indeed a truly democratic house  where every citizen will be free to enjoy his fundamental political and economic freedoms as well as adequate social protection - where State authorities serve the individual and not the contrary. ""Everybody is somebody"" must be the humanist maxim of Government in our modern societies  where the growing complexity tends to overwhelm the individual. We must therefore give priority support to those countries that effectively implement policies of reform based on those values. That is the reason for our present aid to and co-operation with  countries such as Poland and Hungary.The common European house - that of co-operation between East and West - need not result in a Europe of uniformity. It may have different rooms in which each separate people may organize itself as a State  according to its right to self-determination. But it is obvious that such a European house is unthinkable as long as a Berlin Wall continues to divide Europeans.There are many signs of hope appearing on the horizon. Let that hope not be deceived. After decades of fear and mutual terror  reciprocal confidence must increase. It is not too early; indeed it is high time."
"11",535,"BEN",44,1989,"ï»¿First and foremost  I Should like to convey my sincere congratulations  and those of the people and Government of Benin  to Mr. Joseph Garba on his well-deserved election to the presidency of fee forty-fourth session of fee General Assembly of fee United Nations  That unanimous choice is a tribute not only to Nigeria  with which Benin has historical  fraternal and fruitful relations  but also to all the peoples of Africa.Your exceptional diplomatic skills  Mr. President  your perspicacity and the respect and esteem in which you are held by the international community guarantee the success of this session.Allow me to express my delegation's great admiration for Mr. Dante Caputo  former Minister of foreign Affairs of Argentina  for fee energetic  clear-sighted and effective manner in which he guided the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  both in New York and in Geneva. We pay tribute to him for fee wisdom he showed in ensuring that justice and democracy prevailed through the adoption of decisions feat have been beneficial to the international community and have enhanced the prestige of cur shared Organization.I take this opportunity also to express my delegation's great appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for all the work he has done to create more favourable conditions for the restoration of peace in fee world  and for his tireless and praiseworthy endeavours to strengthen the role and importance of fee United Nations.The world of today is undergoing profound changes that are being Celt in international relations as a climate of detente. Those changes are apparentparticularly in the fields of disarmament  regional conflicts  economic relations  and humanitarian and social problems. That was the conclusion just reached by the Heads of State and Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at its ninth conference  held from 4 to 7 September in Belgrade. They stated that:""Some favourable developments are emerging and spreading in international relations. Conflicts and hostilities are tending to give way to negotiations  understanding and co-operation. It would appear that the path leading to the establishment of lasting peace is opening up"".Indeed  almost two years ago that the United States of America and the Soviet Union ushered in a new era in modern international relations in the form of a fruitful dialogue between their top leaders. At that time  my country welcomed the signing of the Washington agreements and the Geneva negotiations between those two great Powers. It is happy to associate itself with many other countries in expressing the hope that the dialogue that they have begun will continue and that the talks under way between then on strategic weapons will very soon bear fruit  increasing mutual confidence and yielding results beneficial to the whole of mankind.The peoples of the world yearn for peace and the people of Benin hopes that the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union will allow them to speed up the process leading to general and complete disarmament. That is why the People's Republic of Benin supports the international community's efforts to make permanent the climate of relaxation that is so favourable to disarmament negotiations.Disarmament remains the surest way today of creating an atmosphere conducive to the establishment of lasting peace in the world. But disarmament must be conceived and carried out in a way that will enhance the well-being of mankind as a whole and ensure that the vital balance is struck between the various categories of States that make up the international community. Disarmament should serve development by permitting a significant increase in the resources of countries beset by hunger  disease and poverty.I am convinced that the implementation of the programme of Action adopted at the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  held here in New York in 1987  will free the resources necessary for the economic and social development of the poorest countries  and should promote better living conditions for the peoples of the developed countries. In that respect  the States that have always had doubts about this relationship between disarmament and development should  in a spirit of solidarity with the rest of the international community  join in the consensus that has been achieved.Once again my country commends the constant striving for disarmament  and welcomes the encouraging results of the Conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons held in Paris from 7 to 11 January 1989 at the invitation of Mr. Francois Mitterand  President of the French Republic.Benin hopes that in the near future the work of the Geneva Committee will result in the preparation of an international convention banning the manufacture and use of chemical weapons  which have caused so many atrocities and such suffering over recent decades.The terrible consequences of conflicts and tensions between countries and the threats of annihilation that beset mankind have impressed on all the countries and peoples of the world the need to achieve peace by means of dialogue and negotiation.However  many regions oÂ£ our world continue to be disrupted by conflicts. In southern Africa  after decades of humiliation and suffering  the heroic people of Namibia is moving towards full sovereignty. My country welcomes the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is recalled  confirmed and updated for Security Council resolution 632 (1989). All the States Members of the Organization  and especially the five permanent members of the Security Council  should exert all their influence and demonstrate their clear-sightedness in order to keep the resources of the military element of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) at the level envisaged in resolution 435 (1978)  as recommended by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) the front-line States  the organization of African Unity  and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.The tragic events in Namibia since 1 April 1989 could have been avoided had the forces of UNTAG been larger and possessed more means to control the situation in the field in accordance with the spirit and letter of the relevant Security Council resolutions.Our organization  therefore  should do its utmost to ensure compliance with the terms of resolutions 435 (1978) and 632 (1989) in order to enable the Namibian people freely to attain international sovereignty. 1 take this opportunity to express my country's indignation at the assassination on Tuesday  12 September 1989  of Anton Lubowski  a member of the political bureau of the South West Africa People's organization and to pay a tribute to the courage of all the leaders of SWAPO  in particular its Chairman  Sam Nujoma  who  despite that abhorrent act  continues to speak the language of reconciliation and peace. It is the duty of this organization  through its appropriate bodies  to ensure that the process now under way to brines independence to Namibia is successfully completed.My country is also concerned by the persistence of apartheid as a system of government. Apartheid  that crime against humanity  continues to manifest itself in increased repression  police brutality  imprisonment  prolonged detention of the leaders of the black majority  bantustanization  banishments  restrictions  the banning of mass organizations and so forth.The people and Government of Benin support the struggle of the valiant people of South Africa united in nationalist movements such as the African National Congress of South Africa CANC) and all the other political parties and mass organizations which are resisting apartheid. The People's Republic of Benin reaffirms  through me  its resolute and categorical condemnation of the so-called elections of 6 September. 1989  which were only a parody of democracy  because they excluded the vast majority of the South African people. My country welcomes the wise decision of our Organization to hold from 12 to 14 December 1989 a special session of the General Assembly devoted to apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa. We hope that this will be an important step forward towards stamping out that repellent system.I could not speak about the problems of the southern part of our continent without mentioning the peace efforts which are emerging in Angola and Mozambique. The Brazzaville Protocol  the New York agreements  the summit meetings at Gbadolite and Harare and the various meetings between delegations of the parties concerned are favourable signs of peace and security in Angola and Mozambique. The establishment of peace in those two fraternal countries will enable their respective peoples to tackle the tasks of reconstruction and development. Therefore  the People's Republic of Benin encourages them to persevere on the oath of reconciliation and national unity.Similarly  we welcome and wish to encourage the negotiations currently under way aimed at restoring a climate of peace in the Sudan and Ethiopia.My country also welcomes the signing of the agreement between Chad and Libya of 31 August 1989  which offers fresh hopes for a peaceful political settlement of the conflict between those two countries. In this respect  Benin warmly welcomes the spirit of concession  understanding and tolerance displayed by the Chadian and Libyan leaders as well as the firm determination off the Organization of African Unity (OAU) through its Ad Hoc Committee  and certain African Heads of State in seeking ways and means of arriving at a permanent solution to that dispute.With regard to Western Sahara  Benin firmly hopes that resolution 104 (XIX) of the organization of African Unity and General Assembly resolution 43/33 will be fully and effectively implemented.The People's Republic of Benin appreciates the sustained efforts undertaken by the POLISARIO Front and the Kingdom of Morocco to achieve a negotiated peace. We welcome the proposals and actions of the current Chairman of the OAU and the United Nations Secretary-General to organize a referendum on self-determination. The dialogue which has been started between these two parties must be continued in order to avoid any further escalation of the war  with the attendant disastrous consequences.With respect to the dispute between Senegal and Mauritania  Benin supports the mediation efforts of the OAU and fervently hopes that tolerance and mutual understanding by both parties will prevail and that a just and lasting solution may be found that takes into account the genuine interests of those two fraternal peoples  united by so many long-standing  indissoluble links.In the Middle East  progress towards peace has been slow. My country is convinced there can be no genuine peace in that part of the world without a solution to the Palestinian problem. The People's Republic of Benin welcomes and wishes to encourage the efforts of the international community to convene an international conference on the Middle East  with the participation on an equal footing of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation organization (PLO). The situation prevailing in Lebanon remains a matter of grave concern. My country supports all efforts aimed at restoring unity to the people of Lebanon and guaranteeing its full sovereignty and the territorial integrity of its country by means of negotiation. The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq must be confirmed by the opening of negotiations to bring about lasting peace  under the auspices of the Security Council and by recognition of the important role of the United Nations Military Observe: Group in maintaining the cease-fire.Conflicts and tension still persist in South-East Asia despite the progress made at the first and second informal meetings in Jakarta in July 1988 and February 1989. While the international Conference on Peace in Cambodia  held in Paris from 30 July to 30 August 1989  made possible important steps towards the restoration of peace  it did not  unfortunately  arrive at a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian problem  despite the praiseworthy diplomatic efforts of the French and Indonesian Governments. My country expresses the hope that weapons will yield to the rule of law and that the conflict will be settled on the basis of scrupulous respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the countries of South-East Asia and the effective withdrawal of all foreign troops.With regard to the situation in Afghanistan  Benin notes that  despite the implementation of resolution 43/20  which was adopted by consensus at the forty-third session of the General Assembly  the Afghan people continues to live in an atmosphere of insecurity and uncertainty. The effective restoration of peace requires scrupulous compliance with the agreement concluded between all the parties.Still in Asia  the question of the reunification of Korea remains a burning issue. The People's Republic of Benin supports the position of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which reaffirmed at its last summit conference  in  Belgrade  that such reunification would be promoted by fostering mutual confidence and reconciliation of the north and the south and by the phased and balanced reduction of armed forces on the Korean peninsula.My country can only welcome the important developments in Latin America and the Caribbean  which have taken various forms: democratisation  emancipation  consolidation of national independence  concerted political action and economic integration. Benin supports the peace agreements signed by the Heads of State of Central America  particularly the one -just signed in Tela  Honduras  which is aimed at establishing lasting peace in the region.The climate of detente which currently prevails in international political relations is not  unfortunately  echoed in the economic field. There can be no peace and no security in the world without the prospects of economic prosperity for all countries and all peoples. The prolonged economic crisis emerged against a background of worsening inequalities  poverty  disease and hunger  with all the various frustrations that these bring in their wake. The drop in commodity prices  the heavy burden of external debt  profound structural handicaps  the drastic reduction in growth rates in the least developed countries  such as mine  and the fall in export earnings are tremendously difficult challenges for us to take up without massive and effective support from the international community.The mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development demonstrated that the success of that Programme depends to a large extent on the political resolve of the leaders of the industrialized countries  as African States have already made tremendous sacrifices in implementing reform policies. Indeed  it is necessary for the developed countries to honour their undertakings to provide African States with sufficient assistance  particularly financial assistance  to ensure the success of structural adjustment programmes that have been agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The usefulness of such programmes  which have the merit of rationalizing production structures and expenditure machinery  has been proven  even though sometimes they generate social tensions because they are too inclined to give pride of place to major macro-economic balances. It is important that these situations be understood by the whole international community  which we urge to provide active support for the measures undertaken by the developing countries in order to attenuate these disturbing social consequences of economic recovery programmes.As representatives are aware  Benin has agreed with the IMP and the World Bank upon a structural adjustment programme with the IMF and the World Bank. May I  once again  offer my country's thanks to the States and international organizations that have contributed to the drawing up of our programme. Allow me also to express ray Government's gratitude to all the developed countries that have announced the writing off of certain debts  to the benefit of the developing countries  and in particular of the least developed countries  including my own. This is undoubtedly one way of giving relief to the poorest countries. But the international community needs to draw up a new global strategy aimed at recovery in the developing countries' economies. It is desirable that the General Assembly  at this session  set the right tone so that the special session scheduled for April 1990 may take the appropriate decisions.The concerns of the international community  in the face of environmental problems  have become more acute  given the threat of the dumping of toxic and hazardous wastes by the developed countries in the developing countries. It is thus urgent that we work together to establish measures that will prevent disruption in the world's ecological balance and will enable us to develop our capacity to maintain life.It is important to take appropriate measures to halt the process of water pollution and air pollution  the progressive depletion of the ozone layer  soil degradation  deforestation and desertification  and the intolerable process by which many rare animal species are becoming extinct. We value highly the measures taken under the United Nations Environment Programme  aimed at discouraging activities likely to threaten the quality of the marine environment and the ecological balance of the seas. My country welcomes also the proposal to convene  before the end of 1992  the second world conference on environment and development. Similarly  Benin isready to support any measures aimed at drafting an international convention on the protection and conservation of the world's climate.The year 1988 was the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human rights - an anniversary that was marked both in New York  at the forty-third session of the General Assembly  and among the Member States. This was an opportunity for the international community to gauge the significant successes achieved by the United Nations in promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and to assess what remains to be done in order to ensure the total liberation of mankind. The events that marked this commemoration in Benin took place throughout 1988 and are continuing in 1989. The international seminar on human rights and economic and social progress  and the national seminar in the People's Republic of Benin on the promotion and protection of human rights - held respectively from 30 May to 3 June and from 21 November to 25 November 1988 - the conferences and round tables on human rights organized in December 1988  and the translation into eight national languages of the text of the Universal Declaration have all been significant events in this programme.Furthermore  many measures have been taken by the Government of Benin in the area of the promotion and protection of human rights. I should like to mention in particular the promulgation of the law setting up the Beninese Commission on Human rights  and the legal decision to great a general amnesty. But all our efforts will be in vain if we lose sight of the future of the world. As may be imagined  I wish to speak of children and their situation - those of whom the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has said: ""Children do not live and grow up in a different world; they live in our world  and their survival and growth depend on the health of our societies. The situation of children in the world is bound up with growth and development  just as their well-being is vital for economic and social Progress."" Having grasped at an early stage the fundamental importance of protecting children  Benin is taking part in the Bamako initiative  and  with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  is carrying out the health project of Pahou  a few kilometres from Cotonou.Furthermore  my country is committed to winning the battle to have all Beninese children vaccinated. Our aim is to have between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of all children covered by the end of the year 1990. In conjunction with the effective activities of UNICEF  many States have supported the idea of holding a world summit on children in 1990. In support of this great idea  and in order to translate it into practical terms  the General Assembly should at its forty-fourth session adopt unreservedly the Convention on the rights of the Child  submitted for its consideration by the Executive Director of UNICEF.As the principal political organization that is truly universal in character  the United Nations should continue to play a salutary role in the area of promoting world peace by means of general and complete disarmament  the suppression of all hotbeds of tension  the establishment of a fairer and more equitable international economic order  the protection of the environment  the campaign against hunger in the world  the elimination of all forms of social inequality  including racial discrimination and apartheid  and the promotion and protection of human rights and the rights of peoples and children. Benin supports this Organization fully  in the hope that it will help all the peoples of the world to realize their legitimate aspiration to freedom  justice  peace and social progress. "
"12",581,"BFA",44,1989,"ï»¿Burkina Paso and Nigeria on joy fraternal and friendly relations. Therefore it is with some pride and pleasure that we see as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session a son of Africa whose experience  personality and qualities are well known in the United Nations.To his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  we would like to convey our appreciation for the way in which he performed his functions. The Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organisation  as usual  has provided us with a complete overview of the state of the world and of the efforts made by our Organization. Mr. de Cuellar's patience  tireless activity and quiet determination have made it possible for the Organization to go through periods of great uncertainty until we have now reached a time when recognition off the need for our Organization has once again become unanimous.""On the strength of this  I venture to hope that at the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly the last guns will have been silenced on the last battlefields of the world  the Palestinians will be back in their land building a future together with the Israelis  the state of emergency will have been lifted in South Africa  Nelson Mandela will have been released from the apartheid gaol and  finally  Namibia will occupy in this Hall  somewhere between Mozambique and Nepal  the place that has been its right for so long  and for which it has waited far too long|."" (A/43/FV.7  p. 64)these words which X have just quoted were the final paragraph of Burkina Peso statement in the general debate at the forty-third session.Thee implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has gone through  lassitude and it is our hope that the present stage will see all parties keep : their commitment and make it possible for the provisions of the Security Council resolution to be applied fully and in their entirety. The Namibian peoples right to self-determination should be exercised in justice and democracy. We would also like to express again our confidence in the Secretary-General in the delicate ask that is his of ensuring that the process initiated will not be blocked by manoeuvres and diversionary tactics. It is being said and what has been done by the South African authorities do not o m to indicate that this ignominy of the present time  apartheid  has been attained at its root by its supporters. We cannot speak of any changes or improvement when Nelson Mandela and his companions remain in prison  when the movements that are demanding freedom are systematically restrained  when political parties and democratic movements are suspended  when the state of emergency is still in force  and when there is no sign of the beginnings of any real  consistent or detailed dialogue aimed at resolving the problem.The fact that the international community has made the apartheid regime anathema has not yet brought it down. Nevertheless  the struggles and sacrifices of the South African people have induced the racist authorities to restrain their language and to come up with offers which could be expected to be confirmed subsequently by the simple dismantling of the apartheid regime. The recent elections in which more than 70 per cent of the population was excluded and the refusal of the racist authorities to recognize the democratic principle of ""one man one vote"" are not in keeping with the bland reassurances of President De Klerk.The racist regime of Pretoria thus continues to pursue its policy of apartheid and destabilization of the front-line states  and the international community expects more than a chance in style and language. It expects feat men have their dignity restored to them.The right of peoples is also being violated in the territories occupied by Israel. The right of fee Palestinian people to self-determination is ignored by Israel  The intifadah has been the bold and resolute response of a people which is determined to regain its inalienable and undeniable rights. Oppression and repression are the twin sinister companions which are no longer able to stifle the powerful cry for sovereignty and freedom of a people which has been gagged and trampled underfoot.It must be regretted that Israel is locked in its conviction that concessions are due it  that Israel refuses to admit the increasingly incontrovertible reality that the Palestinian people do exist  that Palestine exists and that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is the authentic representative of fee Palestinian people.Hitherto  important decisions have been taken by the Palestinian side without any positive Israeli reaction having been recorded. The Israeli authorities have stated that there will be no elections so long as the intifadah continues  that Jewish colonies will continue to be installed in fee occupied territories and that there will be no peace except under those conditions and only with those with whom they choose to speak. None of this is likely to restore peace to fee region.That is not the logical path to take  and on 6 October last the General Assembly confirmed this once again When it demanded that Israel fulfil its obligations.Just as apartheid has set southern Africa ablaze  Israel's policy as cause  effect and pretext has turned Lebanon into a victim on its last gasp. A country  a people  and a nation ace disintegrating. Burkina Faso supports the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League to promote dialogue and the search for peace. We hope that peace will come to the Middle East  through the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of all the parties concerned  in particular Palestine. regional conflicts we hops will be resolved continue to cause concern in the international community.The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  pursuant to the Geneva Agreements  has withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan more than six months ago. Burkina Faso supports all efforts to safeguard the sovereignty  independence  and territorial integrity of Afghanistan  as well as the unity of its people.We appeal to Iran end Iraq to take the necessary action in order to ensure the complete implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1967).It was not possible to conclude en agreement at the Paris Conference on Cambodia  but we may still entertain some hope since the Conference is scheduled to resume at the beginning of 1990. The withdrawal of foreign troops should lead to dialogue among all the parties to the conflict  the only ones likely to arrive at the necessary compromises for a return to peace and the non-aligned status of Kampuchea. Similarly  in Central America we urge respect for the Esquipulas II agreements  so that the peoples of the region may enjoy peace and stability. Until this connection  the appeal must not go unheeded.The question of Cyprus has still not been resolved  and we support all efforts to preserve its unity  sovereignty  independence and non-aligned status.We reaffirm our solidarity wife the Korean people. Burkina Faso supports fee proposals for a peaceful reunification of Korea and to feat end we urge fee continuation of the North-South dialogue.The efforts of the international community  in particular those of the African countries  led to fee beginning of a solution in Angola and Mozambique. Burkina Paso sincerely hopes feat these efforts will culminate in a final settlement guaranteeing fee national unity and independence of these two fraternal countries and making it possible for them to channel their energies into the tasks of development. And may all interference be excluded.Wife regard to Western Sahara  courageous decisions have been taken to speed up fee peace process drawn up by fee United Nations on fee basis of fee relevant resolutions of the organization off African Unity (OAU). We urge the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts in conjunction wife fee current Chairman of the OAU with a view to implementing the right to self-determination of the Sahraoui people.A distressing conflict has pitted two West African brothers against each other. Like a number of other African States  Burkina Faso is closely following this dispute and  in its capacity as Chairman to the Economic Continuity of West African States  is exerting its own efforts to find a peaceful and final settlement. Burkina Faso welcomes and is gratified by the recent agreements entered into by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Chad  thus putting an end to 16 years of fratricidal confrontation.It can be seen that there are still regional conflicts  although for the past two years the international climate has been described as having improved. Burkina Faso recognizes that there has been some improvement in the way in which problem are being tackled. Systematic confrontation or confrontation as a matter of principle has given way to dialogue and negotiation. No one could complain of such a turn of events. Nevertheless  for us  the countries of the South or fee third world  we cannot confuse style with substance.Although changing fee way fee problem is posed helps to resolve it  feat does not change the actual nature of the problem.Indeed  fee inequity of fee international economic system is penalizing our national economies and frustrating the efforts and sacrifices of our peoples. Year after year we have made use of fee rostrum of fee United Nations to make known our ills; we have gone to the institutions of the United Nations to heal our afflictions. In May 1986  fee critical economic situation in Africa led to the adoption of the United Nations programme of Action for African Recovery and Development  but its promise has not been fully realized. External debt has emphasized a glaring and obvious injustice. Our products are increasingly fetching below-market prices  while we are reimbursing many times over fee money we have borrowed  in view of the play of bank interest rates. This situation must be seen as very serious by debtors and creditors alike  because in fee long run it will be harmful to all parties.In a world of interdependence where words are uttered and used as weapons - which  in any case have finally become blunted - it is nevertheless necessary to have recourse to negotiation  take into account the interests involved and inevitably move towards the implementation of a lust international economic order. The special session on international economic co-operation  to be held in April 1990  should not be just one more meeting* rather  it should mark a new approach in economic relations among States so that justice  equity and mutual advantage prevail in the world economy. However unrealistic this outcome may seem  it is nevertheless the best way to protect us all from economic paralysis and the incalculable consequences that that would entail.In this connection  the environment which is today considered everyone's business  has long suffered the excesses and uses of the North  whether it be the ozone layer  acid rains  toxic wastes - we know where the responsibility lies. Hence we should welcome the fact that the environment has become an essential concern and that preparations are now being made for the United Nations conference on environment and development  scheduled for 1992.We listened very closely to the statement made by President Virgilio Barco of Colombia. As we see it  two lessons can be learned from its the first is that  as he said  the international struggle against drugs cannot be a mere war of words; and the second  that in order to stem the supply of drugs  we must stem the demand for drugs.In both cases it is co-operation and solidarity that can heal this contemporary wound. All the scourges that today beset human society can be overcome only through co-operation and solidarity.A deplorable economic and social situation is the reason why this drug culture has developed. Burkina Paso affirms that this is a case involving human rights andthe rights of peoples. We refuse to follow anyone who ascribes importance exclusively to the individual and to the protection and security of the individual  when millions are ignored  trampled underfoot  exploited  reduced to earning a living by compromising their lives and the lives off others. The champions off human rights have enough compassion to defend freedom; but not enough wisdom to defend human beings made of flesh and blood  not enough wisdom to stop children born and raised in disastrous circumstances from being condemned to a life of delinquency and crime. Somewhere along the line more attention began to be paid to abstract ideas than to meeting our practical  basic  concrete  pressing  real needs  when we seek to defend human rights we should begin with those needs. The defence of human rights begins with the promotion of a just international economic order.In Burkina Faso  Comrade President Compaore  the leader of the Popular Front  is translating that desire for justice by organizing and ensuring the participation of people of all social levels and classes in making the political and economic decisions that mould our national life and our future. Democracy is a requirement of the Burkina Faso revolution. Revolution  for us  is not a hollow revolutionary slogan taken out of context  but the creative spirit linked to practical action towards qualitative change sustained and implemented in a permanent  organized way by the mass of the people for the mass of the people. In that context  women play a major role  children receive particular care and society acts in its own best interests  in order to live within its culture in harmony with the world.Many have spoken of the imminent twenty-first century  the heritage we shall bequeath to our children  the increasingly interdependent world  threats and hopes. We in Burkina Faso want to live with our brothers throughout the world as worthy  free people. Co-operation and solidarity are the virtues needed today  tomorrow  and forever if we wish to bequeath a future to the generations to come. With that in mind we must be just and specific."

Rich tributes are due to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  for the leadership he provided us during the last session.I must commence my statement with some words of well-deserved praise for our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.

He has not only carved for himself a niche in our hearts  but has also reserved for himself a place in the pantheon of history.There is much the United Nations system has achieved  though more remains to be done. None the less  in recent months  the credibility of our Organization has not only been enhanced but the confidence of the global community in its institutions has also taken firm root. Today there is widespread belief that the United Nations has the unique potential and capacity  not only to adjust and accommodate  but also to fashion a concerted response to the multidimensional contemporary problems through a co-operative approach and management.Last year Bangladesh was devastated by the worst floods in living memory. This Assembly reacted quickly to offer timely succour to the stricken. To help raise resources for longer-term measures a special meeting on assistance to Bangladesh was convened here last year. Since then  vital remedial action has been initiated. A massive national effort was mobilized  under the direct supervision of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad  to rehabilitate and reconstruct the affected areas  and to readjust and revitalize their economy. A comprehensive flood- protection programme was formulated. Unparalleled international response  together with the courage and resilience of the people  helped avert the famine and epidemic and the negative growth that were predicted.We are determined to do all that is possible nationally. However  there is now implicit recognition that disaster control involves co-operation beyond our borders  and resources beyond our modest means. Thus  sustained efforts have been launched bilaterally  regionally and internationally to supplement our national efforts. Special emphasis has been given to the preparation of studies for a durable solution. An international conference on floods in Bangladesh  convened by the World Bank  is scheduled to be held in December this year in London. We hope for your co-operation with a view to its success.Many of Bangladesh's serious economic problems  severe development constraints and other formidable challenges  exacerbated by environmental degradation  are problems we share with others in a comparable milieu. The decade of the 19 80s has thus been a decade of serious disappointment  bordering on despair  for a majority of the developing countries. The gap between the developed and developing nations during this most turbulent period has increased. Although richer nations were able to pull out of a serious economic recession to enjoy the longest period of economic expansion since the Second World War  the crisis in a vast majority of the developing countries has continued unabated.Countries in Latin America and Africa have thus remained deeply entrenched in a critical situation. The world's poorest  the least developed countries  continue to be mired in a serious development crisis. Growth in these countries has continued to be either sluggish or even negative. The proportion of ""hard-core poor"" in these countries has increased staggeringly. Underlying this precarious situation is the reality that all the important elements for sustained development of developing countries are stalling. Commodity prices  so important for these countries  still remain at an unacceptable low level. External indebtedness continues to take a heavy toll on their economies  and the flow of resources continues  paradoxically  to go from the poor of the developing South to the rich in the North.The reality of interdependence makes these concerns the concern of every country. In Belgrade  earlier this month  President Hussain Muhammad Ershad had underscored  as an undeniable priority  the need for a global consensus on the approaches towards the solution of these problems. Only such a consensus can lead to a solution. This also requires the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive set of measures that address all aspects of the problems that stifle the development of the developing countries. Substantial opportunity exists during the coming months to spell out elements of such a consensus. I speak of the formulation of a development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade  the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation  and the second United Nations conference on least developed countries  scheduled for 1990 in Paris. In those important events we should start from the fundamental premise that no unilateral solution to our problems is possible. The end to the crisis calls for a global dialogue and readiness to act decisively on a wide front.Bangladesh  to improve the global economic climate  would call for concerted and urgent action on the following points:First  there must be a substantial increase in concessionary financial flows to developing countries  particularly the least developed countries  and the flow of the world's surplus must be reversed to meet the need for investment in developing countries. Second  measures must be adopted and implemented to reduce and restructure the crushing debt burden. A growth-oriented debt strategy should be directed towards reduction in interest rates  lowering of interest payments  decisive and substantial reduction of debt obligation and outright cancellation of debt of the least developed countries. Third  ways and means must be found to improve the export-earning potential of developing countries through the expansion of markets  trade liberalization by means of fulfilment of the standstill and roll-back commitments undertaken in the Punta del Este Declaration  stabilization of export earnings  and linkage of debt repayment terms to commodity price and interest rate fluctuations. Fourth  the crucial link between trade  development  and debt must be recognized. Fifth  the developing countries must strengthen their efforts to step up the process of scientific and technological development and their consequent ability to adapt to and absorb new technologies. Sixth  we must concentrate on improving the condition of the least developed countries and on drawing them into the mainstream of the international development process. In that respect  the 1990 United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries should adopt a comprehensive plan of action. Seventh  food security must be ensured  including emergency measures to expand food production in the least developed countries  ensuring adequate food reserves  access to food  and the creation of a nutrition  employment and health network for the most vulnerable groups. Finally  human-resource development must be harnessed and mobilized  especially through concentration on an effective basic-needs framework. This should include emphasis on the disadvantaged segments; women  children and the handicapped.While greater co-operative and urgent action are demanded on the economic front  we can draw comfort from progress made on a number of political issues. These are taking place today on the matrix of a far more relaxed global political backdrop  owing largely to the commendable initiatives and efforts of the super-Powers - the United States and the Soviet Union - their leaders  Governments and peoples. This has created a congenial climate in which the United Nations system can address some specific problems. Guns have fallen silent in the Gulf region  and the bloodletting entailed in the eight years of fierce fratricidal war between Iran and Iraq has finally ended. Bangladesh is proud to be a part of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group which today is helping keep the peace. We hope that direct negotiations between the parties will succeed in achieving a comprehensive  just and honourable settlement as envisaged in Security Council resolution 598 (1987) .In Afghanistan  the Soviet Union deserves to be praised for its commitment to the cause of peace  amply demonstrated by the withdrawal of its troops by 15 February this year. But the suffering of the Afghans has not ceased. Five million refugees  so generously hosted by Pakistan and Iran  have yet to return home. The people of Afghanistan has yet to exercise its inherent right to a system and Government of its choice. The United Nations co-ordinating role must be strengthened in the repatriation of the refugees  the reconstruction of the war-battered country  and the channelling of humanitarian assistance  and in the facilitating of a comprehensive  peaceful settlement in accordance with the Geneva Agreement.In Cambodia  Viet Nam's offer to withdraw its troops by 30 September  the Jakarta Informal Meeting negotiations  the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General and all the parties to the Paris Peace Conference have given rise to a hope for an imminent breakthrough. The recent set-back in Paris must not be allowed to reverse the process. Urgent new attempts need to be made to allow the people of Cambodia freely to determine its own future.In Namibia  the dawn of freedom is about to break. Its independence has always been a priority item on the United Nations agenda. Bangladesh's total identity with and support for the struggle of the Namibian people have been unswerving. We have been an active participant in the Council for Namibia. As I speak  our soldiers and civilians are on the soil of Namibia as an integral part of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. The leader of our military observer groups died in Namibia in a tragic accident in the performance of his duties. His supreme sacrifice will be vindicated when the yoke of suppression is lifted forever from Namibia. If need be  the United Nations must provide the Secretary-General with the total resources he requires to bring his efforts to fruition.In divided Cyprus  we welcome the initiation of talks between the two communities without pre-conditions with a view to reaching a negotiated settlement. We hope that the manifest differences will be narrowed. We hope that the contacts between the two Koreas will lead to a reconciliation and a peaceful solution in accordance with the aspirations of the people of that peninsula. In our own region  South Asia  the fourth summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Islamabad in December last year successfully fulfilled its essential mandate in enhancing and consolidating socio-economic co-operation in many new and meaningful directions.Sadly  some problems remain intractable. In the Middle East  Israel's continued occupation of illegally acquired territories has created an explosive situation. The valiant intifadah of the Palestinian people today serves as a clarion call to mobilize world public opinion against a brutal suppression of freedom. Israel must give up all the Arab territories  including the Golan Heights  that it so wrongly holds. We reiterate our support for the early convening of an international peace conference  of which the Palestine Liberation Organization must be an equal and integral part. The problem of Palestine is at the heart of the Middle East crisis and its resolution is a sine qua non for peace in the area.The hateful system of apartheid continues to bleed South Africa. The pain of the black majority grows more excruciating as thousands  including Nelson Mandela  continue to languish in prison. If Pretoria wishes to attempt to practice what it has now begun to preach  these thousands must be set free and apartheid must be dismantled. The path to freedom may be long  but for the South Africans the journey has begun. Bangladesh endorses the need for sustained support to the front-line States. We endorse the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against the racist regime.Disarmament remains  as always  in the forefront of our agenda. The Treaty on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles has been a historic step forward. A vital follow-up should be the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons by at least 50 per cent and significant cut-backs in conventional forces. As for Bangladesh  a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  we are constitutionally committed to the goal of general and complete disarmament. We believe  while nuclear disarmament is a priority item  a restraint in conventional arms is both urgent and necessary. We must continue to work towards a comprehensive test ban treaty. The United Nations role in monitoring compliance and verification must be strengthened. Naval arms limitation must be resolutely pursued. A convention on the non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States should be concluded. Of vital importance is the need to strengthen security assurances  both positive and negative  to non-nuclear-weapon States. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones across the globe should be encouraged. We must avoid the urge to make weaponry more sophisticated and thus improve its precision and accuracy and increase its propensity for use.There is a widespread acknowledgement today of the pressing and urgent need for a convention banning chemical weapons. Important progress in the Conference on Disarmament at its summer session must be pushed to an early conclusion. The Paris Conference and the just concluded meeting in Canberra will certainly supplement pressure to that end. The decision to expand the Conference on Disarmament should be given effect. On the question of the Indian Ocean  we firmly believe that the Ad Hoc Committee should speed up preparatory work so that the Conference can be held in Colombo next year.After years of ignoring alarm signals  concern over environment has new altered deep into our consciousness. The litany of causes and consequences has now become the jargon of everyday mass media usage. Concerns are growing on the depletion of the ozone layer  global warming  greenhouse effect  sea-level rise  acid rain  toxic waste  desertification and deforestation. Affixing blame is an inevitable fall-out. We must not  however  run the risk of being detracted from our goals to protect our planet. The point must not elude us that poverty and environmental degradation are inextricably linked. The proposed United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992 should be able to draw up a blue-print for combined action  taking due note of the development aspects of the environmental problems. I wish to underscore the call of the Non-Aligned Summit based on the proposal of our President  Hussain Muhammad Ershad  in Belgrade  for an international convention on protection and conservation of global climate. We hope for follow-up action in this Assembly.Today we are confronted with some social ills that have assumed gigantic proportions. Drugs have invaded our communities and homes  imperilling our societies  our national economies and even international peace and security. Terrorism and mindless violence strike at the very foundations of our society. We believe that only under the central management of the United Nations can we rally together for effective counteraction. This would mean an expanded role for the United Nations system  a role which has become both appropriate and relevant  and will  I am convinced  be performed with vigour and determination.The Secretary-General has underscored the ""social mission"" of the United Nations. All our efforts to achieve economic growth would be meaningless if social aspects of development were ignored. High rate of population growth  low literacy  lack of primary health care and safe drinking water  malnutrition  high infant mortality rate - all seriously affect the process of development and even have wider implications for the stability of international relations. Integrally linked with these issues is the need for improvements for vulnerable components of our societies - women  children  the aged and handicapped. In recent years  the United Nations has been the catalyst for international action in this area  and it should promote a global social strategy. In this context  we look forward to the adoption of the long-awaited United Nations convention on the rights of the child by this session of the Assembly. The proposed world summit on children is another commendable initiative that should receive the whole-hearted support of us all.In the final analysis  all our efforts are directed towards improving intrinsic human worth. The contribution of the United Nations has been to draw up the rules that constitute human rights and give them authoritative definition. The task today is to translate them into reality. The dilemma is to keep pace with rising expectations along a broad and complex range of fronts. To many Member States like us  the right to development is inalienable and deserves topmost priority. It is unacceptable to us that  when over a billion people live on the bare margins of existence  any other right can take priority over the amelioration of their condition.We must take full advantage of the potential of multilateral co-operation in order to assure a better future. The United Nations is the most universal focal point for such co-operation. To the founding fathers of this world body  the prevention of another global conflagration was the primary objective. Today  in a changed world situation  socio-economic under development poses an even greater threat to our societies. As the Secretary-General has said in his report this year  the progress we have achieved in the global political climate can prove precarious if the economic climate remains adverse for the majority of the world's population. Environmental degradation on a global scale is another related area of great concern to all of us. The focus of the United Nations in the coming decade should therefore appropriately be directed to these areas. We believe that any issue that affects humankind as a whole should receive priority attention by the Organization. That would not only make the United Nations more relevant and dynamic; through understanding and co-operation  this complex world would be a better place in which to live.This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of Bangladesh's admission to the United Nations. We are proud to be a part of this world forum. In reaffirming our total commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter  we are governed by the vision it conjures of a peaceful and secure world where people can pursue without hindrance or coercion the objective of a fulfilling and acceptable quality of life  consistent with human dignity in larger freedom. In his address at its fortieth anniversary session  President Hussain Muhammad Ershad very eloquently charted the role of the United Nations as being an organization in which ""the deepest aspirations of mankind can be fulfilled""."
"14",670,"BGR",44,1989,"ï»¿I have the honour to congratulate you  Sir  the representative of friendly Nigeria  upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session and to wish you every success in your responsible task. I should also like to thank Mr. Dante Caputo  the President of the forty-third session  for his contribution to its successful work.The world is entering a new stage of its development. The recognition of universal human interests has the effect of bringing closer together foreign policy criteria and values. I will permit myself the liberty of quoting from a statement by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar:""We will soon be entering a new decade. This  of course  means little by itself but not many decades can have opened at truly historic points. The present is such a point. There is a ubiquitous desire to turn over a new leaf  to try innovative approaches for the solution of old problems ... it is the combat against the causes of conflict  the struggle against economic inequities  and social evils and the degradation of the environment that must evoke all the courage and determination of battle."" (A/44/1  p. 28) In our changing world the sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations are increasingly becoming key events in international affairs. The political pulse of our planet  the positive trends in the international arena  can truly be sensed in the broad spectrum of ideas put forward from this rostrum. The statements of President Bush and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze are striking proof of the consolidation of peaceful coexistence  of the fact that confrontation is going out of fashion  and of the fact that positive dialogue is becoming a real factor in politics. We warmly welcome the new initiatives aid proposals of the two great Powers and the agreement reached to hold a new Soviet-American summit meeting.The objective laws of social development are creating a new understanding of the dialectics of the national and the international in international affairs. Among the factors of decisive significance for the changes that have occurred or are expected to occur  I would like particularly to highlight the realization that violence and hostility are futile and the banishing of the stereotypes of rivalry and confrontation. Capitalism and socialism are no longer regarded as irreconcilable opposites. The perestroika that is under way in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is generating new political thinking in response to the new historical circumstances.In fact  the search for new and innovative solutions to world problems is now taking place in all corners of the world and at all levels.Bulgaria is a small country  not one of those which set the pace of world development. However  very profound transformations are taking place in our country in keeping with the new spirit in relations among States and peoples. I refer here to the changes designed to enhance the role of the individual in society  the radical changes in conditions of economic activity  the comprehensive strengthening of the legal foundations of the State and the democratisation of all spheres of public life.We are aware that this is vital not only to the stability and well-being of the people  but also to our full-blooded interaction with the rest of the world  to Bulgaria's place in the community of States and peoples. The Bulgarian Parliament recently adopted a number of significant amendments to legislation guaranteeing the right of every Bulgarian to travel freely  stay abroad and return to the country. A decision has also been taken requiring the respective administrative  economic and other institutions to continue  as in the past  to take the necessary measures for the strict observance of the Constitution and those laws of the land that guarantee the freedom of conscience and belief of all citizens and of their customs and rites  for enhancing the national role and functions of the Bulgarian language as the language of State and for tolerance and respect for the free use of various dialects and languages in everyday communications between people. A step in that direction is the measures adopted in respect to health care that facilitate the performance of the rites of the follows of Islam and Judaism. That fully corresponds to the generally accepted international norms  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and the Vienna commitments.The restructuring of international relations on the principles of common sense end universal human interests depends above all on the international community's ability to eliminate the threat to its own destruction.The essence of the problem lies in the demilitarisation of political thinking. We believe that the time has come to abandon the model of military-strategic deterrence and to adopt one based on a comprehensive approach to the problems of peace and security. I should like to emphasize that the prestige aid mechanisms of the United Nations can play an invaluable part in the creation of that model.We are convinced of the need for the complete elimination of all nuclear armaments  as proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev in January 1986. We are also convinced of the need to reduce conventional weapons to the limits of reasonable sufficiency. All States must make a concerted effort to attain that goal. Aware of that necessity  Bulgaria  together with its allies  has undertaken unilateral reductions of its armed forces and military spending. We believe that this is a constructive contribution on our part.We are pleased with the reports that progress has been made in the talks on an agreement to reduce arsenals of strategic offensive weapons by 50 per cent. It is becoming increasingly clear that restraint is required in order to achieve progress in disarmament. It is also becoming obvious that plans for the modernization  development and deployment of new systems and types of nuclear and space weapons need to be reassessed.I should like to stress once again that the halting of the arms race and especially of the nuclear arms race should become the concern and responsibility of all mankind. That is why we should not regard bilateral negotiations as an alternative to multilateral efforts in that field.The Charter of the United Nations encourages regional measures for strengthening peace and security. The discussion on the question of nuclear-weapon-free zones has been going on for quite some time. Bulgaria is working actively to that end. Together with other neighbouring States  it has put forward concrete initiatives concerning the implementation of that idea on the Balkan peninsula.The world is closely approaching the completion of one of the top-priority tasks related to diminishing the threat of war. The Paris Conference of January 1989 demonstrated the existence of a broad international consensus on theprohibition and elimination of chemical weapons. We trust that the readiness expressed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America to initiate substantial chemical weapons reductions will accelerate the Geneva multilateral negotiations.Reducing conventional forces and limiting and eliminating tactical nuclear weapons in Europe would be a significant step towards security at a lower level of military confrontation. At the present Vienna negotiations  in contrast to the recent past  both the East aid the West are listening carefully to each other  raising hopes for speedy progress.Although it is too early to judge when the concrete results will come  we can safely say that things have already changed for the better. In Europe  where the competition between the two military alliances has left the most substantial traces  a new consciousness is now taking shape. The common European home is already regarded as an attainable goal. The Vienna Conference  the London Information Forum  and the Paris Conference on the Human Dimension are all important landmarks on the road to that goal. Bulgaria is determined to continue to make its own constructive contribution to the strengthening of the European process.Positive changes can be seen at the regional level. The chain reaction of efforts to resolve conflict situations has encompassed nearly all hot-beds of tension. The preference given to peaceful approaches is to a large degree determined by the search for a balance of interests on the basis of realism and compromise. The Belgrade Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries demonstrated the search for new and more efficient ways to achieve stabilization  peace and progress. There is a growing conviction that non-confrontational solutions can be found to even the most complex problems. We are on the eve of the proclamation of Namibia's independence. That is a most outstanding success in the decolonisation process of recent years.However  the peace-making process has not yet become irreversible. Civilian population centres in Afghanistan continue to come under missile attacks. The Palestinian people remains deprived of its right to its own State  and the occupation of Arab territories persists. There is no end to the fratricidal war in Lebanon. The spectres of genocide in Cambodia aid of apartheid in southern Africa continue to stalk. The regional peace process in Central America is far from immune to foreign interference. For a decade aid a half now the people of Cyprus has borne the burden of Turkish military occupation. The Korean people's dream of democratic rectification of its country  of demilitarising and ridding the region of all nuclear weapons  has still not materialized.Regrettably  we can extend that list of concerns much further. Still  in our view the most important thing is that the international community no longer views these conflicts in the narrow context of East-West confrontation  but rather as calamities for all mankind  calamities that must be overcome through joint efforts.As a State located in the centre of the Balkan peninsula  the People's Republic of Bulgaria has been pursuing an active policy of good-neighbourliness and mutual understanding  of detente aid the development of co-operation with all Balkan States in the spirit of the new political thinking and in line with what has been achieved so far in the European process.We note with satisfaction that Balkan co-operation is gathering momentum and having a positive impact on the situation in that part of the world. Results have been achieved in the political and economic spheres and steps are being taken to protect the environment. The first meeting on measures for strengthening confidence and security in the region has already been held.At the same time  in the Balkans - as  indeed  everywhere else - there are problems that still need to be resolved. We are  however  against making those problems serve to the detriment of bilateral and multilateral co-operation in the region. Our country has repeatedly stated that there is no problem that cannot be resolved at the negotiating table through equal and mutually advantageous dialogue free from pre-conditions  a dialogue unburdened by threats  by attempts to exert pressure for propaganda purposes and by interference in the internal affairs of the other country.That is also the view of the People's Republic of Bulgaria with regard to the problems of Bulgarian-Turkish relations  in which  regrettably  tensions have arisen. I take this opportunity to state once again that the Bulgarian side has always demonstrated its readiness to hold direct bilateral talks at any level to examine such current problems as the strengthening of confidence and security  the activation of bilateral economic relations; the resolution of humanitarian issues  including the reuniting of divided families; the adoption of organizational measures related to the travel of persons across the Bulgarian-Turkish border and so forth. At the same time  we shall continue to take into consideration the measures concerning the travel of people across the Bulgarian-Turkish border that Turkey  as a sovereign State  has enforced.We believe that the Bulgarian-Turkish Protocol signed at Belgrade last year has laid a solid foundation for discussing and resolving all the issues between the States. Our experience shows that the successful course of that dialogue can e facilitated by third countries if they adopt a favourable attitude. We are in favour of human and civilized relations between the People's Republic of Bulgaria id the Republic of Turkey  in keeping with contemporary trends in the development - international relations. In that connection I should like to quote from a statement made by the President of the State Council of the People's Republic of Bulgaria  Todor Zhivkov  on 29 Way 1989:""Both the present and the future of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Turkey lie in normal good-neighbourly relations between them and in the Balkans  in understanding and co-operation between all countries in the world. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has always pursued this goal and will continue to do so in the future.""The global processes developing in our world confront States with problems whose solution requires joint decisions. Those decisions will to a large degree determine the survival and advancement of mankind. Their natural basis lies in the v; rid economy and international economic relations. That is an obvious fact.The economy is a pre-condition for the functioning of every society and system for their well-being and security. That is why the problems of international economic development and co-operation are occupying an ever-more-prominent position in United Nations activities. Our experience of the 1930s has shown the need to unite the efforts of the international community in the search for new and more effective means of overcoming the critical condition of the economic growth and foreign indebtedness of the developing countries. The chronic problems in that at a not only destabilize international co-operation but also endanger international peace and security.The United Nations has sufficient intellectual potential and appropriate  mechanism for stimulating international economic interaction. It is in a position to make a significant contribution to the democratisation of world economic co-operation and its optimisation on the basis of mutual advantage. An especially important role in attaining that goal will be played by the releasing of enormous resources as a result of disarmament.Bulgaria is pursuing a consistent policy designed to develop bilateral and multilateral economic co-operation. One of the aims of the reforms we are carrying out is to enable us to enter into international economic structures. One concrete manifestation of that policy is the steps we have taken to establish official  stable and equitable relations with the European Economic Community (EEC) and to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).A priority sphere for uniting the efforts and resources of mankind is the preservation of the natural environment; we are hearing warnings about its degradation from political leaders and scientists  and it is being discussed by virtually everyone with equal concern. Bulgaria's ecological policy is being pursued in harmony with our strategy for the country's social aid economic development. It is reflected in the National Programme on the Conservation and Reproduction of the Natural Environment.Preparatory work on a Baikal ecological-protection treaty is being conducted on our initiative and in close co-operation with the other Balkan States. A session of the executive body of the Convention on Transboundary Air Pollution was held at Sofia last autumn under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Europe. An international meeting on the ecology will be held this month pursuant to a decision of the Vienna meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). We hope that the joint efforts of all States participating in that forum will encourage international co-operation in the field of ecology. Internationally  the principles upon which our position is founded are the free transfer of ecologically safe technologies  the abandonment of discriminatory restrictions in the implementation of projects for the protection of the environment  financial concessions to the developing countries in the trade in modern technologies  and broader technological assistance by developed States  including in the area of industrial co-operation and information.To the list of issues of universal human significance there is every reason to add the excesses of social pathology that are threatening the very foundations of society and the physical life of the individual - such excesses as terrorism  drug abuse and organized crime.Terrorism is of special danger to social and international stability in conditions of growing world interdependence. It is our view that that phenomenon is the result and outgrowth of those social conditions and types of thinking that for centuries have engendered militarism  hatred and the desire to eliminate those regarded as unsuitable. In all its forms modern terrorism is a crime and deeply reactionary. Our country's position with respect to terrorism is unequivocal and firm. There is no objective that can justify the murder of innocent civilians  the taking of hostages or the physical and moral humiliation of the human being.The success of the new approaches to solving the problems of the modern world would be unthinkable without the primacy of law in international affairs. The security of our world should above all be built on the foundations of the stable and just rule of law. The primacy of law is the only true guarantee of the priority of universal human values over narrow and biased scheming of an ideological and nationalist character. The rule of force should give way to the rule of law in civilized legal processes in an atmosphere of peaceful and Interdependent coexistence.This session of the General Assembly is being held at an exceptionally decisive moment. Today  more than ever before  nations of the world have strong expectations of seeing peaceful aid equitable relations established  of a future world of security and development  and of the harmonious coexistence of man and nature.Please allow me to express my country's hope that now  when the role of the United Nations in international affairs has grown perceptibly  this session will make a substantial contribution to the further broadening of dialogue between States for the sake of establishing a new world order based on sound reason  security and co-operation."
"15",715,"BHR",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me pleasure to start by congratulating Ambassador Garba of Nigeria on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session and wishing him success in directing its proceedings. I should also like to convey our thanks and appreciation to Mr. Dante Caputo who  as President of the Assembly at its forty-third session  guided our proceedings with admirable efficiency.I cannot fail to refer in that respect to the annual report of the Secretary-General on the work of the organization as a complete record of the issues and topics competently addressed by the United Nations since the forty-third session. I avail myself of this opportunity to express our utmost appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the prominent role he has assumed in this regard and for his unrelenting efforts to promote the role of the organization in the maintenance of peace and security and in the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations Charter.This session convenes in an atmosphere of international detente characterized by a spirit of dialogue  the building of bridges of trust and co-operation among States and the solution of international problems by peaceful means rather than by confrontation and resorting to the use of force. during the past two years  the world has witnessed an energetic move towards resolving some of the chronic regional conflicts which  for many years  have been a source of concern to the international community. We also witnessed a collective tendency towards strengthening the role of the United Nations in controlling the hotbeds of tension in several critical areas of the world.At the beginning of this month leaders of the non-aligned countries met in Belgrade to examine and assess the international situation and to discuss the latest developments on the road to peaceful coexistence  the coexistence which constitutes the main objective of the Movement. The wills of the Member States of the Movement converged on the need to improve the methods for dealing with international problems  in order to keep pace with the latest developments that have taken place on the world scene  and to devise a unified conception of an integrated strategy for a future in which co-operation in all fields will prevail.The lessons of history and the experiences of the past have proved to us that preserving the vitality of the role of the United Nations in the area of international co-operation must remain a fundamental constant in our changing world. That is because we live in a world where boundaries overlap and interests and relationships intertwine to such an extent that it is impossible for any individual State  no matter how powerful or how great its potential  to isolate itself within its own boundaries and solve its problems alone and apart from the outside world.The improvement we are witnessing in the relations between the two major blocs confirms our conviction that differences in political philosophies and ideologies should not impede the accommodation of different interests  nor should they hamper co-operation between States with different political and socio-economic systems.Proceeding from this perspective it can be said that the decade of the nineties heralds drastic changes in the course of international relations  as well as positive trends and constructive steps to develop the concept of collective security  a concept which once was only a vision in the minds of the architects of the Charter. Such new changes and trends would  in turn  develop multilateral international co-operation in the coming years for the promotion and advancement of the international community to the benefit of mankind and human civilization as a whole.During the 1980s  the United Nations has had to tackle various global political  economic and social problems. The United Nations fulfilled the tasks entrusted to it and has been able to adjust to this changing world. It has thus asserted its credibility and ensured its future viability. The extent of the change in the working methods of the Organization in response to new developments on the world scene becomes evident from even a quick glance it the items on the agenda of successive sessions of the General Assembly.. However  the criterion for measuring its success in carrying out its future responsibilities will no doubt be decided by how much it can absorb the facts of the new era and conform to them in order to address the issues of the environment - poverty  famine  disease and natural disasters.It goes without saying that the United Nations cannot carry out these vital tasks without the contribution of every State towards finding an appropriate formula for achieving interdependence among nations in a new world where the human race is perceived as an indivisible whole.Allow me in this context to concentrate on three main issues which we feel should be dealt with seriously and effectively. The issues should be given close attention by the United Nations so that appropriate solutions may be found to them. The first such issue is the promotion of peace and security in the world. Progress achieved in the peaceful solution of certain regional conflicts has aroused a feeling of optimism in the international community  a feeling which often leads us to believe that real possibilities for finding just and lasting solutions to the pending international problems do exist. However  when it comes to the question of Palestine  such hopes dissipate as Israel reveals its true intentions about peace.Over the four decades since its founding  Israel's talk of peace has remained one of many empty slogans   since its response to Arab peace initiatives was invariably to consolidate its occupation  refine its methods of oppression and intimidation of the Palestinian people  demean their dignity and violate their human rights. Then came the heroic intifadah which wore out the Zionist entity. Having despaired of suppressing it  Israel believes that by sowing dissension in the Palestinian ranks and by absorbing international pressures through what it calls the Shamir election initiative  it can quell that intifadah. The awareness and steadfastness displayed by the Palestinians  however  came contrary to all Israeli expectations and accounts. The Palestine Liberation organization (PLO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  was able to face up to the Israeli manoeuvre by asserting wisely and objectively that free elections cannot be held under occupation  nor can they be held away from international supervision. Such elections should take place within the framework of a comprehensive peace process in which Israel declares its acceptance of the principle of ""land for peace"".At the core of the peace process in the Middle East is the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination in their own national soil and to establish their own independent State. It would be totally unjust to pay heed to the allegations advanced by Israel about the dangers inherent in establishing the Palestinian State  since such allegations are null and void and designed to help Israel overcome the dilemma of the intifadah in which it has been fumbling blindly for nearly two years.We therefore appeal to the General Assembly to call upon the Security Council to impose international legitimacy in accordance with General Assembly resolution 43/176  which defines the foundations of a just peace between all parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict as well as urgently convening the international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations as the appropriate vehicle for finding a realistic solution to the Middle East problem.In the interest of establishing a just and lasting peace in the Gulf area  the State of Bahrain since the very beginning welcomed the cease-fire between Iraq and Iran and the commencement of negotiations between them under the auspices of the United Nations. While supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at conciliating the viewpoints of both parties and narrowing their differences  we are hopeful that both countries will be able to arrive at a formula for a durable  comprehensive and just peace between them through the implementation of Security Council resolution 593 (1987) in all its provisions  since that resolution is a comprehensive peace plan  as well as by adherence to the principles of good neighbourliness  non-interference in internal affairs of other countries and the establishment of relations on the basis of mutual trust and respect.regarding the Lebanese crisis  15 years of a bloody strife have failed to ensure security or stability for Lebanon. They have convinced all Lebanese factions of the necessity of finding through dialogue a peaceful solution that will achieve national accord in order to ensure the country's future and preserve its unity free from all external interference. We therefore urge all people of good will and appeal to their conscience to support the efforts of the tripartite Arab high Committee. In welcoming the resumption of its efforts to end the Lebanese crisis we earnestly hope that all parties concerned will co-operate with the Committee in order to enable it to fulfil its task and that all parties will begin to implement its resolutions for the good of Lebanon and its people.The right to self-determination is organically linked to the question of promoting peace and security in southern Africa. We have followed with interest the efforts of the United Nations and the endeavours of its Secretary-General to implement Security Council resolution 43 5 (1978) on the independence of Namibia. We look forward to the day when an independent Namibia will take its place in this very Hall and we consider that to be one of the important achievements of the United Nations in its ceaseless quest to eliminate colonialism and support every people's struggle for freedom and national independence.Despite the positive and encouraging developments in southern Africa  the Pretoria regime continues to persist in its racist and inhuman policies. We therefore renew our call to the international community to continue its efforts aimed at completely eradicating the policies of apartheid in South Africa arid at the establishment of a democratic fraternal society in which freedom  justice  equality and respect for human rights prevail. As for the situation in Afghanistan  we hope that the United Nations will continue to utilize its capabilities and use its good offices to find a solution to the prevailing situation there that will enable the Afghan people to choose the political and social system acceptable to it  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly.It is regrettable also that the question of Cyprus remains unresolved and that the split between the two Cypriot communities continues to exist. In this regard I should like to reiterate Bahrain's support for the unity of Cyprus  its independence and non-aligned status. We hope that the bi-communal dialogue conducted under the auspices of the Secretary-General will make progress.We hope too that direct dialogue between the two parts of the Korean peninsula will improve relations between them and help realize the aspirations of the Korean people for a restoration of their national unity.The second issue  which is no less important than the first  is that of global development. It poses a major challenge to the international community in its persistent endeavour to lay the foundations of economic and social progress and improve the standards of living of people throughout the world  as envisaged in the Charter. The riches of our world are distributed very unevenly. In this era of the conquest of space and impressive scientific and technological advancement  it is no longer tolerable to find that poorer nations continue to struggle for survival under circumstances of extreme austerity which have already led to unstable political  economic and social conditions in them. Indeed it is distressing that more than one fourth of the world's population should lack adequate shelter and that 100 million people should be without shelter altogether. While demographic and social indicators can explain the magnitude of the tragedy in the countries of the third world  nevertheless it is underdevelopment that is the most complex and serious problem of our times.The international community is facing an acute crisis as a result  inter alia  of structural imbalances in the world economic orders the widening gap between the developed and developing countries  the majority of which is still suffering from external debt problems; deteriorating terms of trade  and unstable rates of exchange. These factors have combined to produce a negative phenomenon reflected in the reverse transfer of financial resources from developing to developed countries and a marked impasse in the North-South dialogue.Solving the debt crisis requires  in the first place  the elaboration of a new plan for the development of the third world and that creditor countries recognize the need of debtor nations to be able to negotiate collectively on the basis of an integrated programme to be developed following a realistic examination and through joint co-ordination  in order to bring about a more effective and global policy. The current international situation provides a propitious opportunity for the success of such an initiative. The present improvement in the international atmosphere must be exploited to give new impetus to multilateral co-operation so that feasible  permanent solutions to the third world debt crisis can be found.It is now widely recognized that  so long as the arms race continues  development cannot be fully achieved. Although the world has witnessed a rapid arms race during the previous three decades  present possibilities are promising: disarmament proposals  including initiatives for the reduction of conventional weapons  are being considered by the States members of both the North Atlantic Treaty organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. The success of such initiatives would surely be of great help in reducing tensions in Europe and in re-orienting international efforts towards comprehensive development programmes.While disarmament and arms reductions are prerequisites for development  economic integration is the most important element of its synergy and the most noticeable component of its success. Economic integration has become an important developmental necessity dictated by the demands of our times in the context of current world developments  and is one alternative for solving the economic problems of developing countries.We are living today in an era of major economic groupings based on a balancing of interests and interdependence. While most of the successful economic groupings today are composed of developed countries  it is the developing countries that are in dire need of such institutions to enable them to achieve economic integration and build societies of progress and prosperity for their peoples. The European Community was tine first to succeed in building the edifice of economic integration that will culminate in an economically united Europe in 1992. Similarly  the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) has  since its inception in 1981  followed the same course for achieving the integration of its six member States on their way to socio-economic unity.Stressing the importance of such regional co-operation  Shaikh Isa Bin Salman Al-Khalifa  the Amir of the State of Bahrain and Chairman of the current session of the GCC  has said  ""Developments in our contemporary world  together with the interrelationship of international interests and their continuous interaction with changing events  have dictated political  economic and social tendencies towards co-operation and integration within the various regional groups  leading them to unite their entities  thus keeping once with the march of time and the progress of the human race. It was from this premise that the Gulf Co-operation Council regarded as one of the most important  if not the most important  achievements of our region.""Since the signing of the Unified Economic agreement in 1981  the GCC States have taken steady steps toward economic integration through expanding the Gulf common market and accelerating economic development. The Manama Declaration issued by the ninth summit meeting of Bahrain held in December 1988  affirmed the determination of the States members of the Council to continue working jointly to attain the aspirations of their peoples. The Supreme Council also adopted a number of important resolutions which involved encouraging the establishment of joint industrial ventures  reinforcing the principle of Gulf citizenship  permitting the citizens of GCC States to own shares in the joint stock companies active in the economic field  and equal tax treatment for citizens of all GCC States in the area of investments.This year has also witnessed the birth of two other similar organizations: the Council for Arab Co-operation and the Arab Maghreb Union. The GCC welcomed the establishment of both of these new Arab groupings as a qualitative and essential development strengthening relations between the States members of the League of Arab States and as a channel for natural communication between them and the United Nations with a view to achieving the regional development that the Charter encourages. We are certain that the three Arab groupings will effectively endeavour to evolve co-operation at the regional level and promote the process of economic integration  thus contributing to the welfare and prosperity of the Arab region.The phenomenon of the spread of narcotic drugs has become a factor impeding progress and undermining the very foundations of societies  particularly through its devastating effects on young people  who are an important pillar of development. Islam has fought the abuse of narcotics and banned their use for all but scientific and medical purposes. Thus  our Islamic jurisprudence (Shari'a) has provided us with an invincible bastion of ethical values that has limited the spread of this phenomenon in our societies.Despite the fact that more than 30 years have elapsed since the launching of the international campaign against the abuse of narcotic drugs  this problem is still with us  albeit in varying degrees of severity from country to country. The whole world today is organizing concerted efforts and intensive campaigns against drug addiction and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs  which are destructive activities and a crime against humanity as a whole. In accordance with the teachings of our Islamic religion  the State of Bahrain has given its maximum attention to avoiding the spread of narcotic drugs and drug addiction within its boundaries  and has promulgated a series of laws to prohibit the use of  addiction to and circulation of narcotics and illicit trafficking in them.Proceeding from our keen desire to contribute to the international campaign against the abuse of narcotic drugs  and in support of international co-operation for eradicating this dangerous phenomenon which affects various cross-sect ions and groups of human society  the State of Bahrain has decided to accede to the following conventions: the Single Convention on narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol; the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971; and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 - which we signed yesterday.The third issue  the environment  is closely linked to the previous issue  since development and the environment are indivisible. Today  I do not think there can be any disagreement on the importance of preserving the mechanisms that ensure the renewal of the biosphere in order to protect the future of humanity. The problems of air pollution  desertification  the transfer of wastes  pollution of the seas and oceans  the depletion of the ozone layer  and other problems  are at the forefront of the list of international concerns owing to their negative impact on humanity's present and future.The world today has reached a stage where some economic development programmes are threatening the environment with irreparable damage. Such damage could even endanger the elements themselves and the balance of nature's cycle on which the very survival of planet Earth depends.Our view of the world we live in has undergone a conspicuous transformation. It is a view of ceaselessly evolving and constantly changing world. This vision requires a new international strategy for development governed by the principle of the imperative of concordance and harmony between the objectives of development and the requirements for preserving the environment  a strategy that would serve mankind without endangering its fate.Thus  environmental preservation is no longer limited to merely selecting appropriate methods to deal with certain accidents or to adopting a series of measures designed to deal with each case separately  but calls for an approach which seeks to eliminate the contradictions between the rationale behind the strategies for economic development and that which governs the policies for preserving the environment.Hence we welcome the initiatives put forward in this respect  particularly the proposals of the committee presided over by Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland  Prime Minister of Norway. We believe that those proposals constitute a good basis for revitalizing international co-operation in this field and for intensifying efforts with a view to finding an approach which would ensure safe development.In this regard  we also support the convening  in 1992  of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development to deal with the major issues facing our contemporary world in the context of social and economic development  as well as the implementation of the recommendations of the Global Committee on the Environment and Development  and the Environmental Perspective to the year 2000 and beyond  in addition to formulating a programme for future activities in this vital area.The international community is at present undergoing a process of radical transformation  a process which will be reflected  in one way or another  in the components of the existing world order. A characteristic of such historical transformation is the presence of thesis and anti-thesis  the synthesis of which would help to make progress. Consequently  the future of the world is dependent upon the stability of the process of confidence-building among nations and upon how deeply rooted are the yearnings for the unity of human fate in the face of major challenges  foremost among which are the strengthening of peace  the promotion ofdevelopment and the preservation of the environment.As a focal point for international action  the United Nations must  at this important phase in the history of mankind  evolve its role in order to achieve the common objectives which are dictated by mutual interests. It must endeavour to restore the unity of humankind in all its aspects  so as to overcome the narrow self-interests of States and provide for the role of the human being in rehabilitating this Earth and preserving its civilization.We need not recall today that we stand at the threshold of the twenty-first century  with the responsibilities and obligations that implies. This should prompt us to close ranks around our Organization to ensure that it proceeds towards bright prospects and a prosperous future for coming generations."
"16",753,"BHS",44,1989,"ï»¿I am happy warmly to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the Presidency. The Bahamas is confident that your vast experience and reputation as an outstanding diplomat will greatly facilitate your work at this session and enhance its success. May I also express deep appreciation to your predecessor# Mr. Dante Caputo# the former Foreign Minister of Argentina# for the exceptional way in which he presided over our deliberations at the forty-third session.Our Secretary-General has always been an untiring champion of peace  and of the success which we have realized since our last session was due to his expert leadership. The Bahamas warmly congratulates him for his outstanding efforts over the past year.Î£ address this body only two short weeks after hurricane Hugo unleashed a mighty fury against our neighbours in the eastern Caribbean and along the south-east border of our host country. I wish on behalf of the Government and people of the Bahamas to record our special sympathy to those countries which suffered tremendous human and financial loss o We call on the international community to consider every possible assistance particularly to those small Caribbean States that have suffered overwhelming damage to the very foundation of their economic existence.It is now 1989  the final rear of the decade of the 1980s. We are at a significant crossroads in human affairs  at which we must both reflect on the successes and the frustrations of the 1980s and look forward optimistically to the challenges of the 1990s. There is justification for optimism  no matter how limited or qualified. It became evident during the forty-third session of the Assembly that a new era of hope and co-operation had dawned and inspired new enthusiasm for the relevance of our Organization. With this new era of hope has also come renewed prestige  renewed credibility and a greater commitment to efficiency at the united Nations. The lessening of tensions between the super-Powers and the continued international strides towards the reduction in military arsenals in Europe are further causes for our renewed optimism.There has been progress and/or intensified efforts in negotiations that could lead to the peaceful resolution of disputes in Central America  Angola  Afghanistan and Kampuchea  and between Iran and Iraq. The Bahamas applauds the progress made in Namibia and looks forward to welcoming it into the community of nations.Another significant success to the new international Convention against the traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances  adopted in December 1988. Our Organization also received formal accolades on 29 September 1988  when it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for peace-keeping. Since then  two new united Nations forces have been dispatched to monitor cease-fire agreements in Afghanistan and on the Iran-Iraq border'. Another peace-keeping force has been organized for Namibia  and now a verification mission for Central America is being planned. Those laudable achievements notwithstanding  the world community continues to encounter frustrations. Consequently  our Organization's agenda is constantly expanding with corresponding demands on its already scarce resources.The proliferation of nuclear weapons threatens global annihilation. Furthermore  recourse to conventional weapons also restricts already limited resources for social welfare  especially in a majority of developing countries. It is therefore incumbent upon responsible Governments to apply qualitative measures on the political factors that determine their armament policies.The Bahamas as among those States that were disappointed that greater progress was not possible at the last session of the Disarmament Commission. The Bahamas nevertheless embraces the small progress made  and hopes that this step-by-step approach will beat greater fruit in the future. For this reason the Bahamas has joined those States calling for the convening of an amendment conference to convert the existing partial test-ban treaty into a comprehensive test-ban treaty  and welcomes the fourth  conference scheduled for 1990  The Bahamas is encouraged by the statements made in this debate by the President of the United States of America and the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union with respect to chemical weapons and hopes that the International community will lend the necessary support for the total eradication of those weapons  which have such devastating and indiscriminate effects.Many nations continue to be saddled with serious economic problems and consequently must tackle the threat of poverty  restrictive protectionism  the staggering debt burden and falling commodity prices  The current state of the world economy clearly demonstrates the urgent need for dialogue and an integrated approach to solving problems between North and South which would allow developing countries to adjust to development.The Bahamas  therefore  hopes for the success of the upcoming special session oÂ£ the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation. The special session can provide us with the opportunity to take stock of the changes that have taken place in the l990s as we seek agreement on the principles that should guide us into the 1990s and beyond. This will ensure a comprehensive and practical international development strategy for the fourth Development Decade. The Bahamas would wish to see the international development strategy address the social consequences of the present negative economic environment.In particular  we believe that the United Nations should undertake a direct and comprehensive examination of the plight of millions of people in the developing world  who  because of poverty and hunger  are obliged to risk their very lives seeking to meet the bare necessities for survival in foreign countries. For the most part  the exodus is from one developing country to another. These people fall between the cracks of the Office of the united nations High Commissioner for Refugees and migrant-worker agreements. The assistance afforded to political refugees is not available to those migrating for economic reasons. Neither can the countries in which they arrive look to the international community to alleviate the economic and social burdens which such migration imposes. There is an urgent need for the international community to address this critical issue. To the extent possible  the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade should contain concrete co-operative measures to assist those obliged to migrate for economic reasons and those developing countries which must confront this problem. Now I wish to call attention to the plight of our Caribbean neighbour  the Republic of Haiti  whose people are Involved in a valiant struggle to free themselves from centuries of economic and social deprivation while at the same time seeking to build the democratic institutions necessary for greater stability. It is particularly urgent  then  that international organizations and donor countries give support to the aspirations of the Haitian people by restoring and increasing technical and financial assistance to that nation.With respect to Central America we are encouraged by the commitment of those regional Governments to seek a firm and lasting peace in the region  as demonstrated by the Tela Declaration of 7 August 1989. The Bahamas calls on all States to refrain from any activity that could or would frustrate those peace efforts and/or exacerbate the conflict. We are particularly mindful that  while the region must solve Its own problems free from the threat of external Interference  the International community should also lend every possible assistance and moral and material support to the peace process and provide essential economic and to those ravaged by years of war.My Government wishes to record Its solidarity with the Panamanian people in their efforts to Install a democratically elected Government in the Republic of Panama. The Bahamas strongly endorses the statement of the Organization of American States that the solution to the Panamanian problem is the exclusive province of the Panamanians  but also that in the solution to the Panamanian crisis the observance of democratic principles oust be ensured in the free exercise of the sovereignty and self-determination of the Panamanian people.Indeed  the Bahamas reaffirms the right of all States in our region to exist in peace and in secure boundaries. We call upon all to recognize and respect the sovereign territorial rights of all States in the region  including Belize and Guyana.Peace in the Middle East continues to elude us while the Bahamas reaffirms its support of Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised borders  it also reiterates its support for the right of Palestinians to their own State. The Palestinian question is but one element of the complex situation obtaining in the Middle East. The problems of Lebanon also beg solution.Participation in the community of nations necessarily implies  for its survival and good order  agreement with and support of the standards and principles enunciated by that community. As regards respect for human rights those standards are succinctly set out in the Charter of the United Nations and further elaborated in the universal Declaration of Human Rights. When a Government permits and commits violent acts and atrocities against its citizens its actions reverberate beyond national boundaries to challenge the most fundamental principles of the international community. The Bahamas agrees that in such circumstances human rights become a legitimate subject for international concern. Recourse for the citizens must then be to the community of nations.It is in connection with the violation of human rights that I now wish to address the situation in South Africa. While pleased at the progress made in Namibia and Angola  the Bahamas must express its deep concern that the system of apartheid still flourishes in South Africa. Moreover  the racially restricted political enfranchisement further attests to the abuses to which the South African Government continues to subject the majority of the people of South Africa.The Bahamas is convinced that the international community has not yet exhausted strategies to bring pressure to bear effectively on South Africa to dismantle apartheid. We therefore fully support the convening of the special session of the General Assembly m the policies of apartheid scheduled to take place in October. We share the view that the imposition of comprehensive sanctions is the most effective action available to the international community to force South Africa to bring an e\d to the abominable system of apartheid.The abuse of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances persist as one of the roost formidable challenges to mankind/ wreaking havoc on societies  disrupting economies and threatening the security of nations world-wide. Colossal efforts have been expended to stem the tide of the illicit drug trade yet it has not been arrested  nor has demand diminished.The Prime Minister of the Bahamas  the Right Honourable Sir Lynden 0. Pindling  In a statement to The Los Angeles Times's Washington Bureau on 28 September 19899 commenting on some of the possible reasons for this state of affairs  sand  Law enforcement turf wars have hindered the drug war  irresponsible politicians have selfishly politicised it and criminal cartels have been allowed to emerge to the point where they can challenge the authority of a democratically elected government with full-scale terrorism. As victims of a collective geography that traps them between the drug'-producer nations of the South and large consumer markets in the North  the Bahamas and its Caribbean neighbours have felt acutely the impact of the drug menace. Our Caribbean region ranks among the most trafficked transit routes for the illicit drug trade. The Prime Minister summed up the unique position of the Bahamas as a transit State  remarking We have our finger on the pulse of the drug trade  the methods and capabilities of the producers and demand and tactics of the consumers.  Moreover  as a transit State the Bahamas does not have the option of removing itself from this theatre of war. So we have stood and fought  sometimes alone sometimes in close co-operation with our neighbours. We are aware  however  that co-operative efforts yield best results and firmly subscribe to the principle of collective responsibility for con fronting the drug menace  which is increasingly recognised internationally.This principle is interwoven into the provisions of the recently adopted United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The Bahamas is proud to be the country to begin the process of ratification of that important instrument and has begun implementing the Convention in its national legislation and its bilateral  regional and international co-operative efforts. We urge all Governments signatories to the Convention to ratify it early so that it may be added to the international drug-control arsenal.The Bahamas recognises and consents the considerable efforts of the United Nations in the field of drug control  particularly its standard-setting efforts. The Bahamas is of the opinion  nevertheless  that the United Nations should boldly go further. As the Prime Minister of the Bahamas contended in his recent address:  The time has come for a multilateral force under the auspices of the United Nations to focus on the eradication of drugs and to assist countries that seek help on terms that they can accept. Given the rise of narco-terrorists and the paramilitary capability of producers to defend their opium  coca and marijuana fields  as well as production laboratories  there ought to be an international body to turn to for help. Surely many countries here have considered this option. Some  like the States of the Caribbean community on a Jamaican initiative  have articulated this possibility and have placed it on the international agenda. Clearly  the proposal poses both a challenge and a dilemma for  as the Prime Minister of the Bahamas recognized:  The political implications and consequences of outside military intervention against drug kingpins in producing nations places those Governments in the untenable position of having to choose between accepting the help of a friend in waging an effective eradication war against a deadly enemy and risking its political mandate to govern as drug gangs exploit nationalist sentiments against big-Power intervention. To mitigate the obvious difficulties that this dilemma engenders  the Prime Minister cautions that If troops are required  governments should have the sole right to determine the strength and composition of a multilateral force if they wish to deploy one alongside their own troops  as well as to determine the length and terms of the force's deploymentThe Prime Minister also visualized that a special eradication fund could be established to finance men and materiel  technical support  relocation assistance and or op-substitution programmes for local population in eradication zones. We recognize that the expertise and experience of the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control  and other United Nations drug-control bodies  and international agencies and organizations concerned with drug-abuse control would be invaluable to such a fund. The Prime Minister also envisages a narcotics enforcement support office at the United Nations  to augment  not replace  efforts of producing countries.The Bahamas commends those proposals for consideration - together with the proposal for an international criminal court to deal with drug-related crimes and other trans border criminal transgressions - confident that  if implemented  they would enhance the capacity of the system to confront the drug menace.In the same vein  the Bahamas in early 1988 joined its voice to that of the Congress of the United States of America  and of Colombia  in calling for a hemispheric meeting at the Heads of Government level to co-ordinate national responses to halt the drug traffickers in the Americas. The President of the United States has now endorsed that call for a meeting of Heads of Government of the countries most affected by the drug traffic. As a small State systematically victimized by the drug cartels and confronted with the consequences of the traffic and abuse of drugs  the Bahamas is  I believe  ideally placed to serve as a venue for a hemispheric conclave of Heads of State  and has so indicated to other beleaguered Governments of the region. We believe that a hemispheric summit would be the ideal forum for hammering out a multinational strategy for co-operation between States in enforcement  treatment  rehabilitation and demand-reduction efforts.The Bahamas would wish also to emphasize the importance of drug-demand-reduction strategies to the war against drugs  and in this regard urges fullest political support for the international conference on demand reduction which the United Kingdom proposes to convene in 1990.The Bahamas  though a small country  has played its role on the international stage. In the face of a hostile economic world environment  we have tried through conscious and deliberate national policy to create a country whose foundations are stability  prosperity and peace.The Bahamas is concerned about the continuing degradation of the world environ me Â· which if it remains unchecked  will threaten the very survival of the human species. Man-made pollutants ate having a profound negative effect on the environment  and the unchecked exploitation of the limited resources make depletion a very real probability. Additionally  the vagaries of natural disasters have wreaked havoc on the environment.We are especially concerned because the primary industries on which the Bahamas bases its economic development - tourism and the exploitation of marine resources - are dependent on a healthy environment. The Bahamas is in accord with the international community in its efforts to preserve the environment for future generations of mankind. The Bahamas  therefore  fully supports the second world conference on environment and development scheduled for 1992.1992 will also mark the quincentenary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. The terrible legacies of colonial domination of the original peoples of the Americas and the brutal aberration of slavery  which gave rise to cruelly unequal societies in the Americas  have rightfully stirred strong emotions within the community of nations. Those strong emotions  however  should not prevent us from recognizing the energy and thirst for knowledge which inspired Christopher Columbus and other nautical explorers in the fifteenth century. It is the belief of ray Government that the arrival of Christopher Columbus in this hemisphere  almost 500 years ago  at San Salvador in the Bahamas opened a new chapter of history  which resulted in the convergence of many worlds and many cultures. Today  proud independent countries of the Americas stand in testimony to the universality of mankind and its ability to transcend even the roost dire obstacles in order to create multiracial societies  unprecedented elsewhere in our world. The Bahamas will use the occasion of the quincentenary to reflect on the past  which it considers an invaluable guide for the future  and to celebrate the best of what we are and what we can yet achieve as peoples of the Americas.We have come as Member States to lay before the Organization our common problems  seeking common solutions. Yet  as we challenge the United Nations to be the important forum it needs to be  we find its capacity severely restricted by its precarious financial situation. While we call for a more effective role for the United Nations  Member States often demonstrate a lack of necessary political will  pleading either hardship or dissatisfaction. By so doing  many shirk their responsibilities which are critical to making the Organization financially viable and therefore effective. Political will is a factor not only at the level of finances  but also in the programmes and overall Ño-ordination of the United Nations system. Duplication of agendas and programming in various agencies has led to further demands on already-over-stretched resources. lack of flexibility and insistence on furthering national policies in absolute disregard for  and in many cases to the detriment of  other nations represent additional major obstacles to tine effective and efficient functioning of the United Nations.It is evident that the challenges posed by the issues I have highlighted can be properly addressed only by international collaboration and co-operation on a consistent basis. The successes achieved last year clearly demonstrate the value of multilateralism. It needs hardly be sand that the United Nations is best placed for such multilateral co-operation.The United Nations remains the most appropriate organ for the resolution of conflict and the solution of our global problems. The Bahamas  as in the past  gives our world body its total support  for it is the best hope for the peace and security of mankind. "
"17",825,"BLR",44,1989,"ï»¿Please accept  Sir  the congratulations of the delectation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are most appreciative of the activities of the Secretary-General and share the view he expressed in the report on the work of the Organization that:âThe United Nations needs to demonstrate its capacity to function as guardian of the world's security.  (A/44/1  p. 11).The United Nations emerged from the Second World War which was unleashed by fascism and militarism  which took advantage of the lack of unity among peace-loving forces and of the negative response of the European nations to the Soviet proposals for collective action against the aggressor. Our people took UP arms to defend the goals and principles of international relations which were later enshrined  with our participation  in the United Nations Charter. The members of the anti-Hitler coalition were fighting not only for their national interests  but also to bring freedom and independence to so many enslaved nations. We welcome the statements made during the general debate about the inviolability of cost-war borders in Europe.Fundamental changes have taken place in the world represented in the United Nations. These changes are most profound and radical and signify the end of the cold war and the dawning of an era of peace and mutual trust  the renunciation of propagandist  polemics and the initiation of a quest for specific bilateral and multilateral action to resolve existing problems by political means  drawing upon the prestige and potential of the United Nations.Clearly  the most important feature of these multi faceted features is the fact that they are not confined to narrow national interests of individual States. They are global in scale and thus call for a multilateral approach. Not only are these changes encouraging but they also call for a correct understanding of where they are leading the world. In conditions of freedom of choice and of pluralism of opinions based on the new political thinking  these changes also mean that we must further outline joint measures to achieve demilitarisation  democratization and the humanization of international contacts and to establish the primacy of law in relations among States.Over the past few years  we have all had a difficult oath to tread. Gone are the days when people saw everything in terms of black and whites when everyone believed that he alone was right; when socialism was made out to be the enemy rather than a partner in world affairs; when suspicion and mistrust repelled mutual tolerance and the natural desire of nations to live in peace and friendship with one another; when some would put forward proposals to strengthen peace and develop co-operation while others would reject them; and without even attempting to understand them; when universal human values were not taken into account. Without wishing to continue this review of an unhappy past  for which there are still those who remain nostalgic even today  I would point out that in our detailed  often heated and at times disrespectful  discussions  we  after all  did succeed in restoring and enriching  in United Nations resolutions and recommendations  the meaning of such key notions as international peace and security  disarmament  economic development  co-operation  decolonization  social justice  human rights and so forth.But it is too early to rest on our laurels. All this should be embodied in mandatory international legal instruments. In this context the next decade  which  will mark the end of the twentieth century and of the second millennium  will be decisive in terms of whether mankind succeeds in coping with new challenges and whether it will emerge victorious in the struggle for peace and well-being for everyone on this planet.We are preoccupied with the problems of eliminating the threat of war  bringing about disarmament  resolving regional conflicts  eliminating the vestiges of colonialism  ensuring development  social progress  observance of human rights  and the preservation of an ecological balance. It is being increasingly recognized that these problems have a direct bearing on the level of security and the quality of life of the peoples of the world.It would appear that today everyone understands that the use of military force  particularly nuclear force  with all its devastating consequences  has run its course. It is also clear that there can be no just settlement of regional conflicts through the use of military force. The new level of this understanding has led to important conceptual breakthroughs that have made it possible to conclude and implement the first ever agreement on the actual elimination of a portion of nuclear arsenals of Soviet and United States medium- and shorter-range missiles. It has also made possible the holding of substantive talks on a 50 per cent reduction in United States and Soviet strategic offensive weapons. The initiation of the Vienna Talks on reductions in armed forces and armaments in Europe is an important milestone in modern history. What is important in this regard is that these endeavours are being conducted in a multilateral regional context.Today it is important to make the current positive developments irreversible. It is essential  not only strictly to comply with agreements readied or to conduct negotiations in a spirit of good will with regard for each  others interests  but also not to take steps in a spirit and direction contrary to those developments  not to try to circumvent existing agreements on the elimination of weapons on the pretext of  modernizing  or by building up arms in other categories  and not to erect new  artificial barriers when parties to an agreement have already removed earlier stumbling-blocks.Steps must be taken to solve fundamental problems  namely  fundamental military concepts. The idea of nuclear deterrence is a blood clot in the artery of nuclear disarmament. Wanting to keep nuclear weapons is like being high on drugs. Like drugs that merely give the illusion of happiness while actually ruining one's health  nuclear weapons offer only the Illusion of security while in actual fact they threaten universal annihilation.Trust  predictability  multilateral agreement on the part of all nuclear powers on measures to reduce the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war  reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their verifiable elimination must replace the policy of nuclear intimidation and so-called deterrence. What the world needs is political and legal deterrence rather than nuclear deterrence.Generally speaking  there are serious signs of mutual accommodation on the part of various groups of States in the field of disarmament. This is in large part a direct result of the new political thinking. We welcome the recent Soviet and United States agreements and the latest initiatives of the Soviet Union as set forth in the statement by Eduard Shevardnadze  member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. While a number of differences exist  definite progress towards a broad consensus on disarmament issues can be perceived in the United Nations also. In considering disarmament problems in the United Nations it would clearly be helpful to focus on those areas In which the United Nations  as a unique multilateral forum  possesses appropriate practical capabilities. That could include measures to prevent nuclear war. In particular  it would be advisable to start work on the practical implementation of the proposals  including those of the Secretary-General  to establish a multilateral nuclear and military risk reduction centre and  ultimately  a system of centres that would include regional centres  and the setting up of hot lines between the capitals of all nuclear Powers.The United Nations has the unique potential in yet another important field  that of the n on-proliferation of dangerous types of weapons  whether nuclear or chemical  or missile technology  as well as in the area of banning the development and production oÂ£ new types and systems of weapons of mass destruction.Work must soon begin at the multilateral level on defensive doctrines and the corresponding structures of armed forces  as well as on the principle of reasonable sufficiency for defence. This is really the right time for it. The imperative need for such doctrines  structures and principles is recognized today by virtually all  and  indeed  a number of socialist States have already taken major strides in that direction. Now it is important to negotiate uniform understanding of their essence  criteria and parameters. An appropriate means of starting such a discussion could be negotiated at the General Assembly.Current and forthcoming disarmament processes  including efforts to prevent the extension of the arms race to outer space  as well as harsh economic realities have made a practical issue out of one that until recently might have appeared to be merely theoretical - namely  the issue of the conversion of military industries. In this connection  too  multilateral endeavours would be helpful  such as the preparation and presentation of national conversion plans and other related measures provided for in the Programme of Action of the Conference on Disarmament and Development  with an exchange of experience and theoretical studies designed to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs and inconveniences involved in the transition from an arms economy to a disarmament economy.The Byelorussian SSR has accumulated certain experience in this area. For a long time new our heavy industries  including our defence industries  have been turning out consumer goods with the idea of generating production equal in value to be paid in salaries and wages. Thus military might is gradually ceasing to be the guarantee of security in our diverse  changing and interdependent world. It is being replaced by the concept of a comprehensive approach to the problems of international peace and security in all areas of relations among States. In this connection  the United Nations should become a centre for a system of universal and equal security for all. To that end new approaches are needed to bring about and maintain peace. Most useful principles in this respect are contained in the Charter. They should be used to the full. To that end what is necessary is both a drastic overhaul and long-term fundamental work on improving certain existing machinery that is either idling or has become rusty from infrequent use.The role of the United Nations in resolving regional crises is growing. This is a field in which United Nations machinery has recently achieved major success and made significant progress towards creating new confidence between States in the potential of multilateral diplomacy  which in turn has justified talk of a kind of United Nations renaissance. Although the ultimate goals have not yet been achieved  in this context one can cite Afghanistan  Iran and Iraq and Namibia  efforts on the problems of the Middle East  South-East Asia  Central America  Cyprus and Western Sahara; and the beginning of dialogue  initiated by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  on a settlement in the Korean peninsula.The United Nations peace-making role should be further developed in the years to come. We should move from extinguishing fires to detecting and preventing them. In other words  we must gather and analyse information on regions of conflict  send missions to the field  set up observation posts  prepare recommendations to parties to conflicts  and where necessary conduct operations to prevent military  political  economic  ecological  humanitarian or other conflicts. All this means that we must make the work of the Security Council more productive. There must be meetings at the ministerial level  and the Secretary-General must be more persistent in raising questions. In other words# we are in favour of a transition from crisis diplomacy to preventive diplomacy that will make it clear to everyone that there is no need to jump into the fire to understand that it will be painful.It is time to establish the true primacy of law in international relations. This means unconditional compliance with the Charter and obligations under other legal instruments. Furthermore  multilateral legal institutions  primarily the International Court of Justice  should start working to full capacity  and to that end all States in turn should assume new obligations vis-Ã -vis the decisions of such organs. In this connection  I should like to inform the General Assembly that this year the Byelorussian SSR has accepted the compulsory and binding jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice with regard to six human rights conventions and has ratified additional protocols to the Geneva conventions relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts.New developments and trends in national and world economies have recently been clearly taking shape. Major structural changes are under way. The unipolar pattern has given way to the multipolar system of economic centres. Greater integration of socialist States into the world economy is also changing the picture. The devastating debt burden of the developing countries  the chronic instability of raw-material prices and the poverty of millions all call for our closest attention. The issues of underdevelopment and migration are also growing from a humanitarian-assistance problem into something entirely different: they are becoming a category of universal security. The problems themselves are not new  but it is their magnitude today that gives them a new dimension  which calls for a fundamentally different response. It would appear that it is no longer acceptable to tolerate a situation where the rich grow richer at the expense of the poor  and where discrimination  or even diktat  continues to hold its position in international economic relations. Such a situation has become a threat to global security.Finally  the gap between actual developments in the world economy and the legal regulation of that economy is becoming ever more striking. It has even been sand that the economy is not subordinate to international law  and that  regrettably  can become the case if we all fail jointly to alleviate the situation in this field.The Byelorussian SSR has an interest in this work since  from 1990  we shall be switching over to a new economic environment based on self-management and self-financing  in addition to developing and deepening our trade and economic ties with foreign States and firms. In this connection  I should like to stress that as a result of the years of socialist construction the Byelorussian SSR has become a highly developed and agrarian State that provides its people with modern material and other benefits. That has occurred in spite of the fact that during the Second World War we lost half of our national wealth and a quarter of our population  in spite of the mistakes and aberrations of the past. All this proves the enormous potential inherent in the socialist social system and the fraternal Interaction of the peoples of the USSR.Perestroika and democratization of all aspects of social life new under way in our country will make possible the actual utilization  for the benefit of peoples and individuals   of the enormous potential inherent in socialist production relations.The problem of universal security is aggravated by new environmental threats* pollution of the atmosphere and water  the greenhouse effect  depletion of the ozone layer  deforestation and desertification. Today all this calls for an urgent review of many traditional views of the balance between the interests of individual States and those of the community of nations. What we need is international multilateral research into these problems. It would appear that the solution should be sought in the advent of energy-saving and resource-saving  environmentally clean technologies and production which generate no waste  and in switching over to renewable resources. In this connection  the pooling of our multilateral efforts is indispensable. The forthcoming conference on the environment provides us with an appropriate opportunity to do that.To the Byelorussian SSR  environmental issues have a specific feature of their own because of the need for clean-up operations following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear-power station. Immediately following the disaster we had to resettle almost 25f000 people from the contaminated area to other parts of the Republic and build for them 10 000 apartments with the necessary infrastructure. Today the territory contaminated at various levels with radio-nucleides exceeds 18 per cent of all arable land. Costs and losses resulting from setting up   no-go  zones and from resettlement have already reached about 2 billion roubles. We are planning for further evacuation of local residents from contaminated areas  h comprehensive 16-biIion-rouble programme is now being developed in our Republic for 1990 to 1995 to alleviate the consequences of the accident and provide foe safe living conditions in the affected areas. Our own efforts to that end are being backed by the substantial assistance we are receiving from other fraternal peoples of the Soviet Union. A number of public organizations in our Republic have appealed for help to our fellow countrymen and all people of good will abroad. A translation of the text of that appeal is annexed to the text of my statement that has been distributed to members.We support the United Nations efforts to protect the environment  and also the proposal for the establishment of a centre for urgent environmental assistance and the drawing up of a United Nations programme to mitigate natural disasters and prevent industrial accidents - that is to say  international co-operation in that field  making use among other things of environment-monitoring satellites. In overview  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) should be actively involved in this effort.We must all give the highest priority to the analysis of problems and phenomena that are emerging in the world today - that is  we must recognize the fundamental nature of those changes  identify new global problems  and define new areas for working together and reaching agreement on ways to bring about urgently needed adjustments in out practical actions.Taking into account existing differences of opinion on some global processes  we believe that it is not at all necessary immediately to adopt a single consensus view of the future in order to realize that ultimately it will be wise to prepare for imminent change well in advance. Obviously  the United Nations itself must change in resonance to new challenges and difficulties. It cannot serve merely as a repository of unrealised ideas. It should rather become a generator of new ideas and blaze the trail of change. It is particularly important new for organs of the United Nations system to fulfil their function as a genuine collective intellect and a centre for harmonizing the actions of States.President Gorbachev made a tangible contribution to a better understanding of the new role of the United Nations in his speech to the General Assembly last December  by offering a philosophic rationale for the heightened importance of the internationalisation of efforts by States to ensure their common future in a global home  regardless of their special features  ideologies or socio-political systems.The United Nations has already proved capable of adapting to new conditions. In the current situation it is important not to fragment United Nations political  intellectual and financial resources  but to concentrate them on main problem areas  particularly those where this universal Organization has a particular vantage point  expertise and the ability to formulate global tasks and build consensus on the basis of a balance of interests and realism  so as to perform those tasks in the interests of universal security and co-operation.At the same time  we must all embark on a course of scrupulous compliance with the binding decisions of the Security Council and  in our practical policies  take into account consensus recommendations  while constantly seeking to expand their scope. It would seem the time has come also to give thought to resolving a situation where one or two delegations obstruct general agreement. In this context  some important further steps could be taken  such as practical measures to endow the United Nations with a preventive function  establishing a crisis early warning system  conferring upon the Organization powers to verify compliance with  multilateral agreements and enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations principal organs  including the Secretariat.The new role of the United Nations would be best served if we eliminated duplication of work and strengthened the co-ordination of activities of United Nations specialised agencies in accomplishing global  economic  scientific-technological and social tasks. It would also be useful to develop machinery for United Nations interaction with regional intergovernmental bodies and international non-governmental organizations that deal with problems of universal concern  and also with national public organizations.The United Nations Association that has been created in the Byelorussian SSR intends to be actively involved in the efforts of the world community to translate into reality the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.Attaching paramount importance to the activities within the United Nations framework and to the further development of the World Campaign for Disarmament  we intend to make a regular voluntary contribution to that Fund.The general debate now drawing to a close and the documents adapted at the ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the non-Aligned countries demonstrate that virtually all United Nations Member States recognize the need for new approaches to the problems of mankind. We are convinced that the United Nations has an important role to play in promoting that vision. The delegation of the Byelorussian SSR is prepared to make its own contribution to the discussion of relevant agenda items so that at this very session we may achieve good results which match the imperatives of our time."
"18",860,"BLZ",44,1989,"ï»¿We in Belize are keenly aware of the essential role the United Nations plays in advancing the cause of freedom  peace and justice throughout the world. Our struggle for political independence was rooted in our peoples' desire to be free  but it was nurtured and strengthened right here  in the corridors of the United Nations  by the overwhelming support we received from the international community.It is not surprising  then  that the Constitution of Belize affirms principles of universality - principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God  faith in human rights and fundamental freedoms  and the dignity of the human person. Such principles translate into respect for the sovereignty of other nations  the right to self-determination of peoples  and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his appointment to that high office. The world community looks to him - an accomplished son of Africa - with great expectancy and hope. We express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our deep appreciation and recognition of his tireless efforts in promoting peace and the noble objectives of our Organization.This year  the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly opened in a spirit of optimism. The present atmosphere is one of reduced international tension. The ideological forces that have polarized the world for half a century are diminishing. We see a universal movement of people - people everywhere - in search of freedom and democratic participation.It is a time of momentous change and transformation. There is a growing recognition of the imperative to manage the world's resources in the interests of the global family. While all this is taking place  issues like environmental degradation  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (ANDS) and drug abuse have joined the scourge of poverty as priority issues on the international agenda - doing so in ways that underline how interdependent nations and people have become. The achievements in the political sphere are in stark contrast to persistent economic problems facing many developing com tries. In the Latin American and Caribbean region  the massive debt problem  flight of capital  decline in trade and investment  and the growing disparity between the rich and the poor have resulted in many countries suffering reverses in the decade of the 19803.Reducing poverty and revitalizing growth is the challenge of our time. As we begin the new decade  the task ahead is clear. The development agenda for the 1990s must be to harness growth and use resources creatively to improve the quality of life of all our people. If we are to achieve a high quality of growth and development  our Governments must make better use of the resources. This calls for sound public financial and fiscal responsibility. We must find better ways for public expenditure to complement and spur private production  not displace it and we must provide the essential social infrastructure in education  health and housing to benefit the many  not divert scarce resources to luxuries for a select  privileged few. We must bring the informal workers into the regular economy and allow individual enterprise to flourish.But this will not happen by itself. There is need for concerted action in a new dynamic partnership where people elect Governments and Governments empower people to solve their own problems and take control of their lives. For this to happen  we must launch a new era in education to equip our young people with the knowledge  skills and attitudes they require to take an active role in the development process.Such pragmatic efforts at the national level will  however  be frustrated if the international economic environment is not conducive to development. While we in the developing countries must carry the primary responsibility for our future  the industrialized world has a vital part to play - not just in providing external resources and the transfer of technology  but also in ensuring that the developing countries have easy access to their markets. The time has come to address the pressing imbalances in the world economy. We have repeatedly acknowledged that peace and development are inextricably bound. Indeed  it is true saying that development is another name for peace  or  as others have put it  that economic freedom and political freedom are essential and inseparable considerations on the read to national prosperity. The one will not long survive without the other.Because of this vital connection between politics and economics in ' Id of global interdependence  the special session of the United Nations devoted to international economic co-operation to be convened in April 1990 takes on added importance. Of special concern is the growing trend in the industrialized world toward protectionism. The economic integration of Europe poses new realities for many of our countries in Africa  the Caribbean and the Pacific - the ACP Group. Cur economies are open and vulnerable not only to the ravages of hurricanes but also to the man-made disasters resulting from arbitrary decisions in the boardrooms of the industrialized world which distort the levels of commodity prices.Such vulnerability and fragility make it all the more imperative that we put our own houses in order. We have tried to do that in Belize. Working in accordance with the process of democratic choice  the people of Belize  in the second national elections since our independence eight years ago  decided to replace its Government after one term in office. Belizeans arrived at a consensus to take charge once again of their political  social and economic future in a compassionate and productive atmosphere in which Belizeans come first  l ensure this  they elected to government a majority of the candidates of the People's United Party  the political movement that with the support of the people and the backing of the international community led Belize to independence in 1981. Independence brought with it the promise of development  of more opportunity  peace and stability. Good government delivers and makes possible the attainment by the people of a better standard of living and a higher quality of life. The dynamics of development impel us to give highest priority to that assurance of human dignity - the creation of jobs.My Government  therefore  continues to welcome investors from abroad who  with their capital  technology and access to new markets can join Belizeans in expanding trade and providing increased export earnings and economic activity. Those investors are our partners in development  who will participate with Belizeans in the mixed economy  assuring jobs at decent wages while at the same time benefiting from the climate of free and fair competition of a socially just market economy.In accordance with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes  it is heartening to note the current constructive efforts now under way aimed at achieving the peace that has eluded our region for so long. The present political climate now renders the military option obsolete in resolving the embittered tensions that for ages have remained a major obstacle to international peace and security.The community of nations has reiterated deserved recognition of the far-sighted and unfailing determination of the Contadora process in its conviction that the peoples of Central America wish to achieve peace  reconciliation  development  id justice without interference  in accordance with their own decisions and historical experience.The recent signing of the historic Tela agreement between five Central American Presidents is the latest example of the region's commitment to fulfilling the undertakings assumed under the Eequipulas procedure in search of a firm and lasting peace. That joint plan for the voluntary demobilization  repatriation or relocation of the Nicaraguan resistance is hailed as a singular achievement of the Central American peace process  which seeks national reconciliation and democratization.Belize maintains its commitment to peaceful coexistence and harmony with all our neighbours. Over the past year Belize and Guatemala have continued the negotiating process aimed at the conclusion of a possible draft of a comprehensive treaty to afford a just and lasting determination of the controversy. We stand ready to resume these discussions with a renewed spirit of goodwill   without compromising the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Belize.The continued support of our sister Caribbean countries  the Commonwealth of Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement  as well as the solidarity and understanding of out Latin American neighbours  gives us confidence that the reality of our two sovereign nations living as good neighbours will find universal acceptance.In a similar vein we applaud the announcement of the renewal of negotiations between the United Kingdom and Argentina over the Falkland Islands  recalling our own struggle  we exhort our Argentine friends to refrain from any action that might be prejudicial to the Interests of the Falklands or compromise their inalienable right to self-determination.My Government continues to be seriously concerned at the erosion of the constitutional process and the denial to the people of Panama of their right freely to elect a Government of their choice. The decision of the military leadership to annul elections and subsequently impose a president of its own choosing as Head of State of Panama further isolates that country in the international community.The friendship and co-operation between the peoples of Belize and Panama have a long history and it Is the wish of ray Government that this relationship should continue. We recall the solidarity demonstrated by Panama during Belize's struggle for independence and the pivotal role played by the late Panamian leader General Torrijos towards the achievement of Belizean independence.We call on the current leadership in Panama to co-operate in national and regional efforts to establish the framework for a return to democracy and constitutional rule in Panama and to put in place mechanisms for early and fair elections.The success of democracy is inevitable  as is now being proved in several parts of the world. We invite the leadership in Haiti to take certain steps on the path to democracy to demonstrate its commitment to early elections and transition to democratic rule and we ask all sectors of Haitian society to co-operate in this important process.We now focus attention once more on the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs. The magnitude of this global problem  in addition to its economic and social consequences  has now become a major national security concern for many nations in our region. At home in Belize we are committed to launching a concerted drive to eradicate the drug problem and to join forces in regional and international actions to put an end to this menace to society.While the cultivation and use of marijuana in Belize have abated considerably  we recognize a new danger stemming from the growing use of crack and cocaine  as well as the use of our territory as a trans-shipment point for illegal drugs. In the face of these problems my Government proposes to work in collaboration with friendly Governments at the interdiction level to eliminate this serious threat to our country. We also recognize that if the use of illegal drugs in our society is to be eliminated  the problem must be addressed as an education issue as well. We will therefore shortly be launching a major campaign using all available resources in our educational system to focus national attention on the inherent dangers associated with the use of illicit drugs. We also plan to establish a drug rehabilitation centre and welcome international support in this endeavour.We wish to record our support for the related proposal of our sister Caribbean Community (CARICCK) State of Jamaica  which calls for the establishment of a multinational anti-drug task force within the United Nations system. This is a welcome opportunity for countries to pool their resources and intelligence capabilities against the well-organized  well-financed  and better-equipped drug cartels. And we can do so without infringing on the sovereignty of any nation.Despite some progress and relaxation of political tensions in conflicts on the continent  the minority white racist Pretoria regime continues its intransigence  oppressing and exploiting the already dispossessed black majority in South Africa. The apartheid policy of this terrorist settler rule administration remains today as the glaring obstacle in the path of peace  stability and development in that region. Belize does not entertain notions that apartheid  as a crime against humanity  can be reformed. We insist on the total eradication of all vestiges of this system  which is an affront to any standard of human dignity. Belize continues to associate itself with those who are committed to keeping up the relentless pressure on South Africa until our brothers and sisters eventually triumph using all possible means in their just and legitimate struggle.On Namibia  we trust that the Security Council will lend its full weight to ensuring that South Africa proceeds to disband all its paramilitary and commando units which still threaten the implementation of political progress towards Independence. Even at this late stage  the international community must remain vigilant to ensure that South Africa does not succeed in subverting the process towards democratic elections in Namibia.Belize recognizes the urgency of achieving a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict  the core of which is the question of Palestine. No just and lasting peace can be achieved in the Middle East until the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized  including their right to self-determination and a homeland  without compromising Israel's security. At a time when the Palestinian leadership under Chairman Yasser Arafat is offering important peace initiatives  my delegation looks forward to the early convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization and all parties on an equal footing.In the case of Lebanon  it is our hope that the current cease-fire will be respected by all the parties concerned and that Lebanon will be given the opportunity to recover from the destruction and violence which has occurred. All Lebanon wants is to be left alone so that it can find Lebanese solutions to Lebanese problems. Outside interference can only hinder this.The global issue which today holds centre stage is the environment. In the coming decade  the world must deal much more effectively with problems resulting from the degradation of the environment acid rain  ocean pollution  nuclear and toxic waste  ozone depletion and climate change. Industrial countries account for over 75 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions  the main cause of global warming. Clearly  therefore  the major responsibility to reduce emissions rests there.Belize has its own concerns our rain forests  our coral reef system and our flora and fauna are gifts of God which we have a duty to protect for generations of Belizeans yet unborn. We are committed to protecting Belize's natural resources and environment to maintain a harmonious ecological balance  but we must take a holistic approach to the environmental challenge. We must promote and protect the environmental qualities of life in the fullest sense by extending economic choice and opportunities  for poverty is the ultimate environmental degradation. A fundamental environmental task for the decade ahead is the promotion of sustainable agriculture to feed our people. We must meet the growing environmental challenge by expanding economic freedom. True and lasting economic development must necessarily include maintaining ecological balance.Our societies in the third world are undergoing serious strains in the care of children and in guaranteeing women equal opportunities in education and employment. Our ability as a people to provide the values and ideals that will guide the next generation will determine the course of social realities in the twenty-first century. As a policy  the Government of Belize supports public and private initiatives in the promotion and defence of human rights  and particularly the rights of the child and of women. As soon as it is practicable  Belize will accede to and ratify the convention on the rights of the child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women  end give practical effect to them by force of law.All this requires action new. The future is now. We can promote political freedom if we also promote economic freedom. We can aim for a high quality of growth while at the same time providing for the equitable distribution of the fruits of growth. We can achieve greater productivity and expanded trade if we liberate the creative energies of out people and remove the barriers to an interdependent global economy. If we do act effectively together  we may be able to look back on this time as a turning point in building a more peaceful and just world - a new world  a far better world - one in which the eternal dignity of man is respected. "
"19",907,"BOL",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like first to extend my congratulations to you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. I wish you every success in your endeavours. I also wish to thank the United Nations  through the Secretary-General  for the extraordinary role which it is playing in the international system and for the extraordinary role that the Secretary-General is playing personally.I have given a great deal of thought to the way in which I might begin this dialogue with the international community and to the concerns that I should communicate to the representatives present here. I have decided that the most appropriate course would be to share with you a profound concern which I  as a political leader and as a citizen  have felt. It is a concern which I believe is not mine alone  rather one which is universal and of interest to the world as a whole  I am referring to that complex problem of alienation between society and the State  which is producing among the people almost everywhere in the world  a constant feeling of mistrust and lack of belief which  in my opinion  is eroding the very bases of any proper political system  in particular a democratic one.In the few days that I have been in New York  when I have been travelling around in the official car of the Bolivian Mission  I have noticed that few people on the streets seem to be paying any attention to the cars. Most people seem to see them as an expression of some kind of power. The United Nations itself may be seen to be expressing a power that is concentrated every year during the General Assembly. But after all it is a power which  in one way or another  is suffering from this problem of the distancing of the people and this generates a feeling of despair or mistrust or disbelief. There seems to be a world citizenry who do not feel that the authorities are part of their daily lives.That is my first concern  but there is another thought  which 1 consider necessary. I believe that the citizens of our world want to be able to believe in something important transcending boundaries. For this reason they are asking us to be truthful - truthful at all times with respect to any problem. That truth may be the antidote to distrust. It may give our citizens faith and hope in their own societies  Governments and States. That is why I believe  today  that the words of the Gospel are of greater importance than ever before - the words that tell us that the truth - and only the truth - will make us free. There can be no freedom without truth. It is impossible to imagine truth that does not express itself within a free system. That is why I should like  openly and frankly  to tell you our truth - the truth of the President of the Republic of Bolivia  the truth of all Bolivians. But first of all  a profound truth that involves the very roots of our nationality.I come from a country which is embedded in the heart of the South American continent  where all the geographical features of South America converge. It is difficult for us as Bolivians to know whether South America begins in Bolivia or whether South America ends in that geographical knot which is called Bolivia  whether our country marks the starting-point or the limit of the continent. I wonder how many people died in that act of violence. I wonder whether in the civil war which is afflicting a number of Latin American countries more children are dying than died in the violence entailed in the process of economic and financial stabilization  such as the one in my country.There is another problem facing contemporary democracy  especially in the poorest countries: is economic and financial stability compatible with democracy? That is a challenge to the entire United Nations  because our democracies  given hyper-inflation  the economic crisis and instability  are becoming defenceless - economically and financially defenceless. This is another issue in which the international community must shoulder responsibility.But  in addition to engaging in the process of bringing about economic and financial stability  our country - in that Latin America which is in such a state of upheaval and which is attempting to work towards democracy through transition - has strengthened its democracy. I can say with pride before all the peoples of the world: Bolivia today has a strong democracy. We have carried out this process in our own way  with our own laws. We have succeeded because of a meeting of minds of Bolivians  the patriotic agreement of the overwhelming majority of Bolivians  which led to a Government of national unity in which political organizations and individuals that had fought each other for almost 20 years managed to come together.That can be understood only in light of the fact that one stage of Bolivian national political life was superseded - that is  the situation following the 1930s  the world crisis the Chaco war. And today there has been a change in Bolivian national policy: a new cycle  an attempt to make consensus  agreement and harmony  rather than conflict and confrontation  the foundations of Bolivia's democratic policy. That is what we are starting to call the revolution of democracy - a revolution occurring all over the world  now that it is no longer possible to have single parties or hegemonic parties or elements in national political life  and everyone is obliged to share and work together.While we arrived at this solution in Bolivia  our Polish brothers and sisters were finding a different solution. And earlier we had had the French model of ideologically and historically opposing forces managing to share power within a democratic system.But  together with this economic and financial stabilization  achieved with so many sacrifices  in a continent - and I emphasize this - where in recent decades democracy has been an exception  today in Bolivia political stability has been strengthened. I must recognize that this has been the result of the efforts of the entire national community and its institutions? and that the Bolivian armed forces - which the international community had regarded as a source of constant instability in our country - have today  like all other elements in Bolivia  become an institution which is a real  solid basis for contemporary Bolivian democracy. In addition  our humble country has succeeded  with a special effort  in solving a problem that has been discussed here on many occasions and is being discussed at this very session - the problem of foreign debt. In the past two years our country  in the midst of an economic crisis and the process of democratic transition  has managed to honour and pay almost 30 per cent of its foreign debt - money owed to the international banking system - $300 million - and bilateral indebtedness. That was possible because of the will of Bolivians and their Government  but also because of international co-operation  which enabled us to renegotiate with the international banks on terms advantageous to the country. It was also possible because of the coincidence that in recent weeks there came to power two Governments  in Bolivia and in Argentina  with faith in Latin America  Governments that believe in Latin Americanism and that with respect to their bilateral debts apply the principle whose application they had been demanding for many years of the rich industrialized countries - the basic principle that there are certain debts that it is technically impossible to pay  and that to find a solution what is needed is the political will and political decisions.President Menem of Argentina and the President of Bolivia took the decision mutually to write off the debts that had accumulated over past years between the two countries. I believe that that precedent set by contemporary Bolivia and contemporary Argentina can be linked positively with other efforts being made in the same direction to resolve the problem  which is of such magnitude.That is why I stand before the Assembly  proud of my people and of my country  Whose age-old culture and contemporary achievements from an unbroken line guaranteed by the people themselves  who are determined to realize their own destiny in their own sovereign way. Therefore  I should like to paraphrase  humbly  but also proudly  words 1 used in my election campaign  saying to the international community: ""Here we are before you with what we have done"". What more can you ask of us? What more can you say? We also stand here with our will to work with the international community to resolve the basic problems of our world of today.At the same time I want to tell the Assembly that we represent the voice of a whole new generation that has emerged in our country. This is not only a Bolivian phenomenon; it is a Latin American  continental phenomenon. In the past two decades of Latin American life a new political generation has been formed  a generation trained in the school of the struggle for democracy. We are the generation that brought about the clash against the dictatorships to create the democracies on our continent. Although it may seem a young generation  it is an experienced generation  bearing the scars of the struggle against the dictatorships. It remembers the lives of the martyrs who paid the price to bring democracy to Latin America. It is a generation that knows that the struggle was for the Latin American people  the Bolivian people  and that therefore understands that we cannot accept any democracy that is not at the unconditional service of all the inhabitants of Latin America  including the neediest.None the less  I want to tell representatives that this Bolivia  which has made those achievements in recent years  is a country which  like all other third world countries  like all the other developing countries  has not resolved basic structural problems. My country continues to have a problem of chronic unemployment  even more chronic because of the financial and economic adjustments we have had to make. My country still has a small market and a small productive sector  and it remains a country on the sidelines of the global economy. Indeed  I would say that it is at the margin of the sidelines. It remains a country of critical poverty  perhaps among the most acute on our continent.Together with those continuing structural problems  which are challenges to be met by Bolivians  with international co-operation  we still have  in spite of our current achievements  the grave structural problem of lack oÂ£ access to the sea. We continue to be a mountainous enclave in the heart of South America. I do not want to dwell on a problem that has existed for more than a hundred years  but I do want to point out here  to the international community  that our demand for a sovereign outlet to the sea is a Bolivian demand that cannot be renounced.Over Bolivia's long history we have lost territory in the Amazon region  but that does not mean that we ceased to be a country of the Amazon. We have lost territory in the Rio de la Plata area  but that does not mean that we ceased to be a Rio de la Plata country. But in losing territory giving access to the Pacific we ceased to be a maritime country. In other words  we lost not only territory  but the benefit of being a country with access to the sea  which we had when we began our independent existence. That is the basis in justice of our claim for access to the sea.While members of a past generation led us into an unjust war that resulted in the problem  we of the new generation stress that at the end of the twentieth century we cannot continue to deal with Bolivia's maritime problem and Bolivia's claim with the tired and limited mentality of the nineteenth century. We must begin to approach it with the new outlook that must be adopted as we enter the twenty-first century. In that context  we must find a solution in the new spirit  full of hope  of the coming century.1 make this claim here at the United Nations because it is precisely in this international forum that it has been recognized that for the underdeveloped countries lade of access to the sea is one of the causes of underdevelopment and poverty. That has been recognized in the world Organization.But above and beyond all of this  I wish to turn to my compatriots from Bolivia  my Latin American compatriots from Chile and from Peru  and tell them that we should take up this challenge on behalf of our peoples and our Governments and find a solution which will open new prospects for all of us  new possibilities and a new prosperity to construct together.I wish to speak about some other problems facing my country - and not just my country  for we share them with the entire international community. These are problems such as illicit drug trafficking  the systematic erosion and impoverishment of the global environment  and acute poverty.Concerning the drug traffic  we are all aware that this is an old problem  but we should welcome the fact that recently the international community has gained a new awareness of the importance of the problem  and that as a fundamental part of that new awareness it has been fully understood that this not a problem of one country alone or of a handful of countries but  rather  an international problem  a problem for the international community as a whole. We should also welcome the fact that  having understood this  the international community has now incorporated the concept of co-responsibility in its approach to the drug traffic. This in itself is a great achievement: it is a great achievement that the average American citizen  who may indeed be suffering the consequences of drug addiction in his own family  understands that somewhere else in the world  in Bolivia  there are peasants facing an equally acute problem from a humanitarian aid moral standpoint  from the standpoint of their lives and the quality of their lives. It is important also that that Bolivian citizen in the countryside should understand that  just as he has existential problems in connection with the drug traffic  in the United States and in other parts of the world there are people for whom it is also a problem  a problem of life and death. I believe that this is an international achievement we should all welcome. The Vienna Convention is a reflection of this' progress  and recently in the United States  through President Bush's plan  we have seen another reflection of concern over this problem and a new approach commensurate with the international community's rising awareness of the problem. Of course  we welcome this plan  although we share the view here that the resources allocated to implementing the plan ace perhaps not commensurate with the new awareness the plan reflects.But I know that the international community wants to know Bolivia's opinion on this - and I said at the beginning of my statement that Bolivians would tell the truth  would tell our truth in this forum. So it is important to state that  so far as this problem is concerned  we are convinced that we must tell each other the truth  frankly and once and for all. It would be very bad for us to deal in empty phrases. But it would be still worse if each of our countries were tempted to handle the problem on the basis of politics  of domestic political needs or other types of interests.We must be sincere  we must tell each other the truth - and the first truth I wish to tell the international community is this; I wonder whether we are really waging a head-on war against drug trafficking. I wonder whether we are actually in a state of war  because sometimes that does not seem to be the case. The worst thing I could do would be to involve my country in a war that is not the war we should be waging  or that we are waging as a formality or because of some other need. So let us be honest with each other in the international community about this problem; let us try to tackle the problem properly  for if we really are waging a war it is because we want to win that war - indeed  that is the objective of going to war. Having examined President Bush's plan  I think we must base our analysis on differences between  on the one hand  consumer countries  areas and sectors and  on the other  countries  areas or sectors which sell their services or act as intermediaries or channels for drugs  and we have to draw a distinction between both of these and the countries that produce the raw materials: if we do not draw that clear distinction  we shall not be seeing the war in its true and proper dimensions and will run the risk of making things even more complicated than they are today.The thinking of the Bolivian people is that the problem of drug trafficking is similar to the foreign-debt problem in many aspects. It is a scourge  just as the foreign debt is a scourge. However  in drug trafficking  as in the matter of the foreign debt  there are common issues which are of interest to the whole international community and are part of a common strategy that we need to carry out together. But to use the analogy of the foreign debt again  each country has its own specific problems and drug trafficking takes specific forms in different countries. That is why we say that we need to consider the general case  but at the same time we need to look at particular cases  at what is specific about the way the problem presents itself in each country. Hence we must say that for the consumer countries the basic requirement is a policy of prevention. It is not the only step that needs to be taken  but prevention is fundamental. However  for the countries that act as middlemen and as marketing countries  and countries through which drugs are channelled  then the basic requirement is prohibition and suppression. But in the poor  underdeveloped countries  where the raw material is produced - such as the coca leaf in Bolivia - the basic requirement has to be development alternatives to the coca crop.Consequently  with respect to consumer countries  it is preventions for intermediary countries  it is prohibition* and in underdeveloped countries the production of the raw material needs to be eradicated through development alternatives  such as other products. But markets for such products must be found. What kind of President would I be if I were to tell Bolivian farmers that they needed to change their crops  which provide them with specific benefits  for other crops that would provide them fewer benefits and leave them uncertain of finding new international markets  for there would be unwillingness to open up international markets to those alternative products?I believe that we must be perfectly clear on this point if we are seriously to tackle the problem - and that is what I would call a real war  one which we must all fight together.I have spoken with a number of Heads of State and other leaders here - including President Bush  with whom I had a very pleasant talk which generated a great deal of mutual esteem. In those talks I indicated that  in so far as my country is concerned  the best way to fight against drug trafficking was to invest in Bolivia  because drug trafficking cannot be separated from unemployment and from the economic crisis. Drug trafficking is also linked to the critical moment in my country. Therefore  we would be mistaken to believe that all we needed to do in Bolivia was to curtail production  just as we would be mistaken to believe that the drug problem in the United States could be solved through the substitution of crops or the starting of alternative development. We need to place things in the right context. In my talks with the President of the United States and others in this country  as well as representatives of other countries  I was fortunate to encounter a clear understanding that we must tackle the problem together and in this context.I also wish to state here before the international community that Bolivia is ready to mobilize all its national will and commit itself to a frontal attack against drug trafficking. We are prepared to do so on the basis of our own national reality; we are prepared to do so together with the entire international community. We ask that  based on our own concept  every people take its own initiative within its own country  because this is an endeavour that cannot be accomplished on one's own. Every people needs to tackle the problem directly.Bolivia pledges to do its part on its own territory  to take the lead in the struggle on its own territory. We ask co-operation from the international community so as to press forward with the struggle  and we hope that the international community will assess the endeavours of the Bolivians in the light of the results of our struggle in our own land.Bolivians are ready to shoulder their own responsibility in the struggle on their own national territory. We seek international co-operation because our country is poor in resources  poor in logistics  poor in infrastructure - co-operation in the struggle against drugs and for development. We accept to be judged by the international community on the results that we shall achieve as a people in this struggle. We also intend to enhance national awareness in respect of this struggle and  as a country  we pledge to work together with the international community to fight against another scourge - the deterioration of the environment.Fortunately  Bolivia remains one of the few ecological preserves of the planet. When President Menem flew over Bolivia three days ago at one o'clock in the morning and as a Latin American sent me a fraternal message  I answered him by saying that I welcomed him in my country's airspace and that I was very pleased that he was flying through one of America's purest skies. My words were not meant as a metaphor? they reflected an ecological reality  for his plane was flying through one of the least polluted skies of the continent.We are prepared to enter this struggle as well and to do so as a country of the Amazon region. A great deal is being said these days about the Amazon. There is something that members perhaps do not know - in proportion to its territory  Bolivia is the most Amazon country of South America. Over 70 per cent of Bolivian territory is in the Amazon basin. We have spoken with President Sarney to promote an ecologically sound production policy in the Amazon territory that we share. We would like to work together with the other countries concerned. We should not be prevented from opening up new productive economic frontiers for the peoples of these territories in the name of a false ecological concept. We need to seek balance between the need of our people for development and the need of our people  and of all mankind  not to harm nature. In this regard  we are prepared in our development process not to repeat the actions taken by the developed countries that have harmed the environment in their development process. That is also a challenge for mankind. The problems of drug trafficking and the environment are related to another problem  namely  that of extreme poverty. I call these the three scourges: drug trafficking  extreme poverty  and the economic  financial and external debt crisis - the latter being the overriding scourge of the poor countries  like my own. These are the scourges facing poor countries such as ours.For our people  they are the three horsemen of the Apocalypse  so in our struggle we cannot separate them. If we are to combat drug trafficking we must combat poverty as well  and we must preserve the environment. The production of cocaine is related to the systematic destruction of the environment in countries where it is produced. In order to combat damage to the environment we need to combat both drug trafficking and extreme poverty. And to fight against extreme poverty we need to fight against drug trafficking and damage to the environment. This is  as I said before  an inseparable trilogy  and anyone who does not understand this is not fighting the right war  and as I am sure the international community will understand  we should not be fighting the wrong war.We are prepared to run our own risks-  we are prepared to shoulder our responsibilities-  and we are prepared to share all of this with the international community. But  above and beyond everything that I have said  I want to tell this Assembly that Bolivia  with its Government of national unity  with its process of national harmony  has definite goals in mind. We want to maintain the economic and financial stability that we have won at such great cost. By the end of the year Bolivia will have a maximum rate of inflation of 12 per cent. Truly this is a record in Latin America. This economic and financial stability is an achievement for our people  and we certainly cannot throw it out of the window. We want to use it as the basis for development because stability without growth is fragile: it has feet of clay. Stability without movement is the stability of the cemetery. There is stability in cemeteries  but it is the stability of death  what we want is the stability of life  which is the stability of growth. We want stability with a profound policy of social development. I would like to refer very briefly to certain international problems in respect of which Bolivia's voice must be heard. As Latin Americans  we believe that a Latin American solution must be found to the problems of Central America  and we believe that that solution must be based on a resolution of the problem of democracy. In the last analysis  what is at stake in Central America is the question of democracy. Let us allow each country to be the protagonist of its own democracy  so long as it is a clear democracy that can coexist with others. I believe that the countries of Central America have a special responsibility because they are most familiar with the problems of the sub-region.As Latin Americans  we Bolivians must reaffirm that the Malvinas Islands are Latin American  that they belong to Argentina  but that Argentina and the United Kingdom should find a solution in the form of an international agreement. He fervently hope that there will be fruitful dialogue between those two countries  both of which have age-old fraternal links with Bolivia.In the international sphere  there is something else that is very important to Bolivia. We want an appropriate solution to be found to the problem of the Middle East. We want a just solution that respects the rights of all the peoples of the Middle East. There can be no solution that works to the detriment of any party  because such a solution would not respect tine rights of all those who coexist in the region.That is why I welcome the efforts made by the United Nations in that area. I hope an international conference under United Nations auspices will take place and that none of the parties or their authentic representatives will be excluded from it  lest we approach the problem without any real determination to solve it.Much has changed in today's world; those changes are but the forerunners of future changes. Our world is moving closer to detente  understanding and co-operation. We hope the next century  which will be upon us in a few years  will find us all sharing a single ideology: the ideology of global civilization  of a universal culture in which we are all linked to one another. It is up to us.We are already seeing some signs of that world of the future  a future from which we may look back at the twentieth century and its problems in the same way we look today  in history books  at the problems of the eighteenth century  in the same way we look at tine problems discussed by the encyclopaedists of that age.Technology is becoming the ideology of the modern world  for technology is drawing us all together. It operates above and beyond the ideologies we inherited from past centuries. Technology and culture will be the ideology of the twenty-first century. What is the ideological difference between an American astronaut and a Soviet cosmonaut? They share the same ideology  technology. They are scientists and have few differences between them. That may be a model of the world to come  a model to be shared by all mankind.I wish in conclusion to reiterate my faith in the United Nations system and in the purposes of the Organization: to combat poverty and backwardness now and in the future. I believe the United Nations can no longer tolerate the violence of oppression  extreme poverty or the presence of violence and death in many parts of tine world. Deep in our hearts  we all feel that those problems must be resolved.Since 1945 leaders of the entire world have come here to tell the truth: their truth. Some have come with the arrogance of strength) some have come with the anger of powerlessness. But we have all come here to tell our truth.As the President of a poor and humble country  I would recall the wise message of Ecclesiastes where it is written that""wisdom is better than strength; nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised  and his words are not heard"". (The Holy Bible  Ecclesiastes 9-.16) The United Nations and the international community must hear the words of the poor  because  as the Holy Father has said  the new name of development is peace."
"20",954,"BRA",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  allow me to congratulate Your Excellency on your election. Your experience assures us that you will lead our work along a firm and constructive path. I extend my congratulations to your illustrious predecessor.May I once again express the appreciation of Brazil for the Secretary-General Mr. Perez de Cuellar. At the outset of this statement I wish to pay a tribute to and express my respect for the people of Colombia and for President Virgilio Barco for giving the world an example of civic courage and patient heroism  governing as he is a region fraught with turmoil  where lawlessness and fanaticism combine to destroy the country in the hallucinating anti-life of drugs.In 1985  soon after taking office  I stood at this podium. Brazil was then emerging from a long night. It was recovering from tragedy and facing great uncertainties. On the international scene discord prevailed. Four years later I see a different political landscape: conflicts have been reduced and dialogue resumed. There is hope. The war between Iran and Iraq has come to an end. Foreign troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan. Positive developments have taken Place in Central America and southern Africa. Namibia is well on the way to independence. There are genuine prospects for internal reconciliation and understanding in Angola. Direct contact has been resumed between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The interests of peace  security and development have been reinforced in the South Atlantic. The two super-Powers have come to agreement on the actual reduction of nuclear arsenals.But we are still far from a world free from anguish  tension and fear. There still remain problems clamouring for solution. In the Middle East the fury of fanaticism continues to claim the lives of innocent peoples and to tear asunder States such as Lebanon  which was once exemplary for its balance between different religious groups  m South Africa the apartheid regime still persists  an affront to the conscience of civilized peoples  in certain areas  to a greater or lesser degree  human rights are being disregarded. In East Timor appeals go unheeded.But the spirit of peace has made progress as the supreme value of coexistence among nations. Other great values of modern man - democracy and human rights - have gained strength. As we look back over these last four years there is one thing of which we can be certain: degradation is moving ahead in thecontemporary world. The establishment or re-establishment of free institutions is a universal aspiration.The march is on to reinstate or establish democratic freedoms. From my own Painful  experience I bear witness to the struggle in the transition to It has the significance of life and a bitter fight  mitigated by the fascination of Playing   part in great changes. My term of office will soon come to an end. What can offer as an end result is to have achieved in five years 50 years of progress towards democracy. We are enjoying a period of unprecedented freedom. Our institutions have been restored and a State based on the rule of law has been established. We have built a truly democratic society  with a high degree of organization and participation  in an open system which enables the people to express their will. We are the third largest democracy in the world  with 82 million voters. We held elections in 1985 and 1986. In 1987 we convened a National Constituent Assembly. We drafted a new Constitution. We held elections in 1988  and on 15 November this year we will elect my successor. All this is taking place in a peaceful and orderly climate  always harmonizing the exuberance of aspirations that have at last been freed. We have had to contend with 10 000 strikes  they were settled in a spirit of conciliation. We have been operating within an economic crisis. It is not only through Brazil that the winds of freedom have swept. In South America  that vast new world  there will not be a single country which is not under democratic rule by the end of the year. authoritarianism has been definitely discredited.  The greatest wave of democratisation the world has known since the end of the war has swept through Latin America. A burning question  however haunts the conscience of our people: will the democratic values that we built be capable of dealing with the problems of suffering  misery  poverty  inequality  exploitation and violence that are part of our daily lives? Are the democracies of the wealthy countries joining us in solidarity with our cause  or are they concerned only with their own well-being  relegating us to marginal existence? I am convinced that democracy is the road to follow. It was the banner that led our people to sweep away authoritarian regimes  strongmen  tyrants and dictators. But it did not do so merely to replace them with hunger  disease  backwardness  foreign debt  recession and unemployment. Latin America shows signs of negative growth. It is not that we have grown less than other countries: it is simply that we have moved backwards. Suffice it to say that in 1988 the region's gross domestic product was at the same level as in 1978. The net transfer of resources abroad in 1988 amounted to $29 billion. Brazil alone  in the past five years  transferred approximately $56 billion abroad. This is Marshall plan in reverse. The greatest wave of degradation the world has seen since the end of the second world war has swept through Latin America. A burning question. however  haunts the conscience of our peoples  are the democratic values that we have built be capable of dealing with the problems of suffering  misery  poverty  inequality  and violence that are part of our everyday life. Are the democracies the wealthy countries coming in solidarity with us or are they concerned only about their well-being relegating us to a marginal existence?I am convinced that democracy is the road to follow. It is the banner through which our peoples to sweep away authoritarian regimes  strongmen  tyrants and dictators  ant it did not do so merely to replace them with hunger  disease.backwardness  foreign debt  recession and unemployment. Latin America shows signs of negative growth  it means that it has grown less than other continents and that we simply we have moved backwards.The 1980s have seen a sustained expansion of the industrialized economies. It was to be expected that this expansion would stimulate economic growth in the developing countries. Nevertheless  the rise in international interest rates for reasons beyond our control  the drastic reduction in the prices of raw materials  commercial protectionism  the volatility of exchange rates  the globalisation of financial markets  and the net capital outflows have been responsible for the frustration of that expectation.The United Nations planned in its development strategy for the 1980s that the gap between the rich and the poor would be reduced. But what happened? The number of least developed countries increased from 30 to 42.Once again I ask: if the democracy we have established throughout our continent fails to meet the legitimate aspirations of our societies  how can we prevent its values from being challenged? It will serve no purpose to invoke the imperfect realization of such values.The greatest enemies of democracy on our continent have been low standards of living and inflation  which corrode our economies. Lacking in resources and oppressed by a perverse international economic situation  the leaders of Latin America have no means available to meet the most legitimate and fundamentalaspirations of their societies. Guerrilla movements are proliferating in several countries. Spontaneous manifestations of revolt are springing up. Violence is building up and pent-up forces of rebellion may at any time emerge and spread uncontrollably.We are no longer dealing with ideological motivations. What is at stake in Latin America is no longer the dichotomy between the capitalist and the socialist systems. In Latin America  the persistence of poverty and the worn-out models of development make ideologies outdated. This climate does not seem to be inspired by any doctrines or fed by revolutionary designs. It is a rebellion growing out of  the lack of prospects and the frustration of the deprived and disenchanted masses. Its origins are lost in remote historical times. The choice today is not between militarism and populism  but between recession and growth.A great many things are being said about the interdependence of today's world. For Latin America  however  interdependence has shown only its negative side  interdependence is invoked when we are confronted with the perpetuation of an international order that in reality relegates us to a dependency in which the Poorest are paradoxically coined to finance the richest and in which transfers of knowledge take place only on a horizontal plane. That is certainly not the kind of interdependence to which we aspire.The European Common Market needed the shock of war in order to materialize. In our case  we are determined to take advantage of the shock of democracy in order to advance towards Bolivar's dream of long ago: the building of Latin American political brotherhood  Latin America  the victim of violent colonial greed  has become the most genuine melting-pot of races and cultures  extending on an unprecedented scale the miscegenation of ethnic groups and the blending of religions and customs. For Brazil  the fate of our neighbours is our own fate.For us in Latin America and the Caribbean  the option for social progress is an ethical and economic imperative. We cannot continue to waste enormous Quantities of human talent because they are denied access to nourishment and education. According to the United Nations Children's Fund  there are in the world today 145 million abandoned minors between the ages of 12 and 16  and perhaps 100 million of that number live in the streets  tempted into larceny  prostitution  drugs and mugging.Need we point out that these starving and unprotected adolescents in the third world are the present-day version of the poverty-stricken youth we encounter in the most biting pages of Dickens  Victor Hugo or Dostoevski?There is an urgent need to create conditions through which the developing countries can return to their natural status as recipients of capital  reversing as quickly as possible the trend that has made them exporters of financial resources under the cruel burden of foreign debt.The discipline and co-operation established by the international monetary and commercial institutions set up in the post-war period have given way to the dominance of the powerful countries' national autonomy in the formulation of their macroeconomic policies. Severe imbalances and asymmetries have developed. The impoverished situation of the developing economies have grown worse. Brazil  for example  is paying more to those institutions than it receives from them.Another major problem is the trend towards an oligopoly of knowledge. Human knowledge is a cumulative process  anywhere  any time. Knowledge is universal. To restrain its potential for changing the well-being of the world  thereby restricting it to the domain of trade  of economic advantage  of cultural colonization  is to reduce mankind to material objectives that deny man himself. Science and technology  today or tomorrow  must be placed at the service of everyone  not only of a few nations.Yet another disturbing development is the exploitation of the vulnerability imposed upon us by our foreign debt. The developing countries are being pressured to conform to a model of adjustment which is not often followed by the industrialized countries. Budgets are being balanced at enormous social cost and at the price of State bankruptcy  wages are being depressed below subsistence levels  scant attention is being paid to the legitimate aspirations of infant industries and to balance-of-payments requirements  the public sector has kindled even in those areas in which the need for action is greatest  such as education and health. No attention is being paid to the fact that the primary need of the debtor countries is to grow and that only through accelerated growth can they introduce the necessary economic reforms. fulfil their commitments and contribute  as they have in the past  to global progress.There is an urgent need to understand that growth is impossible when about one third of domestic savings is exported to foreign countries every year. It will be impossible to make any adjust as long as we are required to solve an insoluble equation. It is time to recognize that up to now the remedy for the problem of foreign debt has contributed chiefly to the financial health of the creditors. For the debtors it has been a prescription for stagnation and impoverishment. I repeat: the time has come to adopt a strategy based on the assumption of renewed growth in the debtor countries. Such a strategy will require a sharp reduction in the stock of the debt and in the gross and net transfers of resources abroad  the only way to retain the savings necessary to finance development.We view with deep concern the slow pace and the indifference with which this problem is being handled and the way its solution is being postponed.There are two major questions to which we must also give our priority attentions environmental protection and the fight against drug traffic and drug abuse. These subjects wi11 figure more and more prominently on our global agenda.The first question relates to the survival of mankind  to the death of life on this planet. The second relates to a life of death  to anti-life  to the destruction of the human person  chiefly in its purest form: youth.In the question of the environment we have another dimension of the interdependence of nations. As inhabitants of the same small planet  we are all condemned to solidarity.The environmental question in its planetary aspects - climate change  depletion of the ozone layer - cannot and must not be discussed from a narrow Perspective  as if it were a problem between North and South in which the less developed countries  by their irresponsible behaviour  were affecting the ecological balance of the world.The truth is quite different. The industrialized countries bear the greatest responsibility for the pollution of the environment. The developing countries cannot accept as a basis for a new mode of international relations a concept of environmentally sustainable development which assigns to them only the task of ensuring the ecological balance of the planet  if this concept is to be valid  it will be essential to extend it to the industrialized countries so as to make it possible to determine whether the production and consumption patterns they follow can be sustained from the environmental point of view  it will be essential to establish close co-operation among all countries in efforts aimed at the research and development of new technologies that will be more efficient in the utilization of natural resources and will cause less pollution of the environment  moreover  firm commitments for the transfer of technology at cost will have to be established. The importance we attach to the problem of the environment and the Brazilian readiness to deal with it objectively and openly are clearly reflected in our readiness to host the United Nations conference on environment and development in 1992.Brazil is more keenly aware than any other country of its exuberant  rich and extraordinary natural world  its forests  its fauna and flora. We will not give up our right to preserve this rich heritage. We preserved it in the past  when the large colonizing companies formed in the rich countries invaded the wild areas of Africa  Asia and America  brutally despoiling them. Brazil rejected them. It forbade them to enter. During the 1960s  the Hudson Institute conceived the idea of a vast lake which would flood Amazonia. Brazil rejected the idea. If the world today is able to turn its attention towards Amazonia  it is only because Brazilians were able to preserve it up to the present day and will continue to preserve it for the future. We are prepared  as we have always been  for cooperation. But we will never be prepared to accept restrictions upon our sovereignty.With the programme known as ""Our Nature""  we have already been able in a single yea  to reduce the fire-clearing of forests by about 40 per cent  we have banned the export of timber  we have eliminated the incentives for projects which have proved to be predatory  and we have created the Institute of the Environment  in which dozens of organizations have joined in a broad project for ecological Protection. Approximately 8 million hectares of Brazilian territory are now subject to a regime of permanent conservation. Approximately 10 per cent of the national territory is reserved for the total indigenous population of 200 000. At the same time  Brazil is viewing with great concern the problem of drug trafficking and illicit drug production and consumption. We took an important step forward in 1988 with the adoption of the Vienna Convention. The constantly growing dimensions of the problem make it urgent for the United Nations General Assembly to turn its attention to the adoption of effective measures of cooperation.Brazil will make every effort to contribute  along with the consumer  producer and transit countries  to the eradication once and for all of this serious threat to our societies  we are pursuing a vigorous preventive policy in this field. With our -Northern Basin"" programme in the Amazon  we have been occupying and patrolling our extensive frontiers in order to help the local population and to prevent the entry of drug traffickers escaping from other countries. We are maintaining control over the trade in precursors. We are waging  unremittingly  a war on drugs. The picture I have painted leads us to contemplate the qualitative transformation of our world.The ideological confrontation which has governed international events throughout this century is showing clear signs of abating. Irreconcilable opposition is being replaced by understanding. Ideologies are losing-their emotional content as the advances of science and technology disclose growing prospects for human well-being. It would be Utopian to imagine a world totally free from conflict  but I do not think it nonsensical to think of a rational world in which co-operation and understanding replace confrontation and dish money  a world in which it will finally be possible to build peace on the solid basis of a universal community of interests  a world in which the democratisation of international relations will lead to the overcoming of power politics.The fundamental difference between the United Nations and its predecessor  the League of Nations  is precisely the awareness of the right to development. That is the ideal that constantly inspires the Economic and Social Council and the Organization as a whole. The League of Nations sought to establish international order  which was no small task  but the United Nations aspires to something more: it seeks also international justice.Henry Adams declared that so-called practical politics consists in ignoring facts. I am afraid that comment is applicable to the mentality currently prevailing. We need the boldness to advance new concepts  the pioneering spirit to develop new approaches  the courage to carry out new institutional experiments. Let us hope that the decade of the 1990s and the United Nations will be able to think about the problems assailing mankind on the eve of the year 2000.Our century has not grown old in vain. There are some who attempt to characterize it as an end of history. According to them  the world - and the rich world in particular - is destined to live through a long period of historical inertia made up of prosaic pleasures and mediocre satisfactions. The price of eliminating violence would apparently be cultural lethargy and the political laziness of an age without convulsions but also without ideals. That view amounts to a denial of human experience.  New countries such as our have the feeling of standing on the threshold of an age of great changes. The historical process is now in full bloom. We envisage a mankind free from antagonisms  threats and fear  opening up frontiers for a new kind of man who can achieve the goal of creation  conceived in the image of God. Two years ago  Brazil had the honour to be elected by this assembly  after almost two decades of absence  to membership of the Security Council. These have been for us two years of intensive participation in the Council's work. That experience prompts some reflections. If the United Nations  acting through the Security Council  is to be able to perform the prominent role expected of it in the field of international peace and security  some changes must be made in the structure and procedures of the Council itself. How can we solve important problems relating  for example  to the establishment and financing of peace-keeping operations without re-examining the very adequacy of the composition of the Council?That is a problem that deserves to be examined not only from the traditional standpoint of establishing a proper relationship between the number of non-permanent members and the increase that has taken place in the number of states members of the UN  but also - and especially - in the light of the changes in power relationships that have taken place since the organisation was created. The time has come for changes. We would consider an additional category of permanent members that would not have the veto privilege. New circumstances on the intentional scene - in particular the easing of Political and ideological confrontation - unquestionably open up possibilities for  a more efficient utilization of the United Nations. But that must not mean a return  pure and simple  to an excessive predominance of the super-Powers over the Organization. The United Nations certainly cannot do without consensus between the super-Powers as the basis for effective action. In many cases  however  that consensus will not be enough. Contributions by other Member States may be necessary  and even indispensable  if the Organization is to be able to act effectively and responsibly as a truly international institution.The time has come to make development and justice the foundations of world peace and stability. This Organization was created as the result of the struggle against totalitarianism  and represents the most advanced level of achievement in terms of democratic relations among States. We must therefore take advantage of the opportunities afforded by ideological demobilization in order to dedicate ourselves with renewed vigour to the great causes of international co-operation  we must dare. -Dare if you dare - said the Portuguese poet Pernando Peszoa. I propose that the united Nations commit itself to a process of broad and total dialogue on the major problems of these closing years of the century in order that we may enter the twenty-first century with an awareness of the challenges that face us and of our potential. Prom disarmament to the environment  from the banning of chemical weapons to the transfer of technology  from democracy as an instrument of stability and development to civil rights and political freedoms  from economic reforms to international trade  from the regionalization of the world economy to the new faces of interdependence  from the conquest of outer space to the eradication of poverty  we are faced with challenges that invite discussion. We must go to the source of our problems  understand them in all their complexity  face their consequences without vacillation  take the necessary decisions and eliminate the factors of de-stabilization and inequality.Let us act before it is too late  before sacrifices and frustrations crystallize into rebellion  before the satisfied people of the world in their complacency become insensitive to the just demands of those who have little or nothing  before room for negotiation is reduced by mutual fear and intransigent confrontation.No country or group of countries  no matter how powerful  can claim to be in a position to solve the crisis alone  with an open mind  without mental reservations  resentments or ulterior motives  let us set to work  perhaps there will never again be a moment in history in which ideological demobilization will offer such favourable conditions. Let us be capable of transforming reality through the creative power of ideas. We call upon everyone  and especially the more powerful  to join in that task. It is not too late to salvage the dream of peace and justice dreamt by past generations.At the opening of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  I wish to leave members with a message of optimism and determination  the same message which inspires Brazilians  who have taken a hand in their own destiny through the democracy they have succeeded in building.It is Brazil's strength of belief that has enabled it to consolidate a new democracy in our America  triumphing over many challenges. It. is For the same reason that Brazilians express their views here  through the voice of their President  to dream the dream of peace and justice  exorcizing fear and raising altars to hope.As a politician and an intellectual  I have never regarded poetry as an uninvited guest at the assembly's plenary meetings. It is with poetry that I take my leave  with the verses of Luiz de Camones  the universal poet of the Portuguese language: ""After the storm  tempestuous and drear And shadow of night and shrieking winds that blowComes on the morning hour  serene and clear With hope of harbouring safely from the woe."""
"21",998,"BRB",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  I am very pleased to see such a distinguished son of Africa receive the honour of presiding over the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. The bonds between our two countries  Nigeria end Barbados  are of long standing  rooted in a common past  enriched by Ð° common drive to uplift our peoples and un weakened by the distance that separates us. We know intimately of your personal skill and flair in diplomacy. I unhesitatingly pledge the full co-operation of my delegation during your tenure.May I also take this opportunity to thank your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for his skilful chairmanship and guidance throughout the forty-third session.Since the birth of the Organization some 45 years ago the world has made considerable progress. The age of high technology is with us. Many countries of the industrialized world have achieved high standards of living and substantial material advancement for their people. After more than three almost-uninterrupted decades of direct and indirect confrontation  the leading nuclear Powers have begun to beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into priming-hooks. With that development has followed an apparent weariness with conflict-by-proxy across the far readies of the globe There seems to be a genuine universal desire to participate in the search for peace.It is  however  incumbent upon the super-Powers to ensure that this new dimension in their relations is no passing phenomenon  no short respite while arsenals are refurbished and economies restructured. It is our hope that the developments of the past two years are the basis for lasting global peace. Star the peoples of the non-industrialized countries these trends present a unique opportunity for us to pursue our development free from the encumbrances of ideological conflict. We must remain vigilant however  and be determined that we never again become unwitting pawns in the deadly games of the not-too-distant past should there be a retreat into the old ways of super-Power rivalry. We must be ever vigilant  because many of the major problems that confront us today have no ideological solutions in the interdependent world in which we live.And yet  in spite of the considerable progress the world has made  there remains a stubborn residue of problems that are as intractable today as they were half a century ago. For a large number of the world's population so little has changed in past decades that their development objectives  however modified  remain basically the same  For them  their economic and social problems are still their most urgent problems  and none of us can possibly say they are within sight of solution. There is still far too much degrading poverty on the face of the Earth. There are large inequalities in wealth within nations and between rich and poor nations. There are glaring gaps and disparities in the provision of housing  health and education for a substantial part of the world's population. There is the soul-destroying sickness of apartheid in South Africa and the lingering disease of racial intolerance and prejudice in many countries of the world. There are discord and conflict in the Middle East and smouldering embers of strife in South East Asia.There ought to be no question that the struggle for economic advancement and social development of the non-industrialised nations of the world should be one of the urgent and consuming priorities of international life today.The current international problems of debt  protectionism  the net reverse flew of financial resources  global warming  threats to the Earth's ozone layer  creeping deserts  pollution and other forms of environmental degradation  destruction wrought by hurricanes and other natural disasters  ANDS  drug abuse and the illegal traffic in drugs - all compound the plight of the peoples of the developing world.I take this opportunity to express Barbados' sympathy with the countries that were recently ravaged by hurricane Hugo  particularly our sister countries in the Caribbean  and to urge the international community to co-ordinate and provide material support to the countries in need as a matter of urgency. I trust that these experiences will serve as an impetus to the international community to give its full support to the proclamation of the international decade for natural disasters.Our responses to the challenges presented by the countless problems I have mentioned will be a test of the resilience of the multilateral system. Just as national development demands nothing less than the transformation of a society and its economy  so too in an interdependent world will economic and social development necessitate the transformation of attitudes in the international community and the transformation of the international economy. It is clear that the prescription calls for joint  co-operative and consensual action and responsibility if lasting solutions are to be found  solutions that do not themselves create more critical problems.The foremost lesson to be learned in adherence to the principle of multilateralism is the danger of believing that any single country or group of countries can alone command the way forward or has exclusive insights into the way our relations on this planet should be shaped. Our history is replete with examples that reveal that that attitude oÂ£ mind has prevailed in the past  needless to say with disastrous consequences. In the final analysis everyone is searching for the way forward; from the smallest to the biggest  from the weakest to the strongest  everyone has a contribution to make in this process. For small developing countries like Barbados there is really no alternative to the multilateral process. We have no capacity to project military might beyond our shores. We command no great influence in the total scheme of international economic relations. But we have one means of making our voice heard at the global level that is through our contribution to the multilateral process and our appeal to fairness and equity in international relations.We therefore urge the nations of the world to return to true multilateralism as the only effective way to meet the challenges of promoting and ensuring what has been described as self-sustaining  international economic growth and development t and a restructured economic system of co-operation. In relation to international debt  the record of action so far emphasizes the need for a global conference to look at the question of debt in all its dimensions. The ad hoc end piecemeal measures which have been put forward so far are clearly not addressing the problem in the timely and comprehensive manner that is necessary  failure to involve all parties  including particularly the private commercial banks  has produced obstacles to the full implementation of the various proposals  resulting in half-hearted efforts at implementation and less than full coverage of those affected.In addition  the emergence of new centres of economic power and the prospect of new patterns of trade and investment make such a conference even more vital. Any further delay in holding the conference will only increase the already intolerable social costs being borne by indebted countries as they strive to repay their debts. It is certain that the terrible effects in terms of social upheaval and dislocation will be fait far beyond the confines of the national borders within which they occur.In relation to the environment  it is heartening that there has been a fairly quick decision on a global approach to the problem. The General Assembly will have to work hard at this session to ensure that the preparations for the 1992 conference on environment and development are placed on a sure foundation. Even at this stage  however  some ideas can be offered about what Barbados would like to see emerge at  and from  the conference.Barbados hopes that  as a minimum  some concrete measures will be agreed upon to enable developing countries to contribute more fully to the efforts to protect the global environment. We recognize that sacrifices will have to be made by all countries  but it is only equitable that the developed countries  which are in a better position to do so and which have contributed significantly to the present environmental problems  bear proportionately a larger portion of the burden.  Above all  arrangements to protect and preserve the environment must ensure that the legitimate aspirations of the developing countries to create a better life for their people secured.I am happy to report that Barbados and its sister States members of the Caribbean Community have recently taken steps to create mechanisms at the regional level for ongoing consultation and co-operation on environmental matters which are of paramount interest to us all.In relation to illegal narcotic drugs  it is clear that efforts to eliminate this menace will be doomed to failure unless they reflect the will of producer  consumer and transit States alike. So far  activity has been concentrated on efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs to consuming countries.Efforts  however  to reduce and eliminate the demand for illegal drugs have be   not nearly as concerted and  as a result  not as effective. It has become evident that catchy slogans  although they serve to focus attention on the issue  are not sufficient. It will be necessary to direct much more effort and resources towards education to spread the message of the dangers of narcotic drugs for it is only when the demand of consumers is reduced that the core of the problem will have been reached. Equal emphasis will need to be placed on rehabilitation programmes to reclaim those who have become the victims of drug abuse. These measures are essential if the long-term dimensions of the drug problem are to be addressed.Barbados' concern with the dangers of illegal drugs has been all the more heightened because our principal resource is our people. Barbados lacks large deposits of minerals  vast rivers and forests. It has been through the ingenuity of our people that some measure of progress may be seen in our development efforts. Our women in particular have played a significant and leading role in these development efforts. Thus  any factor which reduces the capacity of our people to fulfil the tasks of development is an attack on the very foundations of our existence as a nation. My country is in the process of adopting comprehensive measures aimed at effectively combating and halting the illegal traffic in drugs in Barbados. However  the efforts of individual countries need to be buttressed  and we commend regional and multilateral efforts.In this regard  I wish to pledge the support of Barbados for the courageous and resolute efforts of President Virgilio Barco and the Government and people of Colombia to free their country from the grip of narco-terror. We support  too  the initiatives presented by the Governments of Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica aimed at excising the cancer of illicit trade in drugs and we urge the international community to join in this support.The scourge of ANDS  like drug abuse and drug trafficking  respects no borders. It is vital that in the fight against ANDS the international community deploy all the resources at its command. Above all  it is imperative that developments in science and technology be made available to all countries if the universal battle against ANDS is to be waged successfully. The choice is clean we unite- or perish.Developing countries like Barbados are engaged in an interminable struggle to ensure that we are not left behind in the evolution of the global economy. There is an unfortunate trend for developed countries increasingly to coordinate their policies in key economic sectors without involving a range of the developing nations which will ultimately be affected by those policies. Barbados fully supports the efforts at consultation among those with the greatest capacity to effect change in the international economy. We feel  however  that such co-ordination should more fully take into account and reflect the views and concerns of those with the greatest needs.Certain factors should govern the transformation of the global economy. Foremost among these is the unequal capacities of developing and developed countries to make the necessary adaptations. The developed countries are better able by far to adjust to the new realities; indeed they are helping to create the momentum for change. It is vital  therefore  that the developing countries be helped to make the necessary adjustments; for it is only if the transformation of the developing countries corresponds to that of the developed world that a true balance can be attained which favours the majority over minority interests.This year we witness the celebration of the emergence and triumph of democracy in at least three countries. The Republic of Costa Rica will shortly mark the 100th anniversary of its democracy. The Republic of Prance has celebrated the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. We congratulate those countries. My own country  Barbados  is commemorating 350 years of Parliament. Our experience of 350 years of parliamentary government has taught us the power which resides in the hands of the people. Prom a narrowly constituted body reflecting the interests of a minority of colonists  the Barbados Parliament has been transformed into a truly representative institution in which the concerns of all Barbadians may be pursued. It is against this background that Barbadians can empathize with the aspirations of people throughout the world to become masters of their destiny  through freely and democratically elected representatives.This aspiration has burned strong in the breasts of the oppressed people of southern Africa. Change is on the horizon for Namibia after years of domination by the apartheid regime of South Africa. Barbados's long-standing commitment to this process of change is underscored by the deployment of a contingent of 21 Barbadian police officers in Namibia within the framework of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNIAG)  But the international community must remain vigilant lest  at the eleventh hour  the evil regime of apartheid conspires to snatch the prize of freedom from the grasp of the Namibian people. Certain ominous developments in Namibia only serve to warn of that possibility. It is therefore vitally important that the apartheid regime be told in no uncertain terms  especially by those to whom it must listen  that the international community will not be satisfied with anything less than freedom for the Namibian people.He must be conscious  however  that the achievement of political freedom is only the starting-point for Namibia's membership of the community of nations. Considerable financial and technical assistance will be necessary to place the country on the path to economic development. My country has in its small way tried to further this cause through regular contributions to the various funds for Namibia and the provision of educational scholarships for Namibians in Barbados. Barbados stands ready to continue and intensify the assistance which it has been giving to Namibians and urges all members of the international community to do likewise within their respective capabilities. He will have failed in our several responsibilities if we merely assist in Namibia's emergence as an independent nation under the shadow of apartheid's economic domination.The international community equally cannot relax until the stain of' apartheid is eradicated from South Africa and truly representative government is introduced in benighted land. He must not be fooled by the merely cosmetic changes which have been made in South Africa through the staging of totally undemocratic elections. That is merely an attempt to give apartheid a respectable face and prolong its existence as well as an attempt to lull the international community into inaction on the eradication of apartheid. But none of us  none of the nations which proclaim support for fundamental and inalienable human rights  the essential principles of justice and equality and the virtues of a democratic form of government can be satisfied until that odious system f apartheid is completely eliminated. For while the situation in South Africa lingers it remains an obstacle to world peace.The hunger for peace is evident in the decision reached by the five Presidents of Central America at their meeting in August in Tela# Honduras. Barbados has long supported the principle of applying regional solutions to regional problems. We have on several occasions and in various forums reaffirmed out support for  and commitment to  the peace initiatives launched by the Contadora Group. We pledge our support for the peace process  which has now been given a renewed impetus  and call upon all States to do likewise.It is unfortunate that while it may be considered that some progress towards peace has been realized in one dimension of the Central American problem  elsewhere on the isthmus tension and strife are steadily increasing. A series of unfortunate events has dealt a serious blow to the hopes of the democratic forces in Panama. Following the abrupt suspension of the democratic process in the presidential elections held in Panama in May this year  the Prime Minister of Barbados  the Bight Honourable Erskine Sandiford  issued a statement voicing Barbados concern that any deterioration of the situation in Panama could lead to an escalation of tensions in the region with the gravest consequences for the peace and security of the hemisphere. He expressed the view that the democratic nations of the hemisphere could help to resolve the crisis in Panama by insisting that any solution must be consistent with respect for human rights and authentic democracy on the basis of fair and free elections  with the sovereign right of the Panamanian people to determine their own destiny free from external intervention  with the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties  and achieved through peaceful negotiations. Once again we urge all States to work within these parameters for the rapid and. peaceful resolution of the crisis in Panama.The international community must also renew its efforts to bring peace to that long troubled region  the Middle East. Barbados believes that  Î¹ international conference on the Middle East offers the best hope for a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Middle East question. Peace will continue to be an elusive objective until the desire of the Palestinian people for a homeland and the right of all States in the region to live within secure boundaries. He urge those in authority to fulfil the responsibilities which are theirs by virtue of their power and to move swiftly to the table of internationally sponsored negotiations and so end the deadly cycle of violent.Barbados agrees with the view that the United Nations system represents manâs loftiest hopes for a better future. As a mechanism for solving problems the United Nations system is without parallel. It provides opportunities for a cross-fertilisation of ideas  and its Charter  notwithstanding the criticisms levelled against it  offers the most comprehensive guidelines for international action yet crafted by man.For all its potential the united Nations system can do no more than the will of the Member States allows. It is therefore imperative that we fulfil our obligations to the Organisation  No longer can its operations be held to ransom through non-compliance with legal obligations regarding payment of contributions. Solemn undertakings must not be cast aside in the pursuit of national objectives. the United Nations is not to be supported when it suits narrow national interests and simply shunted aside when it does not.It is clear  however  that the reform of the United Nations system must be carried forward speedily if its operations ace to be placed on a sound and secure footing for the future. In relation to United Nations peace-keeping activities it is clear that in the last two years demands on the Organization have increased considerably. As negotiated settlements are reached in one conflict area after the other  it is likely that the United Nations will be called upon to act as guarantor of the peace again and again. If the United Nations is to fulfil in the most efficient manner the demands being made upon it then some attention must be paid to enhancing its capacity in the area of peace supervision. Only in this way can we hope to avoid some of the difficulties which have been evident. In addition we must counter the forces which would see the United Nations as e mere shield  a cover for the pursuit of national interests as opposed to the interests of the world community as a whole.I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have given their lives in the service of the United Nations. Humankind cannot afford to ignore the possibilities which have been afforded us for a brighter tomorrow. To do so would be to condemn ourselves to repeat the mistakes of past decades with perhaps even more severe consequences for life on this planet. Barbados is convinced that if these opportunities for peace and development are to be exploited to the fullest they must be brought fully within the ambit of the United Nations system} they must not be left to the vagaries of changing personalities and alliances  or continue to exist at the level of bilateral or only partially multilateral relations. Our future action must also more fully reflect a commitment to certain principles and objectives. Those that come quickly to mind include: a renewed commitment to the process of consultation  the broadening of co-ordination in the economic sector  the equitable sharing of burdens and responsibilities; the search for comprehensive  as opposed to partial  ad hoc and temporary solutions to problems; the intensification of support  for the economic recovery of developing countries; greater attention to the human dimension of development; respect for basic human rights over narrow national concerns; and the fulfilment of the aspiration of all peoples to self-determination.Those are not new ideas. I certainly claim no right of authorship over them. They have been around for a long time  unfortunately more often ignored than recognized. I believe the success of our efforts to bequeath a better world to succeeding generations will largely depend on our commitment to those principles.As we look back on the developments that have taken place in the recent past  we have cause for hope. There is an atmosphere of optimism  albeit cautious at times  that great things are within the grasp of mankind if only we put our minds and energies to the task of achieving them. As we face the future we can draw sustenance from the belief that a new era of peace and development can be ushered in on this planet.The peoples of the developing world aspire to far more them mere survival. They deserve a. nobler destiny  a concept justified by the high moral obligation to recognize the inherent equality of all human beings and to acknowledge that there is dignity in the human reason and that every living soul on the face of the Earth deserves an equal opportunity to strive  and to achieve  and to create a more just and humane world. "
"22",1030,"BRN",44,1989,"ï»¿At the very outset  I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your election to this high office is an expression of confidence in your great diplomatic skill and your wealth of experience that will contribute to a successful conclusion of our work. My delegation and 1 are confident that you will be able to give this session wise guidance.I also wish to extend our congratulations and thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for his excellent service as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. Our congratulations and appreciation also go to the Secretary-General for his unceasing efforts and devotion to his work for the United Nations.As 1990 approaches  we are leaving behind a decade much of which has been characterized by a succession of international crises in many parts of the world. However  many fundamental changes and developments have also taken place in the closing years of the 1980s. The easing of tension between the super-Powers has gained momentum  as demonstrated by the summit meetings between the United States and the USSR and between the USSR and China. The drive for peace in many parts of the world has led to attempts by the United Nations and other regional organizations to resolve problems which in the last decade seemed insoluble.In Afghanistan  the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops  although a political settlement and durable peace remain to be achieved. In Namibia  the terms for a settlement have been agreed. We hope that very soon Namibia will be able to hold a free and fair election  and we look forward to welcoming Namibia in our midst as a fully independent and sovereign nation. The Iran-Iraq war hasstopped but the process of reconciliation has been very slow. As for South-East Asia  there are ongoing regional as well as international efforts to resolve the Kampuchean problem. We should continue to strive for a peaceful solution to the conflict.It is encouraging to note that the international situation has changed  bringing a new attitude to solving conflicts. There is a more conciliatory trend now. This is in line with the principles of the United Nations that call on its Member States to settle disputes by peaceful means. Hence  the principles of the United Nations have increasingly gained in importance as instruments promoting peace and stability in the world today. Furthermore  the current improvement in the world situation has been effected by the responsible attitude of Member States of this world body in respecting those principles. These developments should offer better prospects for peace around the world.It is a sad fact that the negotiation of disputes does not always guarantee complete peace and stability. In a number of cases  while negotiations have taken place  violent hostilities or rivalry between the parties concerned continue  and thus hinder a comprehensive solution  thus perpetuating the misery of the ordinary citizens. We have arrived at just such a position in the attempts to settle the problems in the Iran-Iraq war  Afghanistan  the Middle East and Kampuchea and in other cases. This does not augur well for the further improvement of the general world situation. In those conflicts where a comprehensive solution remains elusive  owing to failure at the negotiating level  the scourge of war will remain a threat. Peace is not merely the absence of war. Unless it is realized that the cessation of hostilities must be accompanied by a genuine desire to resolve disputes at the negotiating table  conflicts around the world will be far from being settled.I am particularly concerned that despite increasing international efforts  peace and stability have not been achieved in such areas as the Middle East  South Africa and Kampuchea.The Palestinian problem remains a matter of great concern to the international community. The cries for justice and freedom in the occupied Palestinian territories continue to fall on deaf ears. Despite world condemnation  Israel still continues to pursue its aggressive policy and to refuse to recognize the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Such a negative attitude especially towards the convening of an international conference  will only lead to the escalation of violence and fighting in the occupied territories. My delegation feels that the International Conference would be useful in bringing all parties concerned to the negotiating table. We also wish to reaffirm our view that the Palestine Liberation Organization should be included in the Conference as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinians.The intensity of the conflict in Lebanon saddens us. The international community watches in horror as the population endures daily carnage. While there is no simple solution to the 14-year-old conflict  we should not leave Lebanon to its own fate either. In the name of humanity  we urge those who have influence with the opposed parties to continue to find a way to aid the conflict. In this regard  I welcome the effort of the Arab League to appoint a tripartite commission.Another depressing problem that continues to challenge this world body is the apartheid system of the racist regime in South Africa. The regime not only arrogantly and stubbornly refuses the international calls to dismantle its evil system but also uses a policy of aggression to oppress the black population. Thus  we would like to repeat our support for the international community in calling on South Africa to stop its racist policy of apartheid and to grant the black majority of the South African population their basic rights to equal opportunities and equal participation in the political process. In this connection  we would also like to reaffirm our support for the imposition of mandatory and comprehensive sanctions on South Africa in order to put greater pressure on the regime to end its oppressive policy of apartheid.In our own region of South-East Asia  it is regrettable that the recent International Conference in Paris did not succeed in bringing about a comprehensivesettlement of the problem of Kampuchea. Once again  the parties concerned in the conflict could not agree on the elements and terms for a lasting peace. The unilateral withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea this month will not guarantee peace and stability in Kampuchea  unless there is an answer to the question of the provisional or interim authority  from which the process of national reconciliation and assurances of the observance of the peace process should evolve. At the Paris Conference the parties concerned did not speak the language of reconciliation-  rather suspicion and rivalry predominated.The lack of success should be attributed as much to the absence of political will and unwillingness to compromise as to the failure to subordinate sectional interests to greater national interests. Testing each other's strength on the battlefield in order to arrive at a solution is a dire option which would have disastrous consequences. However  despite the absence of progress in the recent International Conference on Kampuchea  the fact that it has taken place reflects the continued commitment of the international community to resolution of the long-standing problem through peaceful means. It is vital that we should not abandon that commitment to the finding of a peaceful comprehensive settlement.Today I have pointed out some areas where some progress has been made and where disputes could be settled peacefully through negotiation and I have stressed the importance of pursuing negotiation as a better means of ending conflicts than settling them by force. We are all aware of the attendant difficulties  but it is our wish that this option of settling disputes by peaceful means should prevail. And so we call on the parties concerned to show the necessary political will and we call on all members of this body to support the United Nations efforts to achieve the peaceful solution of conflicts wherever they may occur."
"23",1113,"BWA",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of my delegation and on my own personal behalf  I wish to extend our felicitations to you  Sir  upon your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session. Your great country  Nigeria  and my own enjoy the warmest of relations  it is our conviction that with your immense diplomatic skills you will ably guide our deliberations. Please be assured of my delegation's unwavering support. I take this opportunity also to convey our gratitude to your predecessor for a job well done during the last session. The forty-fourth session has convened at a time when he mood in international relations is still characterized by the spirit of detente. Relations between the super-Powers have continued to improve. Some measure of co-operation has been clearly demonstrated in finding solutions to regional conflicts. We note in this regard that the independence process in Namibia is registering significant progress.It is our earnest hope that the momentum will be maintained and infused into the outstanding political issues that confront us. The United Nations has played a key role  and the Secretary-General deserves our encouragement to carry on with this impressive work. Be that as it may  much still remains to be done mainly in the socio-economic sphere. The trade imbalances between the rich North and the poor South is as bad as it has been in the past  if not worse. The decline in the prices of commodities continues unabated. Hunger  poverty  disease and other social ills remain the order of the day in third world countries. With this background in mind it is for the Assembly at this session to revisit the issues  and to reoriente itself to proffer meaningful solutions. In this connection I believe that we can only succeed if we resolve to work together to find common solutions to world problems.As I mentioned earlier  significant progress has been registered in international politics. The two super-Powers have moved ahead in the spirit of detente. Important steps such as the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - have raised new expectations that disarmament in both nuclear and conventional arms may be pursued earnestly and purposefully. It is our desire that more of such brave measures will be undertaken. Any positive development in international relations is hound to produce a snowball effect even in other areas. Such developments have our blessing and encouragement. regional conflicts whose escalation we have always feared to be a potential for another international conflict appear more on the decline  thanks to the atmosphere of rapprochement between the super-powers and the very important role played by the United Nations. To date the loud and haunting guns of the Gulf have been silenced after spelling death  misery and disaster in that part of the globe. We are hopeful that peace will be allowed to prevail. As for the situation in Afghanistan  we regret that the Geneva Agreements which were concluded last year under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General have not been observed and carried to their logical conclusion.We call upon all parties concerned to abide by these Accords. The Afghan people should be encouraged to lay down their arms and move to the negotiating table without fail to embark on national reconciliation and reconstruction of their country. The situation in South-East Asia is hopefully moving in the right direction. The spirit of the recent international conference held in Paris on the question of Kampuchea  particularly the withdrawal of foreign troops  would  if honestly pursued  usher in a new phase in the long-drawn-out quest for peace. We trust that this initiative will not be lost  as the people of Kampuchea are yearning for peace and national reconciliation. There should be no return to the killing fields of the 1970s.Similarly  we call upon all concerned to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the question of Korea. Both North and South Korea desire a peaceful reunification of their divided country. Let us help them to achieve that objective.Botswana welcomes the peace process launched at Tela  Honduras  by the summit meeting of Heads of State or Government of the countries of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Honduras  Guatemala and Nicaragua. These are indeed encouraging signs towards the freaking of the stalemate in Central America. We call upon all concerned to assist in the promotion of this initiative.We note with concern that the situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate despite the peace initiatives taken by Palestine to accept Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which initiatives cleared the way for a peaceful resolution of the Middle East question. It is now for Israel to reciprocate if peace is to be achieved. What now stands in the way of peace is Israel's acts of aggression in the region  its human rights violations against the Palestinian people and its refusal to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).Botswana still pins its hopes on the peaceful resolution of disputes. That is why we support the idea of convening an international conference on the question of the Middle East at which the PLO would be allowed to participate on an equal footing. In Lebanon we continue to witness untold killings and counter-killings and the wanton destruction of property. Botswana holds the view that the people of Lebanon must be assisted to stop this fratricidal war and the destruction of their country. We call for the removal of all foreign troops and other occupation elements. The Lebanese people should be allowed to resolve their differences without external interference.Cyprus still remains a divided and unhappy island of people who desire peace and national unity. We call upon the two parties concerned to breathe life into the process of resolving differences through peaceful means  in this regard we encourage the holding of more purposeful consultations through inter-communal talks. Let no effort be spared to foster the noble goal of achieving peace and unity. In this vein Botswana stands by its conviction that all foreign troops must be removed from Cyprus. Southern Africa continues to be in a state of war. while we can register same Progress on the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  on the independence of Namibia  much remains at stake on all other fronts. Apartheid  which is the root cause of the problems in our subregion  remains intact. The front-line States and other neighbouring countries continue to endure South Africa's acts of aggression and destabilization. Our citizens live in fear for their lives and the destruction of their property. Bomb scares and actual bomb blasts continue to occur in Botswana. Refugees under our care remain targets for South African security forces or commando murder squads and ordinary civilians are victimized in the process. We do not expect much improvement in this situation until apartheid has been totally eradicated and replaced by a democratic system. That is our only hope for peace and stability in southern Africa.As indicated earlier  some progress is being registered on the independence process in Namibia  but we remain concerned about a number of obstacles to the holding of free and fair elections. Instead of demobilizing all Koevoet members  the South African Administrator-General confined to base only 1 200 members. He has pledged to reactivate them if he feels there is a need for them.Koevoet is notorious for its brutality during the independence war. It continues to be a symbol of harassment and intimidation and should not at this time be used for the maintenance of law and order  it is with the foregoing in mind that we condemn the recent cold-blooded murder of Anton Labowski as a dastardly act. Another source of serious concern is the electoral proclamation  which has been described by many as ""seriously flawed"". The system proposed is complex and therefore subject to abuse. A more simple  universally used and time-tested procedure that can be understood by the people of Namibia should be adopted. There certainly should be a common voters' roll prepared region by region. Ballots should be counted at the centre where voting has taken place. That will ensure speedy announcement of results and reduce the risk of fraud and loss of or tampering with ballot boxes during transportation to Windhoek.Namibians have waited for their independence for a long time  and they should be assisted to achieve it. The international community has worked hard to bring the process this far. Our efforts should not be in vain. We must  therefore  as individuals  as pressure groups and as Governments  do all in our power to ensure that free and fair elections are held in Namibia so that that country can proceed to independence.In Angola there are promising signs that the civil war that has ravaged that country ever since its independence some 14 years ago my come to an end. The reconciliation talks under the mediation of President Mobuto Seko Seko of Zaire offer prospects for an end to the war. violations of the cease-fire are a source of concern. We appeal to the parties concerned to rekindle the spirit of Gbadolite and undertake to rebuild mutual trust. We also believe that recriminations and acrimony will not help. Everything must be done to make the work of the mediator effective  and nothing should be done to tarnish the mediator's integrity. We call upon those in a position to do  o to persuade UNITA to re-enter the negotiations with a sense of purpose. The people of Angola have suffered long enough as a result of the war. They want peace and development in their country. The Mozambican Government also has agreed to negotiate the ending of the war with the RENAMO bandits. President Arap Moi of Kenya and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe have agreed to act as mediators. Church leaders in Mozambique are trying to act as special envoys between the two sides. Their work is not being made easy by RMAMO  which continues to murder and maim innocent civilians even after the declaration of a cease-fire. The untold suffering imposed on the people of Mozambique by RENAMO should not be allowed to continue. Mozambique is very important to us in the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). Since Botswana is a member of that regional organization  whose objective is to forge regional economic integration and reduce dependence  especially on South Africa  I know how much the war is costing all of us. Despite international assistance and support to the Maputo harbour and railway system  that corridor remains virtually closed to traffic because of REM WO activities. The whole region is being denied the use of a deep-sea port  and Mozambique the revenue the reform. The situation in South Africa itself remains unchanged. The abhorrent and violent system of apartheid continues. The authentic leaders of the black majority remain incarcerated or in forced exile. The state of emergency remains in force. Peaceful demonstrations are met with brutal force. On the day of the white elections 23 innocent people were reported killed by the security forces and over 100 hurt. The situation remains very tense  particularly in and around Cape Town. Unfortunately  the full extent of the tension cannot be known because of official Press censorship. Church buildings and church leaders are not being revered in a country that professes to be God-fearing. Despite the violent repression unleashed against them by the security forces  the people of South Africa are still seeking ways and means of finding a peaceful alternative to apartheid. Through the mass democratic movement they are organizing peaceful defiance campaigns to end apartheid. They are taking the Government at its word that apartheid is dead. Their demonstrations seem to be well organized  peaceful and dignified. They go out of their way to avoid provoking the trigger-happy State security forces  but the police always find some excuse to attack them. That two demonstrations recently received the presidential nod seems to signal a hesitant softening. The South African Government must be bold. The oppressed majority of black people have on those occasions demonstrated that they can be self-disciplined. On 21 August 1989 at Harare  Zimbabwe  the Organization of African Unity adopted a 24-point Declaration on measures to end apartheid. The Declaration had been formulated by the front-line States with the assistance and involvement of the people of South Africa through their liberation movements. That Declaration enjoys the popular support of the people of South Africa. It really demonstrates that the oppressed majority remain committed to the peaceful eradication of apartheid.In his campaign statements Mr. F.W. de Klerk spoke about his desire to end apartheid. He requested to be given five years to address the South African situation  although he did not give any indication of what exactly his plans entail. His statements have attracted considerable attention and raised hopes in some quarters. His eagerness and his ability to meet foreign leaders have also attracted attention. In certain quarters he is seen as a reformer who must be given a chance. We hope he means what he says and that he will soon put South Africa on the road to civilization. Botswana would wish to encourage him to start the process of dialogue from within South Africa itself. He has to talk to the leaders of the oppressed majority. Charity begins at home. In thanking the white electorate for having voted his party into power give full political rights to all South Africans. Those are noble words that must be matched by concrete action. The oppressed majority has already declared its serious Intention to negotiate. We urge him to take this challenge very seriously indeed. In this regard. Mr. de Klerk should create a climate conducive to negotiations by releasing all political prisoners and detainees  by ending the ban on political parties and other anti-apartheid organizations  by lifting the state of emergency and by removing the army from the townships. The protection of the so-called group rights  for which Mr. de Klerk is calling  cannot he helpful to that process  as it is apartheid by another name. Universal human rights and adult suffrage are the hallmarks of true democracy. Until free and fair elections are conducted for all the people of that country  there should be no let-up in the guest for peace and democracy in south Africa. Apartheid must be abolished completely  not reformed. We must establish a democratic non-racial society in south Africa.Vestiges of colonial domination still dot our globe  with painfully slew movement  if any  towards decolonization. We call for freedom and Justice for all colonial peoples. In that connection we call for the speedy implementation of United Nations resolutions relating to the question of Western Sahara  to the Comorian island of Mayotte and to New Caledonia. In each case we believe that dialogue rather than force should be used to settle any differences between the parties concerned. It is in the same spirit that we encourage Argentina and Britain to resolve their differences on the question of the Falklands/Malvinas through negotiations. We do not in any way prescribe what they should negotiate.The world economic system shows little signs of improvement. The recently released report of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) indicates that international trade has registered some 8 per cent growth  owing in part to technological innovations. But the irony of it all is that the registered increase does not affect third world countries. They still suffer hardships owing to the continued decline in commodity prices and to protectionist practices of the industrialized countries. Efforts by developing countries to acquire capital  science and technology from the developed countries have been frustrated. Our economic dependence on the developed world has thus increased. The debt crisis is of particular concern to developing countries. We have to service the immense external debt from the meagre resources which accrue from the sale of our primary products. Most of our economies have  ultimately  registered negative growth rates  while some have stagnated. Traumatized as we are  we have not been spared a moment to think of a way out of our predicament which would be consistent with our individual socio-political circumstances. Instead  prescriptive advice under the umbrella of structural adjustment programmes has been given us by some of the so-called experts within the circles of international financial institutions and donor countries. While structural adjustment programmes may be necessary at times  as we in Botswana have noted  they should not be regarded as a panacea for all our economic problems  as this attitude sometimes results in the ""cure"" being worse than the disease. In our view  there is a need to consult the countries concerned and take into account their socio-political condition  without imposing anything on them.The critical economic situation prevailing in Africa should be viewed against this backdrop of an adverse international economic climate. The programmes envisaged under the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development (UNPAAERD) have so far not been implemented. African countries still face some degree of anguish. It is desirable  therefore  for the international donor agencies and financial institutions to redouble their efforts to help out in this pitiful situation. Failure to do so would mean a perpetuation of misery  hopelessness  at times death. Botswana shares the hope that developing countries may be able to maximize their economic development by way of economic integration. For our part  we are working tirelessly within the ambit of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference to realize this lofty goal. We therefore call upon the international community to give us the necessary support in this endeavour. On the social side  there is a need for all of us to pool our resources to combat the menace of drugs and drug trafficking. Our youth is being turned into a generation of addicts and social misfits. Similarly  joint efforts are desirable in our fight against the killer disease AIDS. We  the entire family of Man  need to rise above the level of our national boundaries and address with vigour these physical and social ills which threaten humanity.Economic development cannot be separated from environmental issues. Our development plans must take full account of the possible consequences of our activities and be environmentally sound. We are concerned that the ozone layer is being depleted and that desertification continues unabated. Also  we deprecate the dumping of toxic and nuclear waste  particularly in the territory of developing countries. In that light  Botswana sees great value in mobilizing all our resources to combat this menace. We urge that there should be a common resolve to find more meaningful solutions to environmental problems.In conclusion  I wish to make the observation that some measure of progress has been achieved in the political sphere  but that much remains to be done in the economic sphere. I believe that we can make meaningful progress in both areas if we all co-operate.Finally  I wish to reiterate my delegation's best wishes to Mr. Garba in his presidency of this forty-fourth session."
"24",1202,"CAN",44,1989,"ï»¿In view of your remarks  Mr. President  I am a little embarrassed but I would like to extend to you my congratulations and best wishes as you assume your important duties as President of the current session of the General Assembly. The wisdom and the understanding that you bring to this position is well suited to these historic times. I am also confident you will do great honour to the legacy left by your predecessor and my good friend  Dante Caputo. Before beginning my main remarks I want to comment on two particular developments of relevance to the United Nations. The first concerns the application of modern technology to the challenge of peace-keeping  in April of this year  Canada completed a comprehensive study the purpose of which was to explore the utility of all forms of aerial surveillance to the peace-keeping tasks now before the international community. The conclusion of this study was that these overhead technologies - satellite or airborne - could significantly increase the efficiency of peace-keeping operations and related verification endeavours. This study will be submitted to the United Nations for its consideration. I believe this is an important development both symbolically and as an achievement in its own right. It is the sort of pragmatic  concrete work necessary to allow the United Nations to handle its ever-expanding peace-keeping responsibilities more effectively  it also symbolizes one of the fundamental purposes of this Organization: harmonizing the wonders of modern technology to the tasks of peace-making and not war-making.The second development on which I would like to comment is the readiness by Canada  if asked  to supplement the United Nations presence in Namibia by sending trained and respected police forces. Canada enthusiastically supported the idea that nations should help meet the urgent requirements for skilled policing in Namibia. We are ready to send members of our national force  the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  who have played such a decisive and constructive role in our own history.They were  in effect  Canada's first peace-keepers  in 1874  in one of the actions which made us a trans-continental nation  the North-west Mounted Police marched west across 1 000 miles to establish by their presence the rule of law in the Canadian west. They brought order  not force  and by their conduct established a respect that endures to this day and has made them one of the most admired police forces in the world. They would carry to Namibia not only their skills  hut their reputation as keepers of the peace.This would be the first time in Canadian history that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has undertaken such a role and in order to be ready  their Commissioner has asked for 100 volunteers. So far  2 000 members have responded to that call from a total force of over 14 000. We believe that Canadian Mounties  Who  more than a century ago  brought a universal respect for law and order to our own West can extend that tradition to Namibia  as that new nation finally comes of age. This is an unprecedented and challenging period in world affairs. On the one hand  there is real movement on problems that not long ago seemed intractable. That is true in southern Africa  in Indo-China  in parts of the Middle East and  most dramatically  in East-West relations.At the same time  the sense of crisis becomes more acute. Our climate is changing  bringing drought or inundation or other threats to our very survival. New diseases develop. New technologies allow proliferation of the most deadly weapons. Terrorism becomes more widespread. What is common about these problems is that none of them can be solved by one nation acting alone  nor by one group of powerful nations combining their will.In the past  we assumed the world could survive man's worst excesses. Now in an age of suitcase bombs  the AIDS pandemic  holes in the ozone layer  there is doubt about that elementary ability to survive. There is doubt  but not despair -indeed the opposite of despair  what marks this period in world affairs is an activism and a pragmatism which yield surprising results and they come together here in the United Nations.We are entering an era where the words of the United Nations Charter must cease to be goals to which we aspire  they must become descriptions of our common actions. And the term ""United Nations"" cannot simply be the name of our institution  it must become a statement of our common purpose.Who  today  can imagine a nuclear war in which there are winners and losers? Who can envisage a conventional war in Europe which does not consume the prize? Who can construct a solution to the debt crisis which does not involve compromise? Mho can foresee a cleaner global environment without international co-operation and joint action? And who can imagine a resolution of the many crises in the developing world without a reasoned and productive dialogue with the developed world? In the past it was the adherents of unilateralism who were known as realists and the advocates of co-operation who were labelled idealists. I submit that the reverse is now the case. Co-operation is now the new realism and pragmatism is the path to progress. Much has been accomplished in recent months and years  much more remains to be done. Within the East-West relationship there is a new  willingness to abandon sterile linkages and to seek solutions to tractable problems even when other areas remain contentious. This welcome attitude has invigorated this institution and brought hope to many conflicts and regions of the world. We encourage its continuance.Arms control is now characterized by real compromise and give and take. Problems which are truly acute are being addressed first. Areas where technology threatens to overtake politics are being given priority and the unnecessarily large and undesirably unstable balance in conventional forces is finally being dealt with head-on. Canada warmly welcomes the significant progress made in recent days by the United States and the Soviet Union on a variety of fundamental issues. In particular  movement towards the abandonment of the linkage between research on strategic defence and progress on strategic nuclear arms control is a very positive development. So too is the progress registered on eliminating chemical weapons  including the exchange of data on stocks. We strongly welcome President Bush's offer to reduce stockpiles to less than 20 per cent of current levels while efforts continue in Geneva to negotiate a chemical weapons convention.Canada endorses also the United States and Soviet agreement to explore an open-skies arrangement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact. Such an arrangement would be daring in its simplicity  yet path-breaking in its consequences: an agreement that the aircraft of each member of both alliances could enter the airspace of the other alliance subject only to basic air-safety regulations. That would increase the assurance of every member that military activities were not becoming preparations for surprise attack.From the beginning  we have urged the United States to move forward with this visionary proposal  and to make it an alliance-to-alliance arrangement. An open-skies agreement would be a compelling symbol of the new East-West relationship  it would build confidence and serve as a useful vehicle for the verification of other agreements  including an eventual agreement on conventional forces in Europe.We are prepared to go beyond moral support. On Sunday  after consultations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact  Prime Minister Mulroney announced Canada's offer to act as host to an inter-alliance conference as early as November  in order to explore the possibilities of a formal agreement on open-skies. It is of fundamental importance to deepen and widen East-West relations. A stable structure of peace cannot endure if its only component is concurrence on arms control  no matter how far-reaching that agreement might be. Enduring peace requires understanding  a sense of shared problems and a shared stake in the future. Above all  it demands a sense on each side that the survival of the other is in its own best interests. What is required is agreement not only on the avoidance of war but also on the advantages of peace. Therefore we welcome and encourage the broadening dialogue on regional  economic  social and environmental matters.It is for that reason that Canada has strongly supported expanding the field of activity of NATO to pursue more energetically the alliance's mandate for political and social dialogue. In that connection  during NATO's most recent summit  a Canadian proposal was adopted to assist young political leaders in learning how to make democracy work. More initiatives of that type are required.The progress in East-West relations owes much to the refreshing breezes of change sweeping Eastern Europe and the USSR  ideology is giving way to compromise. Governments are recognizing that the old ways do not work  that new strategies are required  that lessons may be learned abroad  and that co-operation in the economic and social spheres does not constitute an acknowledgement of defeat but is rather a recipe for success.Canada's support for the changes now underway in the East is unequivocal. There must be no turning back  and that requires imagination in the West as to practical ways to strengthen the remarkable process of reform and liberalization. In the Eastern bloc and elsewhere around the world  the turning towards democracy and the expansion of the market-place is a welcome victory for pragmatism and realism. Totalitarianism is fading not because it is regarded by its subjects as wrongs it is being discredited because it does not work  it does not deliver.Democracy is not only a set of values  it is also a statement that there is no monopoly on truth  that different groups at different times may have different solutions to different problems. It is the politics of pragmatism  it works. It delivers  a free market is not simply a particular means of ordering the economy. It is a framework that enables the individual to act on his or her own merits. efforts  and capacities  it conforms to human nature. It is the economics of pragmatism  it works  it delivers  it is for that reason that Canada welcomes the tide of democratization and the shift to the market-place evident around the globe. On that trend rests the hope for social stability. And such stability is a firm foundation for international peace.The past months have seen remarkable progress in many regional conflicts that have posed serious threats to global stability and caused untold sorrow for their victims. The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan  the settlements in Angola and Namibia  the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war  and the progress evident in Central America: all are testimony to a new willingness to compromise. They are also testimony to the crucial role played by the Organization end by its Secretary-General in the search for global order. Much more needs to be done. There is a difference between the absence of war and the presence of peace. The international community must continue to do everything in its power to ensure that the processes now underway in those troubled regions move from truce to settlement  from stand-off to stand-down.We believe it is particularly important to maintain the pressure against apartheid. There are real reasons for encouragement. President de Klerk has promised reform and has demonstrated both flexibility and imagination. The African National Congress has shown courage and foresight in preparing itself to participate in genuine negotiations  popular demonstrations in South Africa  and their tolerance by the authorities  reflect a popular will that reaches across colour. International attention and the use and threat of sanctions have contributed to this climate of change  and they must not be relaxed until substantial reform is in place. Even today  children starve and adults perish as old conflicts born of hatred and greed continue to fester  cheating future generations and defiling the honour of ancient civilizations. In Lebanon  blood continues to be spilt in a tragic struggle for domination in that once noble land  while is now being destroyed by those who would be its ruler. We renew the call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and reiterate our strong support for the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League. In the Middle East  there is an urgent need for confidence and dialogue. We support Israel's proposals for direct elections in the occupied territories  we welcome the moderation evident in the positions of the Palestine Liberation Organization. But much more confidence-building is needed on both sides if these initial gestures are to be translated into a meaningful peace process for that troubled and war-ravaged region. Canada welcomes President Mubarak's imaginative 10-point plan as one avenue out of the current impasse.And in Cambodia  the recent International Conference in Paris failed to Produce an agreement  owing to many outstanding difference between the parties. It is to be hoped that the future will bring compromise before that land endures yet another bloody conflict. However  I believe the Paris Conference served a positive Purpose: it has put the issue firmly on the international agenda and identified international control mechanisms and reconstruction processes that can be brought into play when a settlement is reached. As some regional conflicts have been brought under control  the unique and important United Nations instrument of peace-keeping has been brought to bear. At the same time  welcome and pragmatic suggestions are being made to improve operations and funding. Canada supports the Secretary-General's call to provide Peace-keeping with a rational and secure funding base. Peace-keeping has become too important to the mission of the Organization to be subject to charity or whim.One of the central tasks of this Organization has been to weave a new fabric of international law. This it has done assiduously  often without fanfare. The foundation is being laid for an international society governed by legal principles and codes of conduct. As with domestic society  stability is not possible without law  and law is powerless without consensus. The integration into domestic law of the rights codified by the United Nations in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the covenants on racial discrimination and the rights of women is testimony to a growing international consensus. We must build on this success by acting this year to approve the Convention on the Rights of the Child.We are witnessing today a profound transformation in the substance of international discourse. Issues once thought intractable are now remarkably close to resolution. And issues once considered the province of domestic governments are now the focus of international activity. These are on the international agenda because they are pressing and because no State  no matter how powerful or well- intentioned  can resolve them on its own.Thus the environment is emerging as the most important international challenge of the remainder of this century and the next. In a very few years  the environment will be seen as a threat to human existence in the same way as nuclear war has been regarded in the past. It is now a challenge to national survival. It is also an area where the distinction between the domestic and the international agenda is collapsing. Pollution knows no borders. In the end  we all share the same air and water-  we all suffer from its corruption or its loss.Let us agree during this session of the Assembly to hold the proposed Conference on the Environment and development in 1992. Let us move forward towards a convention on climate change with regard to which Canada has played a leading role in the development of a United Nations draft. And let us start a realistic dialog between the developed and the developing world on the environmental scourge which threatens all states  rich and poor. I detect today a new and welcome change in the stale and unproductive state of relations between North and South which marked the 1970s and the first part of this decade. There is growing recognition that grand. vague visions must give way to pragmatic dialogue  and that attribute  blame does little to solve problems.  In fact  without fanfare  without grand initiative  a new process of dialogue has already begun between the developed and the developing world. In the Cairns Group  diverse entries such as Canada and Thailand  Australia and Argentina have joined together on agricultural issues. international financial institutions  the debt crisis is being approached with a new spirit of realism and a sense of shared risk. Economic prescriptions are now plain  married with political and social considerations. This sensitivity is required if fledgling democracies and fragile societies are not to collapse over the wrenching effect of debt repayments. In the Commonwealth  a multiracial and global membership has allowed for increasing pressure against apartheid. In La Froncophonie  new programmes to preserve the French heritage and promote distance-learning are emerging  and human rights are now on the agenda for the first time. And within the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  there is a refreshing determination to put ideology aside and seek practical co-operation with the developed world. I attended the Summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade as a guest. I did so in search of common ground on a variety of international Issues. 1 was pressed by the new spirit of moderation shown by many makers  as I was by the wise and deft chairmanship of Yugoslavia. I quote from their Final Declaration: We are not to be burdened with prejudice or dogma."" I attended the Summit Conference not because Canada is questioning its alliances - we are a proud and permanent member of NATO and we are committed to a market economy and liberal democracy - rather  I attended because Canada happens to share a world with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.At Belgrade  I took the opportunity to explore further the proposal made by India  Egypt  Senegal and Venezuela during the Paris economic summit for a serious and responsive dialogue on issues of concern to us all. Canada  along with France  supported that proposal in principle at Paris. I reiterate that support now  and suggest some variations that may make the concept more effective. we should all learn from the mistakes of our past  set aside our differing world views  and come together  collectively and calmly  to discuss particular problems those resolution we all seek.Canada believes it is useful to encourage intensive consultations leading to a new conversation between the developed and the developing world  a conversation on focused issues  with a view to arriving at joint action for a common cause. Conversation  not confrontation. We cannot remake the world. But we can - and we must - redress the errors of the past - methodically  pragmatically  realistically and collectively.Discussions on the environment  on drugs  on investment  on trade  on debt  are all worthy of early pursuit. The agenda should be balanced  covering issues of interest to both the developed and developing world  we will be pursuing this question actively in the months ahead with our G-7 partners and the developing world  soviet involvement in this effort would be welcome  giving them the opportunity to act further on their interest in contributing to the international order  it would also reflect the universal nature of this challenge.In this connection  the coming year will provide two opportunities to encourage this new dialogue: the special session on the revitalization of Growth and Development-  and the elaboration of the fourth international development strategy. These two events can contribute to a new understanding of the basis for sustained economic growth and development  particularly for developing countries. The challenge before us today is to alter our traditional behaviour at an unprecedented rate  faced as we are with a planet showing so many signs of use and abuse. We know only too well the litany of global horrors before us: a burgeoning global population whose size will expand by almost 3.5 billion in 35 short years-  an ailing environment whose forests are dying or disappearing  whose air is being poisoned  and whose oceans and rivers are becoming dump-sites and cesspools; 14 million children dying each year from common illness and poor nutrition? a generation debilitated by drugs  the world trade in which now exceeds the value of trade in oil and is second only to the arms trade-  dozens of economies unable to pay simultaneously for past mistakes and develop a successful future; the proliferation of weapons - chemical and nuclear  as well as the spreading technology of weapon-delivery systems - creating a time-bomb which threatens the relief we now feel at the new-found co-operation of the super-Powers.This Organization  like other international assemblies  reflects the world from which it draws its Members and its mission. There have been many successes: the quiet but spectacular victories of UNICEF  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World Health Organization; the triumph of peace-keeping  50 000 participants in which so deservedly received the Nobel Peace Prize; the mediation of disputes  so honourably presided over by the present Secretary-General. But there have also been failures  opportunities lost to dated ideology and the lack of political will. The challenge posed by the future is not to invent new institutions but to make this United Nations family of institutions work more effectively and humanely. We are in a new type of race  one in which we will either all be winners or we will all be losers Let us lay to rest the worn out stereotypes of the past. Let us  	put aside our differences and work forth-rightly for a secure global future. Let us consecrate ourselves anew as united Nations. And let us confront squarely the problems of our era as men and women aware of the challenges before us  mindful of the consequences of failure  and dedicated to solutions that will work  not to dreams that will die."
"25",1263,"CHL",44,1989,"ï»¿I wish  first of all  to convey to the Ambassador of Nigeria  Major General Joseph Garba  our congratulations on his election as President of this General Assembly. His talents as a diplomat guarantee a substantive contribution to the success of these sessions.We also wish to acknowledge the positive presidency of his predecessor  the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina  Congressman Dante Caputo.We also desire to extend our congratulations to the Secretary-General  Ambassador Javier Perez de Cuellar  and his colleagues  for their effective peace-making efforts.We are pleased that these meetings are being held under the presidency of a representative of the Africa* continent. My Government has always been interested in broadening its relations with the peoples of Africa. It has steadfastly maintained its condemnation of apartheid aid all other forms of discrimination. They are offensive to human dignity. As you know  Mr. President  our ties to Africa are due to the United Nations  especially through our participation in the Committee on Decolonisation and in the United Nations Council for Namibia. We note with satisfaction the progress being made towards the attainment of independence for that Territory.The Chilean Government wishes to express satisfaction with the renewed vitality and effectiveness of our Organization  which represents a reiteration of the commitment of the international community to the principles of the United Nations Charter.We likewise note that the new relationships that are being established between the super-Powers are contributing to an improved international political atmosphere. The gentle winds of understanding are opening the way to a better world. Of course  our sense of optimism is not limitless. We continue to have serious concerns with regard to the grave problems which are threatening the peace or which are adversely affecting developing countries.Regional armed conflicts  poverty  the drug traffic  lack of access to world financial markets  obstacles to international trade  destruction of the environment are problems that still exist. There has been progress towards better understanding but the opportunities for well-being do not reach the great majority of humanity.As a country that is part of the American community  I wish on this occasion to stress again our solidarity with the peoples of Central America  a region harassed by the action of foreign interests.My Government also views with profound regret the prolongation of the tragedy afflicting the Lebanese nation. We support the appeal for peace in that region made by His Holiness John Paul II. We are convinced that all non-Lebanese troops should be withdraw from that territory.Violence continues to distress the peoples of the Middle East. We feel this very deeply because many descendants of the Arabs and the Israelis are part of our Chilean society.There is no rest for those who champion the cause of peace and the rights of man. Whenever we begin to think that progress is being made in troubled areas  strong forces of reaction threaten that progress. We are still concerned therefore about the citizens of Turkish origin who are being persecuted in Bulgaria. Chile reiterates its support for the universality of the United Nations  and would therefore welcome the desire expressed by the Government of the Republic of Korea for membership in this Organization.We regret the prolongation of the Cambodian drama. Despite the progress there  we feel that much remains to be done to enable the Cambodian people to recover their right of self-determination and freedom.In addressing the representatives of the peoples of the world I do so with the satisfaction that comes from speaking in the name of a nation aid a Government that are taking an historic step  overcoming both major domestic and external obstacles. Thanks to the efforts and determination of each and every Chilean  we have built a new society based on political and economic freedoms. From the depths of the crisis that affected us between 1970 and 1973  we have rebuilt our democracy and a strong and prosperous economy. On more than one occasion  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Chile has explained to this Assembly the process we have been following in establishing a secure democracy and a strong  developed economy. We have also announced in advance the precise dates  forms and stages for achieving the transition to full democracy  in accordance with the constitution which was overwhelmingly approved by the voters in 1980 - and the improved text of last July received the broadest popular support in our political history.There were those who did not wish to acknowledge the power of the rebirth of democracy in Chile  because it meant the end of the totalitarian regime of the ""Popular Unity"". There were also those who did not believe or who questioned the sovereign decision of my Government and my people to establish a free and progressive society. We were the object of discrimination  a double standard and irrational hostility  and then  in the face of Chile's undeniable progress  a conspiracy of silence arose. Only recently has Chile gained the international understanding and recognition its historic achievements deserve. The disinformation  ideologization and scepticism that distorted my country's image have finally given way to objective reality. There has been a positive change within the international community in its attitude towards Chile. The combination of political and economic freedoms is a reality in Chile and stands as the principal achievement of the Government of President Augusto Pinochet.From adversity  Chile has emerged strengthened. We have shown that foreign pressure cannot overrule the decision of a nation when its cause is just. We have learned that the sovereignty of nations is also a constant challenge. Finally  we have learnt that the only real collaboration between nations is collaboration which recognizes the independence and dignity of all States. The people of Chile is the only people which can choose what the destiny of the Chilean people is to be. Supported by accomplishments and facts  I can affirm that we have carried out what we proposed and what we promised. The Government of President Pinochet has made a reality of the objectives it set for itself in 1974. Freedom of the press  the activities of the most varied political parties  completely open public debate  full individual and trade union rights and economic improvement are  among other things  concrete expressions of a fruitful process of normalization which is not limited to recognition of civic freedoms but recognizes also those freedoms of a social  cultural and economic nature without which any society collapses into frustration. The progress Chile has been achieving in its economy and in modernizing its social structure ensures that democracy will not be a risky  fragile and Utopian adventure.Chile today is calm and peaceful  and the worth of moderation is new very clearly valued. Op to 1973  ideologized programmes had the upper hand; these were revolutionary in scope  and aimed to change society radically  ""today  on the other hand  only democratic parties have popular support and a chance at the polls.The progress Chile has made is not the result of foreign inspiration or aid. Chile owes its success aid its bright future to its people and its Government; they have worked hard and not turned from the path laid out by their opinions and traditions. We have a stable currency  sustained growth  controlled inflation and a balanced budget. We have put in place economic freedom that is stimulating the creative initiative of individuals aid recognizes the function of the market rather than the State bureaucracy in allocating resources. Chile's progress and the stability of its Government's policies inspire confidence in those doing business with my country. They know that our word is good  that we keep our promises and that our future belongs to our people.Progress in Chile has taken us to the threshold of being a developed country. I would like to give you some figures which reflect the sustained progress made by the Chilean economy: real growth in gross domestic product (<3)P) since the 1982 recession has an annual average of close to 6 per cent  and was over 10 per cent in the first six months of this year; more than a million and a half productive jobs have been created over the last five years  reducing the unemployment rate by half j in 1970  Chile exported 400 products to 58 countries  and is now exporting over 1 500 products to 112 countries? in 1973  Chile's exports totalled $1 305 billion  while exports in 1989 will exceed $8 billion; in 1986  the foreign debt peaked at $19.5 billion  and has since been reduced to $16.8 billion. In the social domain  expenditure has been concentrated on the sectors where there is extreme poverty  achieving successes which are the pride of all Chileans. For example  the health indicators show that the infant mortality rate dropped from per thousand in 1970 to 18.8 per thousand in 1988; life expectancy rose from 61.5 years to 71.8 years between 1970 and 1988> and the literacy rate has readied 94.3	per cent.The changes the world has experienced in the last 16 years have been wide-ranging and profound. The option Chile took in 1973 - its commitment to expansion and freedom - ran counter to many of the dominant trends in the economy and policy of that time. The same policies and sectors which failed in Chile towards the end of the 1960s and the early 1970s managed to establish themselves elsewhere  and now we are witnessing the collapse of the illusions offered by totalitarian and collectivist systems and their eventual demise. Peace itself seems to be gaining strength  and decisions by the main Powers are converging towards a greater degree of understanding and rationality.The world has become ever more interdependent. Knowledge and science  technology and resources are overcoming boundaries and artificial limits. The same phenomenon is occurring with problems or situations which affect the whole international community and therefore pose a challenge to world co-operation and to this Organization.One of the greatest challenges facing the international community is the challenge of effectively combating drug trafficking  a scourge which is corrupting society  the family and nations. We join with those Governments which have undertaken to combat such traffic  particularly the Government of Colombia for its courage in confronting the powerful criminal organizations which have taken advantage of that nation.Since 1973  Chile has kept the most severe manifestations of this problem under control through a rigorous programme of prevention. We are not a drug-producing country  but we have been the victims of the activities of drug traffickers. In September 1973  one of the first acts of the Government was to expel a group of foreign drug traffickers which  taking advantage of the political and social crisis in the country  had set themselves up in northern Chile.We are convinced that individual action by any one State is not enough: we must join forces. The world has declared war on drugs  but we must make it clear that contingency actions in this war will not solve the problem definitively. The permanent solution is education to strengthen our young people end alert them to the damage drugs do and programmes to help victims recover. To do this  the community of nations must allocate the necessary resources to implement effective education programmes.We have been expressing our concern about terrorist activities for years now. I should like to take this opportunity to repeat that we repudiate and reject terrorism. We Chileans are particularly conscious of terrorism. We have suffered from its cowardly  irresponsible attacks and more than once have seen how other nations allow the free transit of know terrorists claiming political immunity. If modern societies wish to overcome  once and for all  terrorism and narco-terrorism Which is threatening to engulf us all  we must act decisively. No nation should offer them shelter or facilitate their movements.On occasion  certain international organizations have permitted the human rights question to be manipulated systematically. Attempts have been made to politicize it and even to include the legitimate fight against terrorism and subversion under the phrase ""violations of human rights"". We are not disregarding in this context the inviolable rights inherent in every human being. But we condemn the gross manipulation of human rights which  at its very heart  demonstrates that there is no real respect for what is said -falsely - to be respected. Human rights must be respected by all nations without exception  but must not be manipulated.It is neither just nor balanced to make facile pronouncements on the painful events that some nations  such as Chile  had to experience in overcoming subversion and terrorist violence. In our case  these were the result of the political upheaval aid breakdown of our society from 1970 to 1973. We must bear in mind the root causes and the general context of the disruption of the peaceful life of our peoples.In Chile we have been able to build a society in which human rights are protected not only by democratic institutions and the rule of law  but also by Chileans' respect for each other's individual freedom  values and beliefs. Those rights are also protected by the spirit of understanding that prevails in Chile.For our part  we have decided to build a new future for Chile  and to accept the implications of our own past.In 1978 the Government of Chile adopted an amnesty law as the corner-stone of our efforts to pacify and unite the com try. Amnesty is the juridical course of prudence  of reconciliation and of commitment to a peaceful Chile - the common goal of the vast majority of the Chilean people. For the sake of the future of everyone  we believe it is necessary to put the past behind us  to heal rather than reopen wounds. The people aid the Government of Chile are firmly committed to continuing to advance on the road of unity and peace which they have always followed.International co-operation is the basis of peace and progress. The world is advancing toward the creation of expanded free-trade markets. An outstanding example is the European Community.We find reason for hope in the prospects that the twenty-first century holds for nations capable of facing the challenges of the future. That hope is based on the fact that the free-trade agreements will inevitably be extended to Latin America  which is moving forward in accordance with the prevailing trend towards greater economic freedom.Chile wishes to promote effective Latin American integration. It is necessary to modify the present approaches based on the artificial strategy of imports  restraint's on foreign investment  and regional markets strictly protected and regulated by the State. We believe that  instead  those approaches should conform to the prevailing trends towards privatisation  elimination of customs barriers  a free market and the negotiation of general agreements that would enable the region to swim with the tide of progress and to move towards ever-freer flows of goods and services offering opportunities to everyone. The conditions have been created for true regional economic integration that would expand the agreements reached in Latin America and the Caribbean.Chile has made every effort to accommodate its economy to those trends  convinced as we are that this is the preliminary step to the broad aid modern integration that will enhance Latin America's promising prospects. However  we also view those prospects with concern because the trade negotiations aid associations of the industrialized nations could become de facto protectionist barriers against trade with the rest of the world.The recent experience of the unfair embargo on the export of Chilean fruits - which  for reasons that remain obscure  was temporarily excluded from world markets - demonstrates not only the complexities of international trade  but also the danger of protectionism on the part of the developed nations  which can halt the exports of the developing countries aid inflict serious damage on their economies.Our peoples want to move with the great currents of world progress. They do not want to receive ""humanitarian assistance"" in exchange for protectionism  which maintains imbalances harmful to the developing nations. What we want is equality of opportunity  just and equitable treatment. I am sure that on the basis of such equal treatment and mutual respect my country and many others will be able to advance securely on the road of growth aid to meet the foreign-debt obligations which weigh so heavily on our economies.Nevertheless  a large foreign debt entails great sacrifices of our peoples' standard of living and slows production aid consumption in creditor as well as debtor countries. Everyone involved in this cycle must join forces to overcome it.It is not an exaggeration to say that the re-evaluation of the dollar  high international interest rates  and protectionism have been the direct causes of the present debt problem.A plan for co-operation and co-ordination between the industrialized nations has served as a complement to the Bretton Woods institutions. But in that co-ordination the interests of the developing world have not been adequately represented. The monetary discipline on the part of the industrialized nations that would take into account our countries' economic needs has not emerged.Chile's foreign policy is based on the principles of international law and on the goals of peace and co-operation. Those goals are linked not only to the promotion of the national interest within the community of nations but also to the promotion of the common good at the international level. In our country's actions in multilateral forums  we are firmly committed to the promotion of peace  friendship and co-operation between States.We are living in a dynamic era. But the enduring human values - truth  justice  equality and freedom - must be maintained.Present international relations are marked -- as they will also be in the future - by a growing freedom from ideologies; by the diffusion of power among many centres of decision-making aid influence; by the globalisation of relations between nations as a product of the clear and growing interdependence of all spheres of human activity  aid  finally  by the growth of a consensus on the role of the individual  his creative capacity and his initiative as the most dynamic elements in the social process.We are living in a new age. Some very difficult times  which seriously threatened the idea of co-operation between nations as well as human freedom  have been left behind. We have reason to be optimistic. Ahead of us lies a world of opportunities. Chile is determined to face the challenges with the decisiveness characteristic of young and confident nations."
"26",1309,"CHN",44,1989,"ï»¿Permit me to begin by warmly congratulating you. Sir on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly: I am sure that this session will be a success. I also wish to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the President of the last session  Mr. Dante Caputo. For his outstanding contribution in fulfilling his high mission.The past year has been marked by fresh achievements in the efforts of various countries to seek solutions to regional conflicts  reduce the threat of war and improve the international situation  and by new prospects for world peace. However  ours is not a trouble-free world. regional conflicts have not yet come to a halt. The arms race is still going on. Certain international contradictions have sharpened  owing to violation of the established norms of international law. The economic situation in the developing countries is further deteriorating. All this demonstrates that the source of world turbulence and tension still exists. The Chinese delegation would like to expound its position on the major questions confronting the world today. The first question is regional conflicts. regional conflicts affect peace and tranquillity in the world and have caused direct  tremendous losses  particularly to many third-world countries. As a third-world country and a permanent member of the Security Council  China is naturally very much concerned about the issue of regional conflicts. The Chinese Government has all along stood for a fair and reasonable political settlement of those conflicts  and has played a constructive role in this regard.In accordance with the Geneva Agreements on the settlement of the Afghan question  the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan. That is a positive development. Genuine peace  however  has yet to come to the land of Afghanistan. We hope that the various political forces there will set up a broadly based coalition Government through consultation and achieve peace in that land so that the Afghan people may rebuild its country.Iran and Iraq reached a cease-fire a year ago on the basis of mutual acceptance of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and each is now busy rebuilding its war-ravaged economy. We hope that these two developing countries  with which China enjoys friendly relations  will soon resume contacts and negotiations so as to turn their cease-fire into a lasting peace.The recent summit conference of the five Central American States has been well received by the international community  as it produced important new agreements on promoting the peace process in Central America. It is our hope that the United States also will respect the peace efforts of these countries. The smooth implementation of the agreements will benefit the stability and development of the region.Over the past year positive changes have occurred on the scene of southern Africa. With the start of the process of Namibian independence  the ultimate accomplishment of the historic mission of decolonisation on the African continent is now in sight. Angola has made headway in trying to bring peace to the country. The Government of Mozambique is working hard to end the unrest in its country. The Chinese Government has always sympathized with and supported the Namibian people in their struggle for independence. We hope that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and other relevant agreements will be seriously implemented and that the South African authorities will honour their commitment  so as to ensure the holding of a free and fair general election under effective United Nations supervision and to bring about Namibian independence as scheduled. We call on the international community to be watchful  to work to eliminate obstacles to the Namibian independence process and guard against any incident that may arise to the detriment of a free and fair general election.The Chinese Government has always supported the African countries in their just struggle against racism  and the efforts made by the front-line States and people in southern Africa to achieve peace and stability in the region and develop the national economy. We hope that their efforts will enjoy broad sympathy and vigorous support from the international community. The black people in South Africa are entitled to racial equality and democratic rights. We strongly demand that the South African authorities abrogate the universally condemned apartheid system  which is contrary to the spirit of our times.Since the last session of the General Assembly there has been an ever-stronger call for a political settlement of the Middle East question. The just struggle of the Palestinians living in the West Rank and the Gaza Strip has clearly demonstrated that the question of ending the Israeli occupation and solving the Palestinian issue with no further delay. The Palestine Liberation organization has adopted a series of flexible and practical policies  winning wide appreciation and support from the international community. It is high time the Israeli Government went along with the trend of history by replacing its rigid position by a flexible approach.The Chinese Government stands for a settlement of the Middle East question through political means without resorting to force. We support the convocation of the International Conference on the Middle East under United Nations auspices with the participation of the parties concerned  including the five permanent members of the Security Council. We appreciate the efforts of the parties concerned in the Middle East question to conduct dialogues of such diverse forms as they deem appropriate. We demand that Israel stop forthwith its suppression of Palestinian residents in occupation zones and that it withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. We hope to see mutual recognition between the State of Palestine and Israel  guaranteed security both for Arab States and for Israel  and the peaceful coexistence of the Arab nation and the Jewish nation. That  in our opinion  is the correct way to lead a Middle East long plagued by turmoil to peace and tranquillity.Together with the other justice-upholding countries concerned  the Chinese Government has over the past 11 years consistently worked for a fair and reasonable settlement of the Cambodian question. To that end the United Nations has adopted 10 successive resolutions. The Cambodian question arose as a result of the Vietnamese invasion. Therefore  a comprehensive settlement of the question calls for an end to the Vietnamese invasion and the removal of its consequences. That is the very essence of the successive resolutions adopted by the United Nations on the Cambodian situation  and it is also the consistent position of the Chinese Government. during the transitional period from the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces to the holding of a general election in Cambodia  the only way to ensure peace and forestall a dangerous situation in the country is to set up a provisional coalition Government headed by Prince Sihanouk and composed of the four parties in Cambodia. Cambodia should be restored to its independent  neutral and non-aligned status  while the countries concerned should provide an international guarantee for that status. Recently  the International Conference on Cambodia was held in Paris; it was attended by foreign ministers of many countries and leaders of the four parties in Cambodia. This in itself is of major significance  but regrettably  the Conference did not produce the anticipated results  owing to the rigid position taken by Viet Nam and Phnom Penh on the proposal put forward by the majority of the States participating in the Conference for an international control mechanism under United Nations auspices  the establishment of a provisional quadripartite coalition Government headed by Prince Sihanouk  and a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian question. As for the withdrawal of forces from Cambodia promised by Viet Nam  without the necessary international supervision people have reason to doubt whether Viet Nam has genuinely pulled out all its forces and military personnel of other categories. We hope that the international community will continue to follow the situation in Cambodia closely  render sympathy and support to the Cambodian people in their just cause  and keep working for a fair and reasonable ultimate settlement of the Cambodian question so as to remove completely this regional hot spot.The second question is disarmament.The past year has witnessed new progress in the field of international disarmament. The Treaty between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is being implemented. Positive results emerged from the International Conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons held in Paris last January. With the start last March in Vienna of. the negotiation on conventional armed forces in Europe and the subsequent specific proposals put forward by each side  long-deadlocked European conventional disarmament has taken a turn for the better. Moreover  the Soviet Union and some East European countries have decided to carry out a unilateral reduction in their forces and armament or withdraw some of them from abroad.Nevertheless  it is noted that the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union has not come to a stop. They continue to vie with each other in developing high-technology weapons systems and in going all out to upgrade their nuclear weapons and have even extended their arms race into outer space. So the halting of the arms race and the achievement of effective disarmament remains an arduous task.The international community expects the United States and the Soviet Union to shoulder their special responsibility for disarmament by taking the lead in drastically reducing their nuclear arsenals and conventional armaments and by stopping their arms race in all forms  including that in outer space. It is our consistent view that chemical weapons should be completely banned and thoroughly destroyed. At the present session of the General Assembly  the United States and the Soviet Union have made proposals on the question of chemical weapons. We hope that they will take practical steps to stop production and development of those weapons and destroy their existing stockpiles  so as to facilitate the conclusion of an international convention on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons.Disarmament is a question bearing on world peace and the security of all countries. Therefore  all countries  big or small  strong or weak  nuclear or non-nuclear  should have an equal say in the question  and each can play an active role. The reasonable demands and propositions of the many small and medium-sized countries ought to be respected  and full play should be given to the role of the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on disarmament issues. All this is highly necessary for the healthy development of the international disarmament process.The third question is the proper handling of State-to-State relations.Over the past year a number of countries have improved their relations with each other to varying degrees  which is a valuable contribution to world peace. What is particularly encouraging is that the Arab States have closed their ranks  in a spirit of conciliation. Countries in Africa are working for increased peaceful co-operation on that continent  while Latin American countries have made further headway in their regional co-operation.China has all along devoted its efforts to the establishment and development of friendly relations and co-operation with other countries on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence. The past year saw even better and stronger relations between China and many other countries  especially its neighbours.China maintains a traditional friendship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We are interested in peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. We support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's reasonable proposition on the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea  and wish to see positive results flow from the dialogue and contacts between the North and South of Korea. We have always enjoyed good relations with Pakistan  Bangladesh  Nepal  Sri Lanka  Thailand and many other neighbours in South and South-East Asia. We have normalized our relations with the People's Republic of Mongolia and Laos. Our relations with India are improving in many fields. The consultations on normalization of Sino-Indonesian relations are proceeding smoothly. The solidarity and co-operation between China and Arab States  African States and Latin American States have also made new progress.In May this year  China and the Soviet Union held a top-level meeting  thereby normalizing their bilateral relations. In a spirit of bidding farewell to the past and opening up the future  leaders of the two countries reviewed and summed up the history of Sino-Soviet relations and agreed to develop the bilateral relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. good-neighbourliness between the two big countries  China and the Soviet Union  is in the interests of not only their two peoples but also peace and stability in Asia and the world at large. This has been well received by the international community as it benefits the whole of mankind.China's relations with Western countries were on a course of steady development. However  difficulties of varying degrees have emerged over the past few months in our relations with certain Western countries. What has exactly happened? Has China acted contrary to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in its relations with these Western countries? No. Has China encroached upon their interests in any way? No. It is known to all that in late spring and early summer this year turmoil occurred in China's capital Beijing  which was aimed at subverting the Government of the People's Republic of China and overthrowing the socialist system stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic. It goes without saying that how to deal with this problem is China's internal affair. The whole world witnessed the fact that for almost two months the Chinese Government had exercised the utmost restraint and tried to solve the problem by persuasion and education rather than compulsory measures. It was not until the critical moment when the events had turned into an anti-government rebellion that the Chinese Government was compelled to take decisive measures to quell the rebellion. The overwhelming majority of countries in the world have expressed their understanding of this action by our Government. Only certain Western Governments  ignoring the facts and basing themselves on nothing but distorted news reports and misinformation  levelled unwarranted charges against the Chinese Government and applied pressure on it. It should also be noted that there is much evidence pointing to involvement in the above-mentioned events by some hostile foreign forces  which added fuel to the flames. They know full well what role they have played. In order to maintain State sovereignty and national dignity  it is only natural that the Chinese Government should have firmly rejected their meddling in the events in China and interference in its internal affairs  which contravene the norms governing international relations and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. In their statements at the General Assembly in the past few days  the delegates of some countries continued to attack the Chinese Government groundlessly. To harp on ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" while indulging in the habit of making arbitrary criticisms and imposing one's own will on others in State-to-State relations represents precisely the kind of behaviour that goes against the historical tide. This is indeed regrettable.The day after tomorrow  the People's Republic of China will celebrate its fortieth anniversary. For China  1 October 1949 is a day of great historic significance  marking the end of an era in which the Chinese people were subjected to every kind of national humiliation. Over the past four decades  foreign pressure on New China has never ceased  but what has come of it? New China is ever forging ahead. It has never feared  and will in no way bend to any foreign pressure. China's affairs can only be decided by the Chinese people  and China's policy can only be determined by the Chinese Government. Through long years of practice  we have found a development path suited to China's conditions  and we will continue along that path. We have formulated an independent foreign policy of peace attuned to the fundamental interests of the people of China and the world  and we will keep pursuing that policy. China will adhere to its policy of reform and opening to the outside world and continue to work for development of relations with other countries throughout the world.A normal relationship between China and a foreign country serves mutual interests  whereas in case of a disruption of such a relationship  China will by no means be the only one to suffer. Past experience has repeatedly proved that normal State-to-State relations can only be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China abides by these principles  and if other countries also do so  normal relations can certainly be established and developed between them. Herein lies the way out of the current difficulties in the relations of some Western countries with China.The fourth question is the establishment of a new international political order.Now that the world has advanced to a stage where most former colonies and dependencies have won independence  all States should treat one another as equals and an end should be put to hegemonic practice. Yet  facts show that hegemonic practice and power politics still exist. From time to time  there are cases in international relations  such as the big bullying the small  the strong domineering over the weak  the imposition of one's own will on others  or even armed encroachment upon the sovereignty of another State and damage to its territorial integrity by force. Should these acts which contravene the norms governing international relations remain unchecked  there can be no tranquillity in the world or guarantee of peace.With the concerted efforts of the international community  the world now witnesses a trend towards relaxation of tension and increased contacts among nations. This is a good thing. But meanwhile  in international contacts  there are still obvious attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries by various means in violation of the basic norms governing international relations. It is dangerous for State policies to be formulated and pursued with such attempts in mind  as it will detract from relaxation of international tension and lead to the continuation of the cold war. This is a question which merits the attention of the international community.On the one hand  there are vast numbers of countries in the world with quite different social systems  ideologies  values  historical backgrounds  cultural traditions and religious beliefs  and on the other hand  their interests predetermine the need for contacts with one another. Consequently  all countries are required to adopt a realistic attitude by recognising the diversity of the world  refraining from interfering in each other's internal affairs  and observing in their contacts the mutually accepted norms governing international relations. We firmly believe that such a world will be in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of all countries. I wish to use the forum of the United Nations to present this idea of the Chinese Government  hoping that statesmen of various countries will give it serious consideration when exploring the future of the world.The fifth question is the establishment of a new international economic order.For a long time developing countries have suffered greatly from inequitable exchanges  owing to irrationality in existing international economic relations. For them the recent years have seen worsening terms of trade  plummeting export earnings  dwindling production investment and heavy debt burdens. There has been even the phenomenon of reverse capital flow from poor to rich countries for many years running. So the tendency of poor countries to become poorer and rich countries richer is more pronounced than it was a decade ago. If allowed to continue  this situation will bring in its wake even more serious consequences for the whole world  including both the developing and the developed countries. The economic development of the third world has become a pressing issue affecting the global scene. Current international economic relations should not and cannot remain completely unchanged in the time to coma. The establishment of a new international economic order is the need of the times.In our view  the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should also be abided by in the conduct of economic relations between countries. A country's economic problems can be solved only by the government and people of that country with policies appropriate to their national conditions. Economic contacts between countries should serve friendly co-operation between them and not be turned into means of exerting pressure on other countries or interfering in their internal affairs. Any attempt to impose a certain economic system or developmental model on other countries and to interfere in the economic policies or development efforts of developing countries means power politics in the economic sphere  it runs counter to norms of international relations and the current historical trend and will not work in practice.To promote the establishment of the new international economic order in the interest of common development of all countries  what is urgently needed at present is a new round of truly substantive North-South dialogue with emphasis on solving the pressing problems facing the developing countries  such as debt  trade  capital and finance. We call on the developed countries to respond constructively to the proposals for reviving the North-South dialogue made by the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries held in Belgrade in Sept either this year and the Special Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 held last June in Caracas. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to growth and development  scheduled for April next year  will arrive at a fresh common understanding on future international economic co-operation and will provide a sound guideline for it. We also hope that the new international development strategy being worked out will offer effective measures in this regard.Protecting the environment has become a pressing issue of universal concern? it must be given full attention while efforts are made to solve the question of development. China has made the protection of the environment its State policy  we attach importance to and will participate in the United Nations conference on environment and development scheduled for 1992  and are ready to make necessary preparations for its convocation with other countries and relevant international organizations. We note with pleasure that  as the most influential international organization  the United Nations has in recent years had some outstanding achievements in facilitating the political settlement of regional conflicts  maintaining world peace  and promoting international co-operation and economic and social development. As a result  there is universal recognition of the importance of the United Nations. The positive efforts made by the Secretary-General have also won extensive acclaim from the international community.The final decade of the twentieth century is approaching. A new century is setting in  the times are progressing and the face of the world is changing. Like the entire international community  the United Nations is faced with unprecedented opportunities and extraordinary challenges. In order to adapt better to an ever-changing world  the United Nations needs to continue its own reform and further improve its efficiency. World peace and development need the United Nations  while the success of the United Nations depends on the support and co-operation of all its Member States. Together with the many other United Nations Member States  China is ready to fulfil the duties prescribed in the United Nations Charter and to contribute its share to a strengthened role of the organization in world affairs."
"27",1345,"CIV",44,1989,"ï»¿Sir  the superb qualifications we knew you to possess  the wealth of experience you bring to international affairs and to the United Nations  your commitment to the cause of peace  and above all that of your great country  Nigeria  to which Cote d'lvoire feels bound by so many ties of friendship and co-operation  constitute for us a whole series of reasons whole heatedly  to welcome your resounding election to the presidency of this session of the General assembly. Please accept my delegation's aid my own heartfelt and fraternal congratulations and our most sincere wishes for continued success.We also congratulate your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  who so efficiently  effectively and felicitously guided the General Assembly's work at its preceding session.Allow me  finally  to pay a special tribute - a well-deserved tribute  indeed - to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who has devoted a major part of his long and varied diplomatic career to serving and defending the noble ideals of peace and freedom  justice end progress  co-operation and solidarity embodied in the united Nations. The international community today welcomes aid reaps the fruits of his intelligence  perspicacity aid steadfast  tenacious efforts  as well as of his negotiating strength and skill and his persuasiveness  which have allowed the united Nations to restore its credibility and reaffirm itself as the focal point par excellence in the quest for the peaceful resolution of international problems. We should like to assure the Secretary-General once more of our complete confidence and unreserved support for him and for all the steps he has taken to ensure the triumph of these ideals.This session has begun in a particularly serene international climate fostered by the dialogue  built on confidence  engaged in for the past two years by the two major world leaders  the President of the united States of America and the President of the Soviet of Soviet Socialist Republics  a dialogue we are quite appropriately assessing in terms of its beneficial effects for the international political situation.The thick wall of fear and distrust is beginning to crumble  the dynamics of negotiation are increasingly replacing confrontation and the pitting of one side against the other  and conflicts are ebbing.Thus we have noted with relief aid reassurance the progress - inadequate  to be sure  but none the less significant and promising - made in the realm of nuclear disarmament with the commitment of the major Powers to do all they can to eliminate  under appropriate international controls  weapons of mass destruction that continue to threaten holocaust on our poor planet. Progress is also perceptible in terms of detente between East and West in the settlement of various regional or bilateral conflicts  as well as in the progressive elimination of the political oppression that is driving peoples to take recourse to force and violence to enforce their inalienable right to decide for themselves and to live in freedom and dignity.But this somewhat idyllic portrayal of the international situation must not lead them to overlook the darkness of the sky. At any time all of this can be called into question if we do not display enough imagination to resolve peacefully  andonce and for all  the conflicts that subsist and to find realistic ways to end the injustices that mark international economic relations and the anguish that is today the lot of the developing world.Before sharing with the Assembly my delegation's observations on some of the principal agenda items before this session  I should like to state once again the Cote d'lvoire's deep commitment to the united Nations and our full commitment to its noble ideals  which we are seeking to transform into an effective reality day by day  both within our country and abroad.Our unswerving fidelity to the principles we share with the united Nations does not allow us to indulge in demagogy nor to compromise our dignity on any pretext whatsoever. Let us be clear: Cote d'lvoire wants to be a friend to all. It scrupulously respects the sovereignty and dignity of others as well as their views and their approaches to various problems. Those may differ from ours  but  in the final analysis  such differences are minor  since we all have the same goal: to contribute  each in his own way  to resolving problems and to strengthening international peace and security. Is Cote d'lvoire not en titled to expect from others the same behaviour and the same respect?We are prompted today  as we have been in the past and as we shall continue to be in the future  by the sole concern to serve the noble cause of peace  in full freedom and independence  while giving pride of place to the virtues of dialogue and negotiation and resolutely opposing anything that might eventually lead to violence and war.Although we can justifiably welcome the climate of confidence that reigns in the world and the resultant lessening of international tensions  we must none the less recognize that certain situations still give us cause for serious concern. This is especially true in Africa  in Asia  in the Middle East and in Latin America  where the right to self-determination and the freedom to choose one's system are often put at risk or influenced by outside interference  by the hankering of some for power and by the lackey-like friendships of others.In Africa  it is reassuring to note that the dialogue we had been recommending since 1971 as the best means of resolving all disputes and conflicts  including the intolerable situation prevailing in the southern part of the continent  is today making progress and opening positive prospects for the future in that region.As far as the situation in South Africa in particular is concerned  it is obvious that we firmly and unreservedly condemn the abhorrent system of apartheid. However  while understanding aid supporting the struggle of our black brothers for recognition of their right to dignity  we continue to believe that dialogue and negotiation can foster understanding and mutual trust among the South African countries  and especially between the black majority and the oppressor white minority.It is clear  as the Secretary-General has stated  that a mere dilution or softening of apartheid will not answer the expectations of the majority of the people of South Africa nor of the world as a whole. We therefore once again urge the South African authorities to take the necessary steps to create without delay a climate propitious to true dialogue in South Africa  displaying the political courage required to eliminate  once and for all  the inhuman policy of apartheid that is preventing the harmonious evolution of South African society and compromising South Africa's relations with its neighbours  with Africa aid with the outside world.In this connection they must give still more tangible proofs of their resolve to turn the sad page of apartheid by unconditionally freeing Nelson Mandela  whose continued house arrest is totally without justification? by freeing all political detainees* and by granting freedom of expression to those movements opposed to apartheid. Lastly  we urge them to enter into dialogue with the black majority and to build the South Africa of tomorrow  a democratic  egalitarian and fraternal South Africa in which South Africans of ail races  backgrounds and faiths can live in peace  freedom and harmony within their common homeland  whose future they will guarantee and ensure together in a united Africa.Cote d'lvoire strongly urges the South African leadership to commit itself resolutely to that path  for the peace and concord of their country are at stake. It is up to them  and to them alone  to create the conditions for that indispensable dialogue  to which  we are convinced  our black brothers will be receptive. The Brazzaville and New York agreements entered into on 22 December 1988 by Angola  Cuba ad South Africa  with the mediation of the united Sates of America and the discreet but no-less-effective contribution of the Soviet Union  have made it possible to clear away the obstacles that have been preventing the effective implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia ad to faster the peaceful settlement of the situation in Angola.We welcome that. We express the hope that the process of Namibian independence may be concluded without further setbacks or intimidation so that free  regular and democratic elections may be held to enable the Namibian people finally to win back their full sovereignty ad their proper place in the concert of free nations.Despite years of heroic struggle against Portuguese colonialism our Angolan brothers are still  regrettably  not at peace  owing to the fratricidal war that is still unfortunately raging in their country after 14 years of hard-won independence. We welcome the 22 June 1989 Gbadolite declaration - in which the Angola leaders have proclaimed to the world their determination to put an ad to that lengthy civil war. A process of national reconciliation and negotiation has finally  after many ups and downs and fratricidal confrontations  made it possible to glimpse the outlines of a settlement to the dispute between Chad aid Libya  with the normalization in 1988 of relations between the two countries and the conclusion of the Algiers framework agreement of 31 August 1989.An era of understanding  tolerance  co-operation and renewed friendship between those two countries has thus been entered  in the best interest of their peoples. We pay tribute to all who have contributed to this happy outcome.With regard to the situation in certain countries in eastern and southern Africa  we welcome the relaxation of tension in those areas and the readiness of the Governments concerned to enter into talks with their opposite numbers aid their neighbours to restore peace and concord in their countries and to improve good-neighbourly relations.In Western Sahara the tireless efforts of the united Nations Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) have led to acceptance by the parties to the dispute  with certain reservations  of the proposed peace plan. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for having set up at united Nations Headquarters a technical commission to put the finishing touches on ways and means of implementing that plan which should enable the people of Western Sahara to determine their own fate through general and regular elections.we were grieved by the painful conflict that has recently caused a deterioration in relations between two fraternal countries  Senegal and Mauritania  with which we have solid ties of friendship and co-operation  both bilaterally in the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA) and in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We urge the Governments of those two countries to do all they can to promote the normalization of the many-faceted relationships their close proximity demands  in the interests of peace between their peoples aid of peace and co-operation in our sub region.In this connection we support the mediation efforts of the current Chairman of the OAU to achieve a peaceful aid just solution of that conflict on the basis of OAU charter principles.Other hotbeds of tension continue to command our attention. In the Middle East we feel that the situation will remain alarming so long as a peaceful political solution is not found to the Palestinian question  which is the core of the problem. To achieve such a solution  we have affirmed that to be lasting and viable any peaceful settlement in the Middle East must take into consideration the two inescapable realities of the region - the Israeli reality and the Palestinian reality. Reciprocal acknowledgement of these realities will create the climate of confidence necessary for the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue needed to achieve a negotiated settlement of the problem.I should like to take this opportunity to specify that my country was the first to proclaim  here from this very rostrum a few years ago  that the Palestinian question had to be considered and dealt with not only in terms of humanitarian concerns and of assistance to refugees driven from their land  but had also to be viewed as an essentially political problem to which a political solution must be found to put an end to the spiral of violence and to restore peace in the region.Given the imperative of peace  it was for us a matter of doing justice to the Palestinian people by responding to their legitimate aspirations: the free exercise of the right to self-determination and independence and recognition of their right to a homeland separate and independent from other States in the region whose existence - including that of Israel - will be assured and guaranteed.After many twists and turns  things have evolved to the point where today we can legitimately entertain the hope that the aspirations of that people will soon be achieved.The proclamation in Algiers in 1988 of the State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council falls into the logical trend we have been recommending for some time.We take note of the decisive steps taken in this connection by the Palestinian Command and its leaders who  in endorsing Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  have displayed their readiness for dialogue to achieve a negotiated settlement of the problem. We hope that the Israelis  for their part  will overcome their distrust and decide that dialogue is still possible with the Palestinians - the very people with whom they will one day have to coexist harmoniously on the land of Palestine they share.Hence Cote d'lvoire is in favour of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation  beyond that of the permanent members of the Security Council  of all the patties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  to take stock of the situation as a whole and consider the various plans put forward in order to give peace a chance in a region that needs it so much. Such a conference will  we hope  make it possible to arrive at an overall  just and lasting settlement of the situation in the Middle East  a settlement that will put an aid to the state of belligerence that has prevailed there for more than four decades and make it possible for Israeli troops to withdraw from occupied Arab territories  while guaranteeing the right of the State of Israel to exist and to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries  along with the national rights of the Palestinian people  including its right to a free and independent homeland with equally secure and recognized borders  with all the political and juridical consequences flowing there from. We have maintained aid continue to maintain at the highest levels the most useful contacts with the PLO and its leadership and with other States in the region. We intend to pursue them in the interests of peace and harmony in tine Middle East.In this quest for peace in that part of the world so dear to us all  how could we not cry out in indignation in the face of the tragedy that is unfolding in Lebanon  where a tolerant  engaging and ingenious people  because of divisiveness in its midst - something that invites foreign intervention - is being decimated by blind violence and dying. We endorse the appeals for a cessation of hostilities and an end to the brutal bombardment that is destroying human life and the infrastructure of the country. We support the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the League of Arab States to ensure that the guns fall silent and that negotiations begin among the Lebanese communities - of all political parties and all religious faiths - in order to define the basis for peaceful and fraternal coexistence within a reconciled Lebanon which would thus regain its unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence.Finally  we should like to stress the great merit of all those belligerents who have had the courage to renounce force and overcome rancour and hatred in order to sit down at the negotiating table and join in dialogue with a view to putting an end to the conflicts in which they were involved. Their courage has made it possible to achieve satisfactory results in the quest for peace in the world. Thus  the Geneva Agreements of 14 April 1988 made it possible for Soviet troops to withdraw from Afghanistan and the definitive settlement of this conflict now hinges cm scrupulous respect by the signatories for the provisions of these Agreements.Acceptance by Iran and Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) of 28 July 1987 and the cease-fire that entered into force on 20 August 1988 should  with the mediation of the united Nations Secretary-General  facilitate direct dialogue between the two countries with a view to settling the remaining questions and making it possible for them to normalize their relations.My country welcomes the peace and co-operation agreements entered into by the countries of Central America  in particular the agreement signed recently at Tela  Honduras. We support steps taken by the Contadora aid Support Groups with a view to establishing democracy and peace in that part of the world  free from any foreign interference.We encourage the resumption of dialogue between the two Koreas aimed at the peaceful reunification proclaimed in the Paimunjom declaration of 4 July 1972. We can see only advantages in having these two countries  with which we maintain excellent relations  becoming fully fledged Members of the Organization  something which could contribute to fostering this dialogue. Such a request from them would naturally receive our backing.We also support in Cyprus the dialogue between the Cypriot communities to restore the sovereignty  unity aid territorial integrity of that Member State aid guarantee its non-aligned status.With regard to Cambodia  the holding of the Paris international conference opened up new prospects in the process of restoring peace aid achieving reconciliation in that country. That process will be greatly facilitated by ending interference in the internal affairs of Cambodia  notably by the effective withdrawal under appropriate international control of Vietnamese troops  something that would reassure the Cambodian opposition and leave it up to the Cambodians of all persuasions to settle their own problems by way of fraternal and confident dialogue.As President Houphouet-Boigny is wont to say  peace is one and indivisible. It is over-arching  all-encompassing aid inseparable from development. Hence there can be no peace in the world if only one region enjoys peace and is awash in opulence while others are ravaged by war end plunged into poverty which is gaining more and more ground. That is why we believe that  while we must strive as hard as we can to consolidate peace where it is most fragile or most threatened and restore it where it has been destroyed  we must also put an end to the inequities and economic difficulties with which many of us are confronted so that we can equally enjoy the benefits of freedom and peace  the very basis of development.While we may now applaud the improvement in the international political climate - and we hope that it will continue - we must none the less recognize that the same is not true of international economic relations. The world economic situation is marked by an ever-widening gap between the developed countries and the developing countries  by the continued growth of the economies of the North  contrasting sharply with the great deterioration of the economies of the South  and by the imbalance in trade between a North that is getting richer and a South that is steadily growing poorer. That is caused by  among other things  the inexorable fall in the prices of raw materials  the constant worsening of the terms of trade and the heavy debt burden  which  in the final analysis  means a net negative transfer of capital from the South to the North.The situation is particularly worrying for the African countries facing economic and financial difficulties so serious that their economic aid social structures  so patiently built up  are in danger of crumbling. If energetic measures are not taken to allow those countries to resist the trend and at least to subsist  they will be plunged into anarchy  disorder and instability  threatening the social peace that is vital to ensure their development. It is our duty to ensure that that does not happen.Explaining his thoughts on the matter  President Houphouet-Boigny said recently in Dakar  at the francophone Summit  that just as""the man who is hungry is not free  a country that does not lead a normal life because its economy is in danger  it has a crushing debt burden  its trade is threatened and its modest resources are shamelessly exploited - in brief  a poor country that is kept in that state by speculation - is not a free country.""That is indeed the reality of our situation in Africa today. Our political independence and our freedom  so dearly bought  will have no true dealing if they are not based on genuine economic development.It is true that over recent years our Governments have made remarkable efforts and have begun enormous reform programmes to bring us out of our present difficulties and pursue our growth. Unfortunately  the results have not met our expectations and our situation continues dangerously to become worse.The reasons are simple. We live in a hostile economic climate  because of the selfishness of the developed countries  with their increased protectionism  and the mentality of those whose only motivation is easy profits and who  to their shame  are becoming richer simply through speculation. Those people are playing with the fruits of the labour of our courageous peoples  to whose fate they are totally indifferent.Such speculation deprives us of important resources needed to finance our development  to meet our external commitments aid to make available to our young people  in this computer age  training in the citadels of knowledge  science  technical skills and the technology that will allow us successfully to meet the great challenge of underdevelopment and contributing to bringing about a new international economic order that is more just and equitable.Cote d'lvoire has made great strides along the path of development  through its own efforts and with the valuable help of friendly countries and international financial and monetary organizations. It has also been helped in this by the climate of peace and the resulting political stability. But that development is handicapped today by the drastic losses we are suffering in the export of our main agricultural products  as a result of speculation.In what follows we are not telling anybody anything new. That is especially true of those present who are familiar with the problem or who are also suffering from it. But it is good to put the matter in perspective by revealing that in three years our country lost nearly $9 billion on its products. Over the same period it paid out more than 36 billion to reschedule its external debt  whose repayment it has had to suspend. That was not because we would not pay  but because we could not.When one thinks of the enormous profits reaped in the developed countries on products such as coffee and cocoa  one is entitled to ask what kind of peace with justice we are seeking to bring about in the world.The agonizing debt problem  which has been the subject of a number of international meetings  has again occupied an important place in this debate. It has done so for the simple reason that we must find a solution giving hope of dispelling the uncertainties hanging over the future of the countries particularly affected.We consider that the debt results from the inequality in international trade; the reason is essentially to be found at that level.We fully support the technical solutions suggested in the various proposals  initiatives or plans put forward recently as a result of efforts to think about this thorny problem and find realistic  satisfactory solutions  such as the outright cancellation of some of the debts  a lightening  rescheduling or partial reduction of others and of their servicing and the granting of separate supplementary facilities to provide financial aid on concessionary terms to developing countries  particularly medium-income African countries. We pay tribute to the developed countries that have already taken steps in that regard by deciding to cancel or reduce the debts owed them certain developing countries.However  we believe that proper importance should be attached to the question of fair payment for raw materials. Is it possible to conceive of a global strategy that fails to ensure just remuneration for those materials and to guarantee the stabilization of the export earnings from them  in order to resolve the debt problem? The North-South dialogue  which we all hope will be resumed in order tointroduce ethics into international trade  should consider that question  which is vital for some of us.The idea of lasting development  which is defined in the Brundtland report  is to foster harmony between man aid his environment. It therefore assumes that concerns about a good environment will be integrated within the development process. That is imperative for both rich aid poor countries  for development cannot be carried out at the cost of the degradation of the environment and the destruction of ecological balances. Therefore  the protection of the environment and any development strategy must be interrelated in such a way as to meet the needs of the present without jeopardizing future generations.The United Nations conference on environment and development  to be held in 1992  will give an opportunity for in-depth debate on the question aid for us all to become aware of our national and collective responsibilities with regard to the environment. It was in that spirit that Cote d'lvoire took part at the highest level in March 1989 in the conference on the environment held at The Hague  and signed the Declaration that was adopted.Drug trafficking  yet another scourge today crossing all borders and threatening the future of our youth  requires an international strategy to fight it  a strategy such as that defined in the Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  concluded in Vienna on 20 December 1988 and submitted to States for ratification. The real fight against drugs must not be confined to increased action against traffickers end users* it also requires incentives to producers to devote themselves more to the production of legal  healthy cash crops  yielding enough profit for them to give up the growing of deadly herbs and plants.I could not end this statement without recalling the important united Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) International Congress on Peace in the Minds of Men  held from 26 June to 1 July this year in Yamoussoukro  capital of Cote d'lvoire  on the happy initiative of Mr. Federico Mayor Zaragoza  the Director General of UNESCO. The preamble to UNESCO's constitution states:""since wars begin in the minds of men  it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed"".Personalities of diverse backgrounds  training and faith met in Cote d'lvoire to consider the matter together and propose programmes of action to attain the noble goal of contributing to the search for peace and its defence  to define its outlines and the necessary conditions for it aid to make the international community aware that peace is mankind's most precious possession and that all man's activities must be devoted to preserving it at all costs. The Yamoussoukro Declaration  the fruit of their reflection  embodied aid articulated their faith in a promising future for mankind  a future that we must build patiently within a new and all-encompassing vision of peace  by adopting  at the level of each of us  of our Governments and of our respective peoples  a behaviour which would effectively ensure peace in the world through the triumph of freedom over oppression  of justice over inequity  of solidarity over egoism  of respect for human rights  above all the right to live  over the disregard of such rights  of shared good fortune over regionalized poverty  in brief  full material and spiritual realization for people in a sound environment  with people thus freed at last from the uncertainties of tomorrow.Cote d'lvoire intends  for its part  to strive tirelessly for that peaces peace in the hearts and minds of all people."
"28",1389,"CMR",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  your country  Nigeria  shares a large number of common interests and affinities with Cameroon  which need no emphasizing now. Your presence in the President's seat at this late hour is clear evidence of the links between and the shared concerns of our two countries and peoples. Your personal interest in the problems of our continent  Africa  is shown by your dynamic action as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid.On behalf of Cameroon  I should like to congratulate you most warmly on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your qualities and experience guarantee the success of the work of this session. I should like to take this opportunity to assure you of the constant co-operation of the Cameroon delegation.I should also like to pay a tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  who  throughout his term of office  so skilfully discharged his responsibilities.I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Javier Perez de Cuellar. We should like again to state our confidence in him and our support for his tireless and effective efforts on behalf of peace and international co-operation.Our time is one of interdependence and solidarity  which are so indispensable between nations  regions and peoples. The common destiny of mankind in the face of the many dangers threatening all countries  large or small  rich or poor  has become an inescapable reality of our time. Also inescapable are the fundamental aspirations of all nations and peoples concerning their own welfare. Thanks to the tremendous progress of science and technology  particularly communications  our planet has become a global village  as will the whole human community. We must therefore learn without delay the lessons of this common destiny of mankind. The reduction of tension throughout the world in the search for solutions to the various local conflicts in various regions are all factors which can create an international environment that is stable and secure and that favours economic and social development. That is why bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament  security and development  must be stepped up  as must be efforts to extinguish the various existing hot-beds of tension. In this regard  we continue to encourage the new climate of dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States. We hope to see this climate  which has already produced appreciable results  become even more marked in the interests of those two great nations and the world at large. We welcome the undertaking of the two super-Powers to continue to report to the international community  and particularly to the Conference on Disarmament  on the progress and results of their bilateral negotiations.We note with satisfaction the willingness of all States to intensify their negotiations on the crucial questions of disarmament  particularly nuclear disarmament. In this regard  the holding  in Paris this January  of the International Conference on the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological weapons and recent progress in the Conference on Disarmament on work on an international convention on this important question are encouraging elements in the process of disarmament  which Cameroon fully supports. This optimism is confirmed by the proposals made recently from this rostrum by the President of the United States and by the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union.As representatives are aware  over the last few years my country has submitted a number of proposals on strengthening the role of the United Nations in the disarmament field  on rationalization of the work of the First Committee  and on consolidation of regional peace and security in Africa. We are encouraged by the Assembly's attentive reception of these proposals. We hope that they will contribute to concrete  action-oriented decisions.In this context  we want to stress the decisive and fundamental role played by United Nations peace-keeping forces in the process of the settlement of various conflicts throughout the world  which earned them the Nobel Peace Prize last year. Indeed  the implementation and management of peace-keeping operations are among the central activities of this Organization. It is important  therefore  for Member States to provide the Secretary-General with the necessary administrative machinery for the centralization and following up of all questions relating to military forces and observer groups deployed by the Organization.That is why my country proposes the creation  within the Secretariat  of an integrated administrative structure for the co-ordination and effective carrying out of the various missions and operations decided upon by the Security Council for the maintenance of peace. This is the appropriate place to express our satisfaction at the consensus that has emerged as to the need to strengthen the role of the United Nations and international negotiating machinery. The establishment of international dialogue  which is an essential element in the universal search for peace  has made it possible to take dynamic and concrete initiatives to facilitate the settlement of many regional problems.In southern Africa  the process of Namibian independence  which was launched on 1 April 1989 by the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  is now under way. It is the duty of the United Nations to work tirelessly for the success of this process. We must make it impossible for South Africa - which has accustomed us to trickery  bad faith and all kinds of subterfuges - to interfere with the functioning or distort the results of this process. At this crucial stage in the history of the Territory  Cameroon  which is a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia  calls upon the international community to render all necessary assistance to the South West Africa People's Organization  which is the legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Above all  we should give thought to the provision of high-quality assistance to the young Namibian nation to enable it to bring about its independence and development in the best possible conditions. Cameroon wishes to announce its readiness to strengthen even further its aid to the Namibian people - to establish  consolidate and develop with that country  when it becomes independent  reciprocal and mutually advantageous co-operation of all kinds.The new peace dynamic launched recently in Angola and in Mozambique  thanks to the efforts of Africa  should be strengthened in order to permit those two countries to preserve their sovereignty and to devote themselves wholly to the economic and social development they need so urgently.In South Africa  the odious system of apartheid persists. The most elementary freedom of movement is denied to the majority black population simply because of their colour. The state of emergency is being stepped up. Nelson Mandela and many other leaders of the anti-apartheid movement are still in prison. Beyond the ostensibly conciliatory attitude that the racist regime authorities have been adopting for some time now  there are no grounds for assuming that Pretoria is ready to abandon its policy of apartheid and its acts of aggression against the front-line States.We should not lose sight of the fact that this situation  which is explosive in the short term  could get out of control and become catastrophic for the world  in view of the nuclear capacity that has been acquired by the racist South African regime  as well as its arrogance and its thirst for power and blind domination. The international community should not hesitate to use the sanctions provided for in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to prevail upon South Africa to co-operate with the United Nations - not to reform the system of apartheid but to eradicate it. We appeal urgently to all those whose complicity of all kinds has hitherto enabled South Africa to defy the international community with impunity to participate actively in dismantling apartheid and bringing about a new era of peace and security in that part of the world.As to the other hot-beds of tension  we must commit ourselves to pragmatic and realistic solutions in accordance with the spirit and principles of our Charter.On Western Sahara  we should spare no effort to make it possible for the initiatives that are under way to yield positive results under the aegis of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).On the conflict between Chad and Libya  we are happy about the observance of the cease-fire  which has now been in force for more than a year  and the willingness of the two parties to continue their dialogue under the auspices of the ad hoc committee of the OAU  of which Cameroon is a member  with a view to normalizing their relations. The recent agreement between Algiers and the two countries is undoubtedly the decisive stage in the peaceful settlement of this dispute. It is our great hope that the terms of this agreement will be put into effect as soon as possible so that a new era of peace and co-operation may be established between these two sister nations of our continent.In the horn of Africa  Ethiopia and Somalia have normalized their relations. Other mediation efforts to achieve peace are under way in the sub region.With regard to the Middle East  we welcome the signs of positive developments and hope that they will soon bring about a restoration of peace in the region. We must gird ourselves to search  together  for peace there. Cameroon  which has excellent relations with both Israel and the Arab States  believes that this peace requires recognition of the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to their own homeland  and also the equally fundamental right of the State of Israel to live in peace within internationally recognized frontiers. The time has come for the international community to take the necessary steps to convene the International Conference on this subject.As to other parts of the world where hot-beds of tension persist  whether in Central America or in Asia  the principles of international law enshrined in our Charter - non-interference in the internal affairs of States; peaceful settlement of disputes; non-use of force in international relations - should be accepted by all as the basis for politically negotiated solutions. In this context  we support the Tela Agreements with a view to the normalization of relations between the countries of Central America. We also hope for continuation of peace negotiations on Cambodia within the framework and in the spirit of the recent international conference in Paris.The world continues to face a grave economic crisis. The relative resumption of growth in the rich countries has not been accompanied by the hoped-for beneficial trickle-down effect in the countries of the third world. Those countries  which are living in the most wretched conditions ever known in this century  as well as conflicts of various kinds  constitute a serious threat to the peace  stability and security of all mankind and warrant our keenest attention. In this regard  the economic and financial situation of Africa has aroused the greatest possible concern.The situation is exacerbated by such factors as the following: the deep structural imbalances that mark the world economy ; trade restrictions and protectionist pressures; deteriorating terms of exchange following the brutal plunge in commodity prices and erratic exchange-rate fluctuations; the intolerable growth of the debt burden; the negative flow of capital; and the lack of political will for the establishment of a just and equitable new international economic order.International economic co-operation as it is understood today is unlikely to promote the true development of our young nations. That certainly constitutes a serious threat to the very foundations of international peace and security. It is therefore urgent to review the machinery of international economic exchange in order to maintain commodity prices at a level that would guarantee fair remuneration to the producers. In that context  we await with considerable interest the first actions by the Common Fund for commodities  which has now become operational.We welcome the international community's search for appropriate solutions to the debt problem. Measures taken by the two recent summits of the Seven  held at Toronto and at Paris  and by some developed countries are positive actions that deserves to be encouraged.We should also encourage and strengthen the possibility of intervention by international development institutions  which should be given fresh impetus. Such action can be effective only in a broader framework of a resumed North-South dialogue and global negotiations making it possible to identify in the relations among the parties various aspects of the world economy with a view to promoting growth and development.In that connection  Cameroon supports the convening next year of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation. If such a session is to succeed  we must first of all learn the lessons of the present decade and ensure that the new development strategy takes advantage of opportunities before it. We must therefore stress the importance of a change in attitude by the principal world economic partners. On both sides  we must avoid ideological squabbling and focus pragmatically on the substantive questions that underlie our poverty and underdevelopment.We also support holding an international conference on African debt  which would enable the parties concerned to find realistic solutions that would break the vicious cycle of indebtedness. We want objective and equitable solutions to that debt that could safeguard the development process in our countries and secure the welfare of our peoples. We need true international solidarity. As the President of the Republic of Cameroon  Mr. Paul Biya  has said ""There can be true solidarity only with the strictest respect for the dignity and freedom of others"".For that reason  we call on all our partners to participate constructively in that international conference  giving expression to the solidarity that must unite all countries and nations. I stress that such a conference could gain impetus in the framework of the United Nations  which has already formulated a Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development.Of course  our continent must be able to count first and foremost on itself. It is therefore determined to give fresh impetus to agricultural development  to make more rational use of its human resources  to improve the management of the economy through restructuring  and to strengthen co-operation within regional and sub-regional organizations. Africa now expects the international community to show the extra political will by supporting its own efforts through the adoption of concrete measures both bilaterally and in the framework of international economic  financial and monetary institutions. It is our difficult but lofty duty to preserve mankind and create a world of peace and prosperity. In that context  questions of the environment and human rights are of paramount importance. We welcome the 1992 convening of a United Nations conference on environment and development. The recent dangerous damage to the ozone layer  natural disasters  drought  desertification  the dumping of toxic waste in Africa and other parts of the world and many other ecological disasters point to the urgency of convening such a conference. We must work to reconcile the protection of the environment with the imperatives of growth for the developing countries. At stake is the very survival of mankind.It has become the custom to speak much of human rights questions while stressing their civil and political aspects. Cameroon feels that human rights should be understood in their most complete and comprehensive sense  including economic  social and cultural rights and  above all  the right to development. We feel too that greater importance should be attached to the protection of the child  whose rights to health  nutrition and education do not always get the priority attention they deserve. Cameroon warmly supports initiatives by the United Nations Children's Fund with respect to the declaration of a decade for the African child  the organization of a world summit on the child  and the formulation of a convention on the rights of the child. We hope the international community will give those initiatives the support they deserve.We are here because we have faith in the ability of multilateralism to find global solutions to the problems of our day. We reaffirm that peace  disarmament and development are goals that can be reached.Harsh economic conditions and the evils they spawn - poverty  misery  political instability and lack of security - are inextricably bound together. Recognition of those bonds gives all political leaders a new imperative reason to consider and work to improve everyone's access to well-being. Political wisdom dictates the search for a more stable  just and equitable new international order. It calls on us to work for a global  common search for viable solutions to the many problems arising from the extreme poverty in which three quarters of mankind lives  world stability must be our first concern in the search for the well-being of nations and the advent of a better world.Such a world means the reversal of harmful trends that have long marked international relations. Above all  it means that all States must renew their faith and their commitment to the ideals  purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  which must truly guide the main trends of relations among States. In that context  the Organization must be able to play a larger  more active role in promoting international peace  security and co-operation. Its principal organs - the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council and the Office of the Secretary-General - should be strengthened and revitalized in order to increase their effectiveness and promote more democratic international relations.We must give full support to the Secretary-General in that endeavour. We must not follow standard practice in asking too much of the Organization without giving it in return what it needs to play an effective role in regulating our higher common interests  of which peace  international security and co-operation are the decisive elements. We can do this only if  as States and regions  we display firm determination to promote policies leading to an international climate fostering trust among States  peace  the elimination of conflicts  disarmament and the promotion of justice and equity. Within this process the major Powers  most of which are founding Members of this Organization and which have special responsibilities under the Charter  should set an example. It is up to them particularly to play a major role in accordance with the spirit of the Charter of San Francisco.At this time of profound change we welcome the dynamic action taken by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which  as always  has made a major contribution to the positive development of international relations. At its recent ninth summit Conference  in Belgrade  our Movement once again presented to the world its ideas  priorities and vision  which  in the final analysis  sum up the aspirations of the whole of mankind to a safer  more just and equitable world.The realism  wisdom and relevance of the consensus reflected in the final Declaration adopted at that summit Conference is eloquent testimony to the movement of this group in the right direction  and we should welcome that. This is a sign of the modernization  maturity and growing credibility of the non-aligned countries. All the questions of the hour that are crucial for the future of mankind now have a world-wide dimension. That is why my country  Cameroon  remains convinced that the United Nations remains the best place for activating the various negotiations designed to make significant progress towards a new order. In the final analysis the United Nations constitutes an irreplaceable centre for harmonizing the positions of nations in order to preserve future generations from the scourge of war and to leave them a better and better world."
"29",1431,"COD",44,1989,"ï»¿: On 4 October 1973 - in other words  16 years ago to the day - I addressed the General Assembly for the first time. Since then  many of the situations that were dealt with at that time have undergone profound change. As I take the floor for the second time from this rostrum  my very first words will be to tell you how very glad I am to be able to share with you my reflections on some of the contemporary problems that will shape the future of humankind. Let me first  Mr. President  congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am gratified indeed at the confidence and the honour that all the States members of our Organization have accorded  not only to your person and your country  but indeed to Africa  which is legitimately proud of this. I also congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  the head of the Argentine delegation  for the masterful way he presided over the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I wish to pay a special tribute also to the Secretary-General of the united Nations  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose competence and skill have enabled our Organization to regain its credibility. Therein lies proof of the fact that the countries of the southern hemisphere are proving their ability to contribute effectively to the taking of decisions that guide the affairs of the world.The Republic of Zaire will always recall the important role played  immediately after its independence  by the United Nations in restoring peace and safeguarding our national unity  jeopardized by the spectre of internationalisation of the Congo crisis  which we remember as a tragic event.In exactly 11 years  the lights will dim and go out on the twentieth century. This is something more than the simple passage from one century to another? it is the crossing of a threshold between two millennia - a rare phenomenon in the life of any person. To have the illusion of having gone through a thousand years is a privilege not given to all generations.But  if the ways in which God moves are mysterious and if no one knows what the years ahead hold in store for us  one thing none the less remains certain: a few nations around the world  representing 683 million inhabitants out of the 6 billion of the total population  are jealously monopolizing the technology  progress and development to whose expansion all peoples the world over have made a contribution. This is why the message I carry to this Assembly from the heart of Africa is first and foremost a message of peace and an appeal for the solidarity of peoples  together with an invitation to safeguard our environment  so that the twenty-first century  the horizon of which we are now trying to scan  may become for us a century of progress and of shared happiness.But first and foremost  I crave your indulgence as I return briefly to the consideration of certain subjects that I broached some 16 years ago  notably those involving peace and the international economic order. You will recall that  backthen  I denounced the perpetuation of the colonial situation and of apartheid on African soil  and I recalled that before the hurricane of history  ready or not  ripe or not  a fruit will fall.Thus  we have seen the Portuguese compelled to abandon their African colonies and the British turn over the reins of power to the black majority in the former Southern Rhodesia. Apartheid continues to flout the conscience of all mankind  but Africa and the world have managed in the meantime to mobilize with a view to dismantling it  and the time is not far off when blacks  whites  mestizos and Indians will be able to enjoy the same rights and the same freedoms within one and the same democratic State.On the strength of that conviction  and notwithstanding the predictable reactions that certain initiatives would give rise to  I agreed to receive in my own country  first  former President Pieter Botha  in October 1988  and then  last August  his successor  Frederik de Klerk. Those two encounters enabled me to make an appeal before my interlocutors for the cause of those whose freedom and dignity are flouted and to stress the urgency of doing away with apartheid. Beyond that  the ad Hoc Committee on Apartheid of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) displayed open-mindedness and good will in acknowledging recently  at Harare  and under certain conditions  the principle of constructive dialogue with the Pretoria regime.As regards Namibia  the last colonial bastion on the African continent  it is resolutely moving towards independence thanks to the determination of the nationalists of Namibia  led by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and thanks to tine relentless pressure brought to bear by the international community on South Africa. The Assembly will recall that  as a way of bearing witness to its solidarity with Egypt  a part of whose territory was occupied by Israel  the Republic of Zaire  represented by myself personally  announced from this lofty rostrum that it was breaking diplomatic relations with the Hebrew State. The restitution of the Sinai to Egypt having occurred in the interim  in 1982  in conformity with the Camp David Accords  it made seize for us properly to restore our diplomatic relations with Tel Aviv.What this means is that this position makes it possible for the Republic of Zaire to remind our Israeli friends that if they feel entitled to have secure and recognized boundaries they must in exchange recognize the same rights for the Palestinians reduced to wandering for more than 40 years. Now Palestinians and Israelis can no longer ignore one mother. They must sit down together arid make peace on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967).Since then  on the Asian continent Viet Nam has managed to achieve its own unification? the Korean people is pursuing the path of dialogue to decide on its destiny  while the Cambodian people has placed its hope in the dialogue  difficult to be sure  that has begun among its various leaders in Paris? the breakdown of the first round must not discourage us.In the space of 16 years many other hotbeds of tension have sprung up across Africa: Chad  Western Sahara  Ethiopia  Somalia  Sudan  Angola  Mozambique  Burundi  Burkina Faso  Mali and  more recently  Senegal and Mauritania.Our continent needs no armed conflict. It is peace and development to which it deeply aspires. That is why we welcome the fact that  thanks to the advantages of dialogue and the concerted approach to things  certain of these hotbeds of tension have been defused while others are in the process of being defused  which further testifies to the maturity of Africans and their ability to settle their disputes peacefully.Further away from ourselves  speaking in this case about the Afghan problem  we encourage the unilateral or concerted initiatives already in train. In so far as the Iran-Iraq conflict is concerned  we welcome the cease-fire that has come about  and in this connection we praise the discreet and effective steps taken by the Secretary-General.Likewise we hope that Lebanon  once freed from foreign influence  will again find the path to national reconciliation and build upon its rich tradition as a people that is industrious and loves peace and freedom. Along these lines we support the work the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League has been doing.In connection with international economic relations between poor and rich countries alike  when I first addressed the Assembly I asked the conscience of the world to ask itself in turn whether it was not the poor countries which in the final analysis served to enrich the wealthy ones.Today I feel that the answer is clear. No one  indeed  can have any doubt about the reality of the phenomenon of negative capital transfers to the detriment of the poor countries through  among other things  machinery set up for the repayment of debt. We are also concerned about protecting the environment} the Republic of Zaire had the honour to initiate the World Charter for Nature. That has not  however  kept certain industrialized countries from unscrupulously transforming Africa into a dumping ground for toxic wastes described on our continent as deadly waste. This brief retrospective indicates that over the course of the last 16 years  notwithstanding the cropping up of certain hotbeds of tension  tine international climate has improved significantly. However  there is the risk of all this being compromised as long as certain crucial problems continue to jeopardize world equilibrium. He are here speaking about issues of development  peace and the environment. In our day and age  mankind has the resources and wherewithal to ensure its development world-wide  but a number of countries  particularly those of Africa  lag behind considerably in economic and social terms  notwithstanding their enormous potential in natural resources.Two major phenomena  closely linked  stymie all efforts at growth and development of our economies the crushing burden of external debt and the relentless worsening of terms of trade. These phenomena are familiar to all of us  and I would stress above all the question of our external debt.So far as we Africans are concerned  external debt is strangling our economies. By contrast  so far as our creditors are concerned  the $230 billion Africa owes them is scarcely a drop in the bucket compared to what the New York Stock Exchange alone lost in the October 1987 financial crash.In Zaire  for instance  before the 1987 restructuring  debt servicing was devouring some 26 per cent of our export income and some 50 per cent of the State budget. It was no longer possible to finance social expenditures even at a minimal level or to make indispensable investments in infrastructure.Notwithstanding the restructuring  indebtedness continues to grow because of the machinery of accumulative interest  compelling us to resort to still more borrowing.None the less we appreciate the gestures of solidarity made before the Toronto Summit by Canada  and after it by France  the United States and a number of other developed countries.Recently Belgium  in turn  took an innovative approach to the matter  not only by cancelling public debts involving Africa* countries and absorbing a third of the commercial debt guaranteed notably vis-Ã -vis Zaire  but also by staggering and restructuring two thirds of that commercial debt over a period of 25 years with a 14-year period of grace.Moreover  interest charges on the two remaining thirds will be converted into a fund based on local currency aimed at financing development projects initiated by the beneficiary countries. Still addressing the subject of debt  I pay tribute also to the People's Republic of China  which since 1973 has discreetly  for the benefit of its African partners including Zaire  enacted measures consisting in a lightening of the debt burden by converting credits into local currencies for the purpose of financing on-the-scene bilateral co-operation projects.These isolated measures aimed at lightening the debt burden are generous to be sure  but they will not be as great as desired because of the harmful effect of the deterioration in the terms of trade on our economies  which will reduce our capacity to repay debt and to finance our development.We feel that the African continent must be able to enter the next century with dignity. Innovative international policies must be devised to reduce foreign debt  restore confidence among partners and strengthen co-operation for development. This is a question of ethics and justice. What we have always asked of our partners - without failing to acknowledge the need to repay debt - especially in the case of the least developed countries  is that moratoriums be arranged  that repayment be extended over more realistic periods  and that interest rates be renegotiated  taking into account our actual ability to pay.However  now that the last decade of the twentieth century is at hand  is it not time to come up with more innovative solutions to the debt problem? Guided by the model of co-operation already set up by some Member States  the international community should urge Africa's creditors to accept the principle of a grace period of at least 10 years and to agree to the repayment of all debt in local currencies. The resources thereby freed would be channelled into national development funds  which would in turn be earmarked for financing public aid private investment projects likely to further the growth of our economies.In so doing  our creditors - that is  States  commercial banks and multinational corporations - instead of passively awaiting repayment of their debts  would participate on a basis of solidarity in restoring growth to our economies. Thus  and only thus  will it be possible to preserve and strengthen the climate of detente aid mutual trust in international relations between the wealthy countries and our developing countries.I take this opportunity to recall that the united Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  which was adapted at the conclusion of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to that question  included two complementary obligations. First  the African countries have the obligation to implement economic reforms and  secondly  the international community undertakes the commitment to support Africa's efforts. Some time prior to the adoption of that Programme a number of African countries  including the Republic of Zaire  had begin economic-policy reforms designed to foster rapid recovery and to lay the groundwork for sustained development. That determination is all the more courageous and praiseworthy in that the effects of those measures have generally spawned social tension and political instability.Notwithstanding the sacrifices made  the results of those structural adjustment measures have proved meagre  ephemeral or merely nonexistent. Indeed  our situation has grown worse  as was confirmed by the Secretary-General's report - submitted to the forty-third session of the General Assembly - on the mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme.For those reasons I make this appeal to the conscience of the international community* beginning in 1990  and in the light of the approach I have just sketched out  let us devise a genuine plan for international solidarity in favour of African development  a plan similar to the Marshall Plan that was launched for the reconstruction of a Europe ravaged and devastated by the Second world war.It is within that framework that I am proposing that in the decade 1990 to 1999 the African countries pay all their debts in local currency and that the new recourses thus freed be devoted solely to attaining the goal of economic growth with the co-operation of the competent international organs.Taking advantage of reforms already under way  the lessons learned from past experience  and the effects of recent actions  Africa will be sufficiently prepared to cope with domestic constraints  to participate actively as a genuine economic partner in the progress and development of mankind  and thus to occupy an honourable place in the world of the twenty-first century.However  African economic development presupposes a climate of peace  freedom and security. Africa feels that it is an integral part of any process designed to achieve world peace. Thus  each State of our continent  to the extent of its possibilities  feels the duty to work towards the maintenance of peace  both home and abroad.In this connection I have noted with satisfaction - as has for that matter the international community as a whole - the progress achieved in recent years in the field of disarmament and the reduction of armed conflicts  particularly through the promotion of the detente set in train by the Washington agreements concluded between the united States of America and the Soviet Union.However  that climate  which is basically a product of the lessening of tension between the two super-Powers  must also generate the results the international community expects in the field of development. As the Assembly is aware  from the moment it attained independence my country  Zaire  has been obliged to overcome civil wars and wars of secession  from the ashes of which a State and a nation have been forged. For almost 24 years the people of Zaire have been living in peace and national harmony. Moved by its commitment to Africa in the service of peace  the Republic of Zaire has  together with its neighbours Rwanda and Burundi  established a zone of economic solidarity that has rapidly become a zone of security and stability in the sub-continent.In the name of maintaining peace  my country has twice lent its support to Chad  first at the request of the Organization of African Unity and then in response to the appeal of the legal Government of Chad  in order to defend that country's territorial integrity. Tirelessly pursuing the ideal of peace  the Republic of Zaire and Zambia  its neighbour to the south-east  have  after seven years of negotiations  just signed a treaty delimiting a portion of their common frontier that had been undefined and a source of contention since 1894.Of the 9 116 kilometres of border it shares with nine neighbouring States  Zaire shares more than 2 600 kilometres with Angola. That indicates our interest in seeing peace restored to that fraternal country that has been ravaged by 14 years of war. That is why I unhesitatingly agreed to undertake the mission of mediation entrusted to me by my colleagues the Heads of State of central and southern Africa  who met on 16 May this year at Luanda. Within that context managed - not without difficulty - to organize on 22 June 1989 the Gbadolite summit meeting in which 20 African countries participated  including 18 Heads of State and two highly placed heads of delegation.that day Africa witnessed the laying of the foundation on which peace in Angola will be built  namely  the historic handshake between President Dos Santos of Angola and Mr. Jonas Savimbi  the leader of UN IT A; the proclamation of a cease-fire? and the establishment of the principle of negotiations leading to national reconciliation.For my part  I believe that the Angolans remain the sole masters of the peace process that has been initiated. In whatever way they work together  directly or indirectly  it is up to the Angolans alone to deal with the political and military questions that affect their coin try.The international community has noted that if respect for the cease-fire under the Gbadolite Declaration has proved to be ephemeral  for essentially psychological reasons compounded by interference from abroad  our Angolan brothers none the less have not broken off dialogue but indeed have gathered four successive times with the mediator.I remain convinced that the unshakable determination to restore peace clearly expressed by the Angolan people will prove more than equal to current difficulties. The full implementation of the Brazzaville and New York quadripartite accords and the successful implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia  together with the advent of peace and justice in southern Africa  depend in great part on national reconciliation in Angola. I invite the international community to do all it can to ensure that the efforts of Africa and of Angola towards peace are crowned with success. In our capacity as mediator we remain more than ever determined to provide our Angolan brothers with all possible assistance and to make available to them our own modest experience.Peace  security and economic and social development call for the advent of an environment in which people can freely develop and evolve in tranquillity  with their rights fully guaranteed. In Africa we are familiar with the prominence accorded to fundamental freedoms ever since the era of traditional societies  vestiges of which still survive today notwithstanding the determination of the colonial Powers to annihilate them. Our ancestors were devoted to the idea of freedom in the name of which they fiercely resisted everywhere all attempts at conquest from outside.The question new for us Africans is to ascertain whether the political structures we are setting up do indeed foster the full unfolding of freedom. This is not because that is what the West wants us to do - because democracy is not themonopoly of Western societies - but because we continually seek political and economic strategies likely to promote out development.TO be sure  we do not maintain that modern African societies no longer have anything to accomplish for democracy or for more democracy. On the contrary  we are saying that some of our political structures constitute a real democratic framework attuned to the African and likely to achieve social integration in our countries.In Zaire we are endeavouring to bring our own particular touches to bear on formulating and avoiding human rights. It is with this concern in mind that we have adhered to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ratified the two international Covenants on civil aid political rights aid on economic and social rights. My country is one of the 40 States Members of the Organization to have ratified the Optional Protocol on Civil and Political Rights. It also immediately acceded to the African Human Rights Charter. Finally  my Government includes a department entrusted with the protection of the rights and freedoms of our citizens  a department endowed with sweeping powers to accomplish its mission. The machinery thus set up illustrates our political determination to promote the rights and freedoms of Zairian citizens and the rights of foreigners who have chosen to live within our country.Experience  though recent  has already shown that this department is playing an essential role in providing information to citizens on their rights and freedoms; it is intervening and redressing acts involving damage done when individuals have seen their rights unjustly violated and have exhausted all other machinery of recourse? and it oversees respect for procedures  conditions and proper treatment with regard to detainees.Zaire welcomes the tribute paid to it by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in February this year in omitting its name  on the basis of what had been achieved in this field  from the list of countries considered as not respecting human rights. Of course  we recognize that we have not yet reached the ideal situation  but the fact that all countries of the world  even the most advanced  do not escape criticism when it comes to the violation of individual rights adequately shows that one cannot  on the basis of an administrative or police slip-up noted here or there  confuse a State of law with States that have made repression their system of government.I should like to conclude my statement by dealing with questions involving the environment. I recall with emotion my own youth closely intertwined with the majesty of our rivers and the purity of our streams. I also recall our virgin and luxuriant forests from which every morning one heard the call of birds. It is with deep sadness that we witness today the accelerated deterioration of our natural environment under the impact of multiple and repeated aggression. The indignation and protest triggered the world over by the export of toxic wastes have shown a growing awareness within the international community of the major risks for humanity posed by the deterioration of the quality of life  of which atmospheric pollution is one of the most obvious manifestations. Hence  Zaire urgently calls for the swift devising of rigorous international norms vital to the preservation of our planet and the future of mankind.At the present stage  my country's contribution towards safeguarding the natural environment is expressed by its active support for the complete implementation of the World Charter for Nature.With 47 per cant of the tropical African forests within its borders the Republic of Zaire has brought 5 per cent of its national territory under national protection. Our goal is to bring that figure up to 16 per cent - some 376 200 square kilometres. Within this area we arc protecting rare species threatened by extinction. This includes the white rhinoceros  the number of which increased from 11 in 1980 to 25 in 1989. We are also ensuring the protection of the okapis a partial study over 10 000 square kilometres has show a density of okapi for every two square kilometres. As for elephants  the forests and savannahs of Zaire contain a population of nearly 200 000 elephants out of a total of 700 000 across all of Africa. Here  I pay tribute to all those countries that have taken measures aimed at discouraging trade in ivory  the major cause of the extermination of elephants. Our concern also goes to gorillas living in the mountains we share with our neighbour  Rwanda  aid for which the late regretted but remembered Mrs. Ebssey gave her life. members will agree with me that all progress that compromises ecological balance destroys man himself as he seeks to achieve peace and a life of tranquillity and full development. I should like to conclude by expressing the hope that the climate of detente which marks international relations today will become much stronger and  in the last decade of the twentieth century  bring us more peace aid more solidarity among peoples.It seems to me to be vital that the international community adopt a disinterested approach of genuine solidarity towards Africa  with regard to which many prejudices are held  tending to condemn us to underdevelopment.Therefore  with regard to Africa's indebtedness  I have proposed a new approach  that of converting all our debts into local currency and setting up development funds to finance priority investments. That would mean creating the conditions to enable Africa to take charge of its own development and to enter the twenty-first century with greater dignity.It goes without saying that  as I have already pointed out  for Africa world peace is essential. That is why I have emphasized my country's contribution to the efforts to restore peace in Africa  and especially in Angola.Similarly  it must be recognized that human rights and freedoms are among the preconditions for the development of any human community. As regards ourselves  I have described the institutional machinery that we have devised and established to promote and protect those rights and freedoms.Finally  I have recalled the international community's duty with regard to nature  whose preservation is indispensable for the survival of the human race  and I have described Zaire's contribution in that regard.The principles on which our Organization is based and to which we have all freely subscribed are noble. They reflect our common concern for peace aid freedom and for the dignity and improved well-being of all the peoples of the world. Respect for those objects of our concern is the best guarantee of a serene future for mankind.May the twenty-first century fulfil our hopes of solidarity  justice  peace and progress."
"30",1477,"COG",44,1989,"ï»¿The year that is now drawing to its end has demonstrated the perfectible nature of international life. In a good number of situations which until very recently appeared to be insoluble there have been positive developments. The Congo welcomes this wind of change that has been blowing throughout the world for some time now  fostering dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union. It is a wind that has blown away traditional perceptions of world politics and has created new prospects for peace and co-operation.However  we are bound to acknowledge that these favourable developments at the political level have not yet had the desired effects in the area of development issues. I am thinking in particular of issues associated with the international economic situation  protection of the environment  and drug trafficking. Despite the persistence of these problems  allow me to associate the People's Republic of the Congo with the hopes that have been expressed by other representatives who share with us the aspiration to a world dedicated to peace  freedom and justice.I take pleasure in offering to you  Sir  my heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your election is a token of the tribute that the international community wishes to pay to Nigeria - a country with which the People's Republic of the Congo has excellent relations of friendship  brotherhood and co-operation  and whose traditions of openness and co-operation derive from its natural readiness to stand side by side with the United Nations whenever the situation demands it. Allow roe to congratulate also Mr. Dante Caputo  your predecessor as President  whose effective and skilful guidance of the work of the General Assembly at its forty-third session won him the respect of the whole Assembly. Our heartfelt thanks go to him. I want also to express my country's gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar -.a great man dedicated to the cause of peace  who  despite short-term difficulties  is carrying out his task courageously and resolutely.The United Nations - crucible of the nations  the ideal forum for championing just causes  an Organization whose legitimate aim is to serve individuals and States - feels intensely all the turmoil affecting the international community. This should urge the Member States to support its efforts in seeking solutions to the vital problems facing mankind. The crises and conflicts that beset the world justify us in constantly seeking balance  security and peace  and justify our aspiration to a fairer and more equitable order - a vital prerequisite for the creation of an ideal climate of active solidarity  which de in aids tolerance  the right to be different  justice and mutual acceptance  as well as progress shared by all. That is why we believe that it is imperative that the United Nations be given the operational means and the capacity that it needs to ensure the maintenance of peace among nations.Consequently  we welcome the fact that the crisis in multilateralism  which was so dreaded a few years ago  has given way to the rebirth of multilateral diplomacy. We hope that this new awareness will continue to inspire us aid will enable the Organization to win the battles that it must fight and to tackle the numerous challenges before it.Disarmament is a matter of concern to all of us. In view of the danger inherent in nuclear weaponry  the signing  in December 1987  of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  and its implementation  are of great historic significance for the strengthening of peace in the world. We hope that the 50 per cent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons will become a reality. All countries that possess nuclear weapons should participate in this disarmament process.Similarly  my country wishes to express its support for the initiative taken by some Members of this Organization in calling for the convening of a conference of States parties to the partial test-ban Treaty to consider amendments designed to convert that Treaty into a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban Treaty. My delegation welcomes with satisfaction the statements made here a few days ago by President Bush and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Onion  Mr. Shevardnadze  on the banning of chemical weapons  endorsing the conclusions of the Paris Conference held in January 1989  at which 149 countries  among them Congo  gave their solemn undertaking not to use chemical weapons.We have seen appalling pictures in the media showing the use of such weapons in recent conflicts. This is surely an opportunity to urge the participants in the Conference in Geneva to bring the negotiations to a conclusion as soon as possible  with a view to concluding a multilateral convention on the prohibition of the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.The climate of detente aid the beginning of constructive dialogue which we can see at the present time offer grounds for optimism. My country is dedicated to peace  justice  national concord and democracy  as evidenced by the conclusions reached at the last congress of our party and the results of the legislative elections of 24 September 1989. Thus  my country can only welcome the prospects for peace which are perceptible in various parts of the world where tensions were brewing.In Central America and the Caribbean  we welcome the results of the tireless efforts of the Heads of State and Government of the sub region since Esquipulas II  which recently yielded fruit in the form of the Tela Declaration of 7 August 1989. This development requires all other States to refrain from any action which might place an obstacle in the way of this process. We follow with particular interest the process of democratisation which is now under way there and which the international community should support. In South-East Asia  a number of initiatives have been taken this year which indicate a decisive and significant turning-point in political terms. The policy of national reconciliation which has been la inched in Kampuchea should be pursued. The opening of peace negotiations in the form of the Jakarta and Paris meetings represent an undertaking which must be welcomed aid encouraged.In Afghanistan  thanks to the efforts of the Secretary-General and the parties concerned  an important step forward has been taken with the signing of the Geneva Agreements on 14 April 1988. In the absence of any effective cease-fire and given the resurgence of fighting  my country wishes to reaffirm its adherence to the Geneva Agreements as the sole acceptable basis for a settlement to that conflict.In the Korean peninsula  we note with satisfaction the efforts being made to bring about a rapprochement between the North and the South  which is a necessary prelude to the peaceful reunification of Korea.With respect to Iran and Iraq  the peace negotiations on which those two countries have embarked are a sign of hope which we should all work to strengthen. The People's Republic of the Congo supports the continued peace talks aimed at the total implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) aid hopes that the related problems will not obstruct the peace efforts undertaken by the international community.With respect to the question of Cyprus  my country welcomes the willingness of the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities  thanks to the good offices of the Secretary-General  to undertake to work tirelessly together with a view to concluding a comprehensive agreement to safeguard peace and national unity in that country.In North Africa  the contacts which have begun between the Moroccan Government and the POLISARIO Front augur well for an era of peace and stability in that region. The referendum provided for in the various relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity aid the United Nations will enable the basic question of self-determination for the Saharoui people to be settled. The efforts of the Secretary-General  who has been working tirelessly to that end  deserve the encouragement of my country and of the whole international community. We hope that the dialogue that has begun will continue in more favourable conditions.Along these same lines  my country also lends its support to the efforts to achieve peace in the Horn of Africa  particularly in Ethiopia aid the Sudan.The framework agreement signed between Libya and Chad on 7 September last in Algiers  designed to settle the dispute between those two countries  is  as far as my delegations is concerned  the ideal way to work towards a final settlement of that conflict. We continue to be convinced that  from this time on  a climate of tranquillity  understanding and good-neighbourliness will prevail in the relations between those two countries.While the situations to which I have referred attest to the climate of detente which is favourable to improvement in international relations  we are bound to recognize that these situations are still precarious  as evidenced by the persistence of hotbeds of tension around the world. In the Middle East  the situation is extremely worrisome. That situation  with the thorny Palestinian problem at its epicentre  is at present at an almost total deadlock. One might have thought that following the concessions made by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on the basis of Security Council resolutions 2 42 (1967) aid 338 (1973)  a new process might have been begun aimed at reopening the peace process and beginning a dialogue between the Israelis and Palestinians. On the contrary  we are witnessing redoubled violence against the Palestinian people. The intifadah  the symbol of the resistance of the Palestinian people to the occupation of its homeland  reflects the determination of that people to build a free and independent nation. Congo  which recognized the State of Palestine proclaimed in Algiers in November last year following the meeting of the Palestine National Council  considers that the restoration of lasting peace requires the liberation of the occupied territories.My country believes that the holding of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations; with the participation of all the parties  including the PLO  is the only appropriate framework for negotiations which will enable the Palestinian people to exercise its right to self-determination and which would guarantee the right of all the States of the region to live within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.It is with deep distress that I must now speak of Lebanon  a name which  only about 15 years ago  was synonymous with joie de vivre aid which is now synonymous with warfare  Neither the Arab League's cease-fire nor the United Nations cease-fire has been able effectively to stop the fighting  this making the mission of the committee of good offices of the Arab League even more difficult  lb the Lebanese people  the victim of external interference  we reaffirm our solidarity and we support the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of Heads of State  which is seeking to restore peace to that people.As members are aware  the situation in southern Africa for my country is one of major concern. As far as it has been possible to do so  the people of Congo  under the leadership of President Denis Sassou Nguesso  is lending its support to the establishment of global end lasting peace in the region. Indeed  having worked for the conclusion of the agreements reached at Brazzaville and New York  President Denis Sassou Nguesso has spared no effort to achieve  in conjunction with other Heads of State  the total and final elimination of all the factors that generate tension and conflict in Angola  in South Africa and in all the other countries of southern Africa. In that connection Congolese observers  under the aegis of the United Nations  are taking part in the implementation of some of those agreements in the field. Congo is actively participating in the process of national reconciliation in Angola and shares the hopes raised at the Gbadolite summit meeting on 22 June 1989. We take this opportunity to appeal to the international community and to all the friends of the Angolan people to support the efforts of the Government  the people and all the sons of Angola to bring about national reconciliation and rebuild that country.Indeed  have five centuries of colonization  33 years of liberation struggle and 14 years of internal conflict not been an unduly heavy price for a people to pay - a people that aspires only to live in peace so it can work for its country's development?With regard to the People's Republic of Mozambique  we are convinced that the policy of national reconciliation initiated by President Joachim Alberto Chissano and FRELIMO will ensure the genuine peace that is so vital for that fraternal country's reconstruction.In Namibia a historic event looms on the horizons the independence of that brother country after long years of heroic struggle by the Namibian people  aided the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  against South Africa's occupation forces. We urge the international community to be vigilant in ensuring the full implementation of Security Council resolution 43 5 (1978) so that all the necessary conditions are met for the holding of free and democratic elections. It is clear that the advent of an independent Namibia on the world scene will require assistance from the international community in keeping with the scale of the challenges the new country must face in consolidating peace and beginning national reconstruction.In basing its existence on the policy of separate racial development  South Africa is maintaining an anachronism unworthy of the modern world. Recent changes that have occurred in the South African leadership  aid the ensuing legislative elections that excluded the black majority  have not basically altered our perception of the nature of that regime. Neither the purportedly reassuring statements of the new Government nor the proposed reforms can alter unshakeable international public opinion  which is determined to abolish apartheid a crime against humanity. Apartheid cannot be reformed) it must be eradicated. What the international community expects from the South African Government is a demonstration of its good faith and its ability to put an end to apartheid in keeping with the desire of the non-aligned countries and the members of the Organization of African Unity (OMJ) as expressed in the Declaration of the ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State on Southern Africa of which my country is a member.Peace and security in South Africa call for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela aid all political prisoners the lifting of the state of emergency  the restoration of all civil rights for all citizens and the establishment of a genuinely democratic regime  as well as the termination of any policy aimed at destabilizing the countries of the sub region.As is obvious  the current situation in South Africa  still far from meeting the requirements of the international community  can only compel us to maintain and intensify our political  economic end financial pressures on the apartheid regime. We venture to hope that national committees in the anti-apartheid struggle and the international community as a whole will increase their activities and lend stronger support to the initiatives of the African Committee against apartheid  of which my country is Chairman  as well as the efforts of the Action for Resisting Invasion  Colonialism and Apartheid (AFRICA) Fund.As we are all aware  today terrorism concerns the entire world because of the large loss of human life it causes. My country  so recently the victim of a terrorist attack  which caused the death of 49 citizens who perished in the attack against a UTA Airline DC-10  condemns terrorism aid urges the international community to wage a pitiless struggle against that evil and to eradicate it.The drug problem has now reached alarming proportions. It has devastating effects on many countries throughout the world. The link that has been established between drugs and crime threatens the very security of States. Africa  long considered free from the problem of drug trafficking  is gradually becoming involved in that repugnant trade.It is therefore vital to strengthen international co-operation and to support the efforts that have recently been begun to eradicate that phenomenon  whose ultimate goal is the disintegration of our States. That was the spirit in which an international seminar on legislation to combat drugs was convened at Brazzaville last April - a seminar that brought together 14 African countries and that agreed on the vital necessity to devise aid harmonize national legislations under the aegis of the United Nations.For nearly two years the relaxation of East-West tensions and the resulting beneficial effects on regional conflicts have given us good reasons to hope that we are entering a new era of dialogue and peace. The new political climate of detente  we hoped  would quite naturally prompt the international community to work to find agreed solutions to the crucial problems of the world economy  which is riddled with uncertainties that cast a threatening shadow on the future of the developing countries. All reports are unanimous in painting a picture of a world economy marked by glaring contrasts. While the industrialized countries continue to enjoy sustained growth most of the developing countries are becoming bogged down in stagnation or even recession.Furthermore  the magnitude of the foreign indebtedness of developing countries which in only 7 years has risen from $800 billion in 1982 to 31 320 billion in 1988  has further worsened their economic and social situations by putting a sudden brake on growth and causing an unprecedented deterioration in the living conditions of their populations. In many cases prolonged austerity programmes have led to violence and generated greater insecurity and unemployment  which most severely affect the broadest and most vulnerable sectors of society.It is true that measures and initiatives have been taken to lighten the debt burden of developing countries. My country welcomes that. But we regret that such measures often exclude countries at the so-called middle-income level  like the Congo  which none the less have the highest ratios of debt. However  given the gravity of the problem those measures have proved insufficient vis-Ã -vis long-term development objectives. They must be backed up by a comprehensive and integrated strategy in a spirit of shared responsibility in the true sense.Debt reduction  which is on the agenda of this body and of other forums  can offer real hope only if it goes hand in hand with substantial support in the form of appropriate financial resources. That support is a vital part of any debt-relief policy  particularly at a time when we note with regret an alarming trend towards a diminution of financial flows  especially characterized by the stagnation of official development assistance and a drying-up of flows of commercial finance  while at the same time  paradoxically  the net transfer of financial resources from developing to developed countries rose to $43 billion in 1988. Furthermore  the continued worsening of the economic and social situation in Africa  exacerbated by the debt crisis  bears out the value and relevance of the common position an African debt adopted in 1987 at the third special summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). That debt  estimated in 1988 at 3230 billion  absorbs a considerable portion of the export earnings of African countries.The world economic crisis has diminished the capacity of our countries to participate actively in world trade. Our products are suffering from the instability of the markets of the developed countries and increasing protectionism. The marked continued decline in the prices of commodities exported by developing countries together with the deterioration of terms of trade have created difficulties that have adversely affected balances of payment and led to a negative transfer of resources. Without question  exports remain one of the main means by which developing countries may achieve economic growth; hence the need to work together to establish a just and equitable international trading system. In this respect  my country attaches special importance to the Uruguay negotiations  whose ultimate goal is to strengthen the multilateral trading system.Human solidarity prompts us to give priority to the poorest countries. Three years ago  in this very Hall  the international community  in response to Africa's appeal  adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  but that continent  which includes the largest number of least developed countries  is still feeling the negative effects of an economic crisis whose causes are beyond its control  that is thwarting all the efforts of the African Governments to revitalize their economies. In 1988 the mid-term review of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development concluded that the response of the international community had been inappropriate end inadequate. Despite the reforms undertaken at great political risk and significant social cost  the economic recovery which was the supposed objective of such policies is still beyond our reach.As far as we ate concerned  Congo  in conditions of extreme constraint  has courageously implemented the strengthened structural adjustment programme drawn up with the co-operation of the International Monetary Rind  the World Bank  and its creditors. Unfortunately  the efforts we have made have not so far yielded any significant results and we need more understanding from our partners if we are to achieve economic recovery in my country. The African frame of reference for structural adjustment programmes aimed at bringing about economic changes and recovery  prepared by the Economic Commission for Africa and endorsed by the OAU Summit in July of this year deserves the attention of the international community.Without a doubt  the deterioration of the environment requires strengthened international co-operation. This Organization offers an ideal framework for concerted action and co-ordination of efforts in this area. But it should be noted that the tendency to regard the degradation of the environment as an isolated phenomenon overlooks certain aspects of the problems. The question of environment protection  in our opinion  is part of the process of development itself. It is in this context that a whole governmental structure has been set up in the Congo to deal with the problem of the environment. That department is devising and executing a national environmental protection policy. Every year  on 6 Match the Congo celebrates the Day as a symbol of the policy of reforestation  a policy that has been carried out on an extremely large scale by specialized departments. It behoves the developed countries  whose primary responsibility for environmental pollution has been acknowledged  to come to the assistance of developing countries in their efforts to protect the environment by contributing additional financial resources and through the transfer of appropriate and ecologically sound technologies.We are nearing the end of a decade  a decade of frustrations for the developing countries but which none the less offers extremely promising prospects. Thus  as we turn our eyes to the future  let us hold fast to the hope that  as in political relations  confrontation will give way to dialogue between rich and poor  constructive dialogue aiming at a new  fairer and more equitable order. With this in mind  the United Nations has some important milestones ahead of it  including the followingÂ·  the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  and in particular  to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries  scheduled for April 1990 - a tremendously important session  for it will be addressing challenges of great importance to the world economy  the International Strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade (1991-2000)  a crucial decade which should ensure that mankind arrives at the threshold of the next millennium is an active spirit of solidarity and co-operation for a better world.But the building of such a world demands that the fundamental needs of populations be met. The international community  through this world Organization  must find decisive responses to that challenge  bolstered by a genuine solidarity pact between the rich and the poor  the North and the South.

"31",1524,"COL",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the people and the Government of Colombia please accept our congratulations and good wishes on your election  Sir  as President of the General Assembly. I am sure that you will preside with distinction over the deliberations of this body  which brings together the community of nations. Let me also associate myself with those who have already praised the splendid work done by your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo. In addition  may I pay tribute to the efforts of the Secretary-General  Xavier Perez de Cuellar  towards achieving world peace.This is the last time I shall address the General Assembly as President of Colombia. However  I am here today not only as President of my country hut also as a citizen of the world. This is the last time I shall address the General Assembly as President of Colombia. However  I am here today not only as President of my country but also as a citizen of the world.The terrible carnage of the Second World War gave birth to this body in the hope that nations standing together united could prevent the global madness of 50 years ago from ever happening again. Since then  in spite of the persistent efforts of the United Nations  mankind has continued to follow the destructive path of war in conflicts around the planet. Only the unimaginable devastating consequences of nuclear war have restrained us from falling once again into a world-wide conflagration. Yet  in spite of the fragile armed peace thus generated  the world has remained at war. Conflicts generated by ideology  poverty  injustice  excessive ambitions  and new increasingly by narcotics  have scarred the peace.Respect for national sovereignty underlies all our strategic thinking. Indeed  it is the basis for this United Nations. Yet now we find this newest threat  narcotics  and the accompanying terrorism that pays no respect; to borders. We  the community of nations gathered here  find ourselves under assault from an international criminal enterprise that respects none of our norms of sovereignty  borders or laws.To meet this new challenge we must  avail ourselves of those core founding values of the United Nations If we cannot act together in the face of this menace  then we will be abetting unrestrained growth in the use of drugs and the violence they generate. I am certain that Colombia will defeat the drug traffickers. But if this effort is not accompanied by a global commitment  then no victory can be achieved.The recent global outpouring of solidarity and support for Colombia has been a great encouragement to us in these difficult times. A new era is upon us  an era as critical as the one that led to the establishment of the United Nations. A new world war is being waged by an aggressor unrestrained by the traditional rules of engagement or by the responsibilities of national sovereignty. This aggressor is an insidious  global criminal network with enormous power and resources  a criminal enterprise that feeds on the illegal profits from the trafficking of drugs. As the Secretary-General states in his report to the Assembly this year ""Illicit use and traffic of drugs is now recognized as a social plaque afflicting both developed and developing countries. Although efforts to combat this scourge have intensified in recent years  estimates suggest that the monetary value of drug trafficking has recently surpassed that of international trade in oil and is second only to the arms trade. It is   chastening observation that humanity is so deeply mired in the commerce of degradation and death."" (A/44/1  p. 23)The members of these criminal cartels were born in many nations  and many of their leaders are called Colombian. But while some may have been born in my country let me be clear: they are Colombian in name alone. They are international fugitives on the run. They have no home. Colombia is not their homeland.I am here today at the United Nations to lay out the stark realities of this war against drug trafficking. Colombia is on the front line of this battle. For us this is no war of words. In Colombia the casualties of our struggle have been mounting for some time. About one month ago we suffered the tragic assassination of one of our finest national leaders  Luis Carlos Galan. In many ways his death has galvanized our nation and focused the attention of the world on this problem. But our war on drugs has been taking its toll for years. We have lost 12 Supreme Court Justices  an Attorney General and a Minister of Justice. We have lost members of Congress  judges  mayors  scores of journalists  thousands of soldiers and policemen and tens of thousands of Colombian citizens who were committed to the cause of democracy.Following my announcement last month of drastic measures using executive powers available under a stage of siege  the traffickers in narcotics have continued to engage in a cowardly reign of terror. They have threatened and retaliated against innocent families; they randomly strike at our cities and have bombed institutions such as our newspaper El Espectador that dare to speak out clearly against organized crime. In their aim to protect their illegal activities  the drug traffickers seek to destroy the will of our people and undermine our most precious institutions. Hear me well - they will fail. Colombia  one of the oldest and most stable democracies in Latin America  will prevail and emerge from this new trial stronger yet.In these past few weeks we have won some important victories. We are methodically breaking the back of the cartels  not just by confiscating and destroying many tons of cocaine Colombian authorities actually capture almost 80 per cent of the cocaine seized in the world. But our offensive goes far beyond that. Those responsible for the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan have already been captured. Thousands of suspects have been apprehended and millions of dollars in property - processing plants  bank accounts  communications equipment  aircraft  boats  houses and ranches - have been seize.""But all these victories will not be sufficient to win this war. That is why I am here today. Only through concerted international action can we hope to defeat the scourge of narcotics. The drug cartels have declared total war. This declaration of war is against the entire community of nations  against those whose young people are being poisoned by drugs and against those who  like Colombia  see their democracy and their institutions threatened by violence and terrorism. There are no boundaries to the death caused by the narcotics conflict  there are no safe havens from narco-terror - and now  there must be no safe haven  anywhere in the world  for the narco-traffickers. In this war  the time has come for the community of nations to choose sides.It may be difficult for many here to agree that this is a global wars they may see it as a scourge of this hemisphere alone. Many  in fact  do believe that cocaine is a scourge only of the Americas - produced in South America and consumed in North America. But that is not so  because  even as we meet here today  the tentacles of drug trafficking are reaching into Europe and the Par East. The aggressive search for new markets is no more respectful of oceans than it has been of borders. Wherever there are consumers there will be suppliers. And  indeed  cocaine is only one ugly manifestation of a much wider narcotics crisis. Make no mistake - this scourge touches us all.In solidarity  as a community of nations  this should be our plan of action. First  we simply must effectively stop the demand for these illicit drugs. It is the insatiable demand for drugs that fuels narco-terrorism and is one of the greatest threats to democracy in Latin America. Those who consume cocaine are contributing to the assassination of my people by the criminal drug cartels. No doubt somebody a few blocks from this Hall  in one of this city's fashionable neighbourhoods  taking his usual dose of cocaine in the civilized calm of his living room  would balk at this description. Yet as surely as if he pulled the trigger he is the slayer of those Colombian judges and policemen who have paid with their lives for trying to uphold the law and democracy.Every tact and every weapon in the war against narcotics pales into insignificance when compared to the need to reduce demand. The illegal profits produced by drug consumption are simply too great. I am sure that in Colombia we will defeat the drug traffickers  but someone  in some country  somewhere  will supply the drugs as long as the business remains so profitable. This happened in the case of marijuana: when it became too expensive for drug traffickers to operate in Colombia  because of effective law enforcement  they moved to California  Hawaii and other places. The only law that the drug traffickers do not break is the law of supply and demand.No society  no matter how rich  can afford to have its sons and daughters poisoned by cocaine  heroin  marijuana or any other deadly drug. In this regard  President Bush's national drug control strategy is a first  step in the right direction. We must insist on the message that illegal drugs are neither fashionable nor harmless  whether consumed at the glittering parties of the wealthy or in the ghetto. Drug users need to understand that in this war they are in the camp of the enemy  along with those who produce and push drugs. Let me take this opportunity to say how much I appreciate the initiative and leadership of the Prime Minister of Great Britain in her call for an international conference on the reduction of demand for narcotic drugs. Mrs. Thatcher has honoured me with her invitation  which I have accepted  to address the conference at its opening meeting next April.Secondly  our efforts to reduce the supply of cocaine also depend on international co-operation in stopping the illegal trade in chemicals which are essential to the processing of this drug. Generally  much attention is given to the production and processing of drugs; for example  too much emphasis has been placed on the cultivation of coca leaf in countries like Peru and Bolivia. Unfortunately  in contrast  little attention is given to controlling the supply of chemicals which are used to process cocaine and which come mainly from North America and Europe. None of them is manufactured in Colombia - all of those chemicals are snuggled into our country. Tightening controls on the manufacture and sale of those chemicals  as well as strengthening sanctions against their illegal shipment  must be one of our highest priorities. It takes more than coca leaf to produce cocaine. Without the needed chemicals there would be no narcotics. Let us exert pressure on the suppliers of those chemicals as firmly as we do on the poor peasant growers of coca leaf.Thirdly  the weapons used by the drug cartels to intimidate  maim and kill my people are not manufactured in Colombia. They are found on the international arms market where even the most sophisticated weapons are easily and legally bought. Let us make no mistake about this: those who sell arms to the narco-terrorists are even more guilty than the addicts whose demand for drugs fuels violence. Last year Colombia presented a draft resolution calling for restrictions on arms sales  but unfortunately consensus could not be found at the United Nations. We can no longer wait while this deadly trade continues. It is essential to adopt special measures to reduce and control arms sales to drug traffickers and terrorists. I call on all the nations of the world to stop this madness and stop it now.My Government also views with extreme seriousness the activities of foreign mercenaries in training and assisting narco-terrorists in Colombia. The international community must strengthen its condemnation of the murderous association of mercenaries with terrorists and drug traffickers. My Administration has not only condemned the presence of foreign mercenaries in our territory  it has also criminalized their activities and ordered their capture. These developments in Colombia make an urgent and indisputable case for this Assembly to approve the convention outlawing these criminal activities.Fourthly  international co-operation is an essential element in efforts to halt money-laundering. The drug cartels depend on the international banking system for the transfer of funds. A significant part of the criminal profits is invested in the industrialized nations - in bank accounts and bonds  in properties and in legal businesses. Somehow our sense of justice is warped when a poor farmer who feeds his family by growing coca is seen as a greater villain than the wealthy international banker who illegally transfers millions of dollars of drug money that finances terrorist actions against innocent people. If the international banking system co-operates  we can in the short term make great progress in the fight against the drug traffickers.Fifthly  each of us present here must press for the prompt ratification of the Vienna Convention. Painstakingly negotiated for many months  this Convention includes specific action on a wide variety of fronts  from penalties for consumption to seizure of ships on the high seas arid confiscation of properties. Upon my return to Colombia  I shall introduce the Vienna Convention to the Colombian Congress for consideration and study. For this Convention to be effective  it must be ratified and implemented by the entire community of nations.In addition  I wish to recommend to this Assembly two other multilateral initiatives: the first is to call a special session of this General Assembly addressed to all aspects of the global drug problem - consumption and production - which would consider urgent actions including those I am suggesting today; the second step - and perhaps the most important way of making concrete progress â is to establish an international working group at ministerial level  which would meet periodically to co-ordinate and refine specific anti-narcotics actions and to evaluate progress.Sixthly  central to political stability and maintenance of Colombia's democratic institutions is the strength of its economy. This is why international co-operation to maintain a strong and stable economy is so vital. In spite of the enormous destabilizing power of drug trafficking  Colombia has been able to remain firm in its will to fight that international criminal organization.It is critical to note that our economy is not dependent on the income from this illegal drug trade. In Colombia  that money is concentrated in speculative real estate activity and in money laundering. Its contribution to the growth of our economy is marginal. Colombia is not - and will not be - a narco-economy.Three years ago  I addressed the Assembly on the urgent - need to fight absolute poverty. Since then  my Government has embarked on an ambitious programme of social change aimed at transforming the living conditions of regions traditionally excluded from the benefits of development. The results can already be seen.In spite of the massive resources that the drug war requires  we will not relent in our pursuit of social change and economic progress. To that end  Colombia requires international and financial co-operation  but even more important is the adoption of commercial and trade measures which allow our economy greater access to markets in the industrialized countries and fair prices for our exports.The prime example is coffee  the traditional and principal source of income for Colombian farmers. The International Coffee Agreement has recently collapsed  with the result that Colombia will lose more than $400 million this year in income. Sixty-one developing countries stand to lose a total of 35 billion in income next year.We need the help of the United States and other countries to get the Coffee Agreement signed again. We cannot afford to talk idealistically of crop substitution in the case of the coca leaf while sabotaging Colombian farmers' main cash crop and the country's largest export. It is encouraging to note that President George Bush recently expressed his willingness to co-operate in finding solutions to the problems that led to the rupture of the Coffee Agreement. We expect that all other countries involved understand the seriousness of the situation and the need to revive one of the most successful examples of international economic co-operation.The weakening of the commodities market only aggravates the debt crisis. Foreign debt is a heavy burden for Latin America and is hindering economic growth. What is even more important  it is worsening the conditions of poverty for millions of Latin Americans. We must work together to find realistic and effective solutions to this vital problem. There is yet another - and related - struggle which has drawn the attention of the world and must be one of our highest priorities in the decade of the 1990s. It is  of course  the destruction of our natural resources and the deterioration of our environment.As I said recently in Manaos  in the meeting of member countries of the Amazon Co-operation Treaty  the industrialized countries have an ecological debt to all humanity. In less than two centuries  not only have most of the native forests of Europe and North American been razed  but industrial production has brought pollution  acid rain and destruction to the ozone layer. This is an ecological debt to future generations of all the countries of the world who will have to live with the consequences of the mindless way in which the developed countries have handled their natural resources.The way in which the industrialized nations can pay this debt is by directly contributing to third-world alternatives which preserve the environment  especially the tropical rain forests. I believe that these issues should be dealt with at the highest level of all Governments and of the United Nations. In Colombia we have already made progress in this respect. My Administration has already set aside more than 20 million hectares of rain forest and Indian reserves in the Amazon region  an area much larger than many European countries. Let us pledge to pay this debt for future generations.If the narcotics problem were not a priority at this moment I would have spoken to the Assembly today about another wars the struggle of the developing countries to eliminate poverty and social injustice. We should not lose sight of these fundamental goals. I would also have spoken in detail about the many important development projects we are promoting  the most important of which for the international community is the proposal to build a land bridge to link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through Colombian territory. The railroads  highways and pipelines to be built will provide vital new links for global shipping.This is indeed a historic moment  and future generations will judge our actions. In this war on drugs there have been many heroes of many nationalities willing to give their lives. Many are well known  but even more are unknown. Luis Carlos Galan died because he dared to speak out. Guillermo Cano  the editor of El Espectador  was gunned down because he would not be silenced. The thousands of soldiers and Colombian citizens who have fallen have died because of their commitment to this struggle. These brave men and women have not died in vain. The entire community of nations must build on their sacrifice to defeat the curse of drugs.The record of human history is strewn with the wreckage of failed civilizations. We now face a new and global threat. We must act now before it is too late. If we confront the narcotics menace with boldness and determination we can win. With international commitment and co-operation  we can make this plague of the twentieth century obsolete. It is my cherished hope that the school children of the twenty-first century will learn about drugs and about terrorism only from their history books - the history of great plagues that were eradicated.We should be under no illusion? about the burdens that lie ahead. Victory will take time. Winston Churchill might have been describing the road before us today when he told the House of Commons in 1940: ""Death and sorrow will be the companions of our journey  hardships our garment  constancy and valour our only shield. We must be united; we must be undaunted"".Let us declare today that together we shall use the last decade of this century to bury the international scourge of drugs  ""together we can and must succeed."
"32",1565,"COM",44,1989,"ï»¿Sir  I should like first to convey to you  on behalf of my delegation  our heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly of our Organization. By electing you to that high office  the Assembly has thus paid a tribute to you  an eminent diplomat  and to your personal qualities. It has also paid a tribute to your country  Nigeria  a country friendly to my country  and to the active role it has played in the Special Committee against Apartheid. We wish you every success in discharging your new responsibilities  and you may rest assured of our full co-operation.I should like to take this opportunity also to congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  whose devotion  authority and competence made the work of the previous session so orderly and positive. I also wish to take this opportunity once again to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his constant constructive attitude and effective work Â£or international peace.Since last year a new era based on dialogue and consultation has emerged in relations between the two super-Powers. This detente can only be beneficial for world peace. It is also encouraging to note that these positive changes are gradually starting to allay the attitude of distrust that had been prevalent since the cold war. This situation is also a sign of a new language based on improved mutual understanding aid a common quest for peaceful solutions.However  the battle is far from over  since this phenomenon is not irreversible. That is why we must remain on our guard and see to it that this dynamic process continues in the interests of mankind. Accordingly  the role of our Organization is decisive to the extent that each time conflicts cannot be peacefully resolved through dialogue  our Organization must give proper attention to such questions.In these developments  the redrawing of the international landscape presupposes compliance by all States with the united Nations Charter  bearing in mind that a group of countries  whatever its power  should not presume to be the custodial of the world or that other States should merely be bystanders.From the standpoint of politics  while we welcome the fact that some conflicts are being resolved aid are on the way to relative peace  we must  on the other hand  recognize that in the economic field no meaningful progress has been made. Whereas the developed countries have managed to overcome their difficulties aid have experienced new economic and technological development prospects  it must be acknowledged that in the third world countries the tendency has been for conditions to become worse. The continued deterioration of the terms of trade has worsened the paradoxical phenomenon of the transfer of resources from the poorest countries to the richer countries. Clearly  this situation is particularly distressing for my country  Comoros  since it has suffered so acutely from the adverse effects of the current international economic situation. Comoros is a small country consisting of scattered islands  with a lack of natural resources  all of which has impeded our development. There are other factors that are just as serious-  such as selling our export products at a loss or their continuing depreciation  which applies to vanilla  clove  copra and perfume essences which have had to compete on world markets with synthetic products. This phenomenon has been made worse because of the unfavourable terms of loans for investment  which have considerably worsened the public debt and  on the other hand  a disturbing population explosion  high unemployment rates  'and a treasury deficit  which have made the country very much dependent on foreign technical and financial assistance.In order for members better to understand the difficulties that these constraints have caused our economy  I should like to give some indication of the general state of the economy of our country. Following independence  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros had only a rudimentary road system. This impelled the Comorian Government  under the enlightened guidance of President Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane  to establish an economic development policy to open the country to the outside world. Naturally that was only possible with the financial assistance of the international community. To that end  a round table of donors  the first of its kind  was organized in 1984 in Moroni  our capital.That meeting made the international community aware of our difficulties and led to a thorough examination of ways and means whereby we could revitalize our young economy. Thus our country was provided with a basic infrastructure. Inter alia  the road system was gradually improved  a deep-water port was built  and an international airport provided. In addition  other measures were taken to bring about great budgetary discipline in order to improve public finances.Despite these efforts  medium-term economic prospects aid the financial situation are still matters of concern. Given these circumstances  the Government of the Comoros took the decision to negotiate with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund a structural-adjustment programme to create conditions for a sounder economy. In this effort  the assistance of the international community is indispensable. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to appeal to all people of good will - bilateral and multilateral donors aid non-governmental organizations - to give us valuable assistance in the form of the financial aid necessary to support our adjustment programme.Allow me now briefly to touch upon the international political situation. We note with satisfaction that detente is almost becoming a reality  thanks to the better understanding that has led to the easing of various pockets of tension. It is up to the international community to make every effort to preserve these valuable achievements.In Namibia  the process towards independence and peace has seen some positive developments. It is up to this Organization to ensure that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is implemented strictly in order that the people of Namibia may be led to national sovereignty in dignity. We reaffirm the imperative need to put an end to the horrendous system of apartheid in order to create a just  democratic  multiracial society in South Africa.On the Maghreb  we welcome the climate of detente and co-operation that the Heads of State of the region have decided to establish. We encourage them to continue along this path  which we believe will open up favourable prospects for the implementation of the Secretary-General's peace plan for Western Sahara.The withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan has not put an end to the conflict there - far from it. We must support the efforts of this Organization in its quest  with the parties concerned  for ways and means of restoring peace in that country.Turning to the Korean peninsula  we reiterate once again the hope that the two Koreas - North and South - will persevere  through dialogue  in their efforts towards reunification of the country. We continue to believe that the admission of the two Koreas to membership of the united Nations will be a factor for peace and stability in the region.On Cambodia  the process of dialogue in the quest for a peaceful solution should be continued. We call upon the parties concerned to demonstrate good will in order that peace may be restored to that country.On the question of the Middle East  we note with bitter disappointment that the situation is still frozen. Indeed  the Palestinian people continues to be the target of the Zionist occupier aid has been experiencing the most humiliating suffering  characterized by harsh repression  deportation  devastation of property  and the bombing of homes. We continue to affirm that there can be no just  lasting peace in the Middle East so long as the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are not recognized and effectively exercised. In this regard  we support the idea of convening an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all parties concerned  including  naturally  the Palestine Liberation Organization (FIO)  the sole  authentic representative of the Palestinian people.As a corollary of the Israeli-Arab conflict  the situation in Lebanon is still marked by violence and suffering. We believe it is time for Lebanon fully to regain its sovereignty  independence  national unity and territorial integrity. That is why my country supports the efforts of the international community - notably those of the Tripartite Committee - in seeking political solutions that can restore peace and achieve national reconciliation in Lebanon.As regards the Iran-Iraq conflict  we welcome the cessation of war between those two countries after so many years of suffering and atrocities. We exhort them resolutely to commit themselves to a process of negotiation under the aegis of the united Nations Secretary-General  on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).My country  like all other countries of the region  reiterates its full support fear the idea of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace  a demilitarised  nuclear-free zone. We therefore support the plan to hold  in Sri Lanka in 1990  an international conference devoted to this problem.I cannot conclude without saying something about a problem that is of great concern to the Comorian people and to the entire international community. Naturally  I am referring to the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. This item is again on the General Assembly's agenda. I do not wish to anticipate the debate on the subject that will take place at a later stage. For the time being  I will merely express the profound concern of the people aid Government of Comoros at the persistence of this problem  which has existed for too long. Representatives will agree with me that the problem merits a final solution in keeping with the aspirations of the Comorian people as a whole. That is why  in a statement  the President of the Republic  Mr. Ahmed Abdallah Abderemane said he hoped ""that thewinds of detente blowing in international relations might influence this matter favourably"".We hope that the dialogue that has been established at the level of Heads of State between France and Comoros may lead to a satisfactory solution based on law and justice. The international community must continue to lend support to the efforts of the Comorian people until its just cause triumphs.On the threshold of the last decade of the century  there are still many formidable challenges before us.Whether in the economic or the political spheres  mankind as a whole needs much imagination in confronting the host of problems it faces. Obviously  this will require greater solidarity and more equity in sharing resources and knowledge - the only conditions that can provide effective guarantees for peace in the world. To that end  our Organization should play its full part  because it remains the only bulwark against excesses and abuses that generate conflicts.My Government solemnly reaffirms its dedication to the ideals of peace and justice set forth in the Charter  and we shall spare no effort to support the united Nations."
"33",1604,"CPV",44,1989,"ï»¿I am very pleased to greet you  Sir  and offer you my warm congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your election to this high post is recognition of your wide-ranging experience as a political figure and a diplomat. I am certain that in this very complex but fruitful period in international life you will be able to guide our work with the competence  intelligence and dynamism required to tackle the many issues on our agenda.I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the admirable  wise way in which he guided the work of the forty-third session.I wish also to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose skill in carrying out his functions has time and again shown his unstinting devotion to the cause of peace and the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The progress made in the peaceful solution of regional conflicts is due  in no small measure  to his experience and his enlightened approach.In the course of this century  never have prospects for understanding and co-operation among peoples been as promising as they are today. Detente in the relations between the great Powers and the significant reversal of the cold war and of ideological confrontation  as well as the progress made in the negotiations on disarmament and in the negotiated solution of regional conflicts  proclaim a new philosophy of coexistence between States leading to greater confidence and better understanding  thus signalling the advent of a more secure future for mankind.Indeed  all signs indicate that we are heading towards a new order in international relations based  we hope  no longer on ideological confrontation between systems  nor on the strategic interests of domination or zones of interests  but rather on the plurality of interests of States and the safeguarding of the just aspirations of peoples to justice  liberty  well-being and development.In this context we are pleased with the results of the recent summit of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which  after an exhaustive analysis of the international situation and the dangers occurring in the world  considered ways to solve the problems confronting the international community and determined a framework for future action to make it possible for mankind as a whole to meet the challenges of the next millennium.Recent developments in the international situation give us cause for optimism. A new message of peace and a renewed quest for negotiated solutions are emerging. This new situation will favour the promotion and safeguarding of the national interests of States  in particular the small States. We now have a unique historical opportunity  and hence  all possible efforts must be made to consolidate the current positive trends and make them irreversible  thus ushering in a new dimension in relations among States. There is no doubt that important steps have already been taken in this direction; however  there remains a need for greater confidence and bolder actions.All countries should be able to make their contribution to building peace. In this context  we would stress the importance of the United Nations as a vital institution in which global problems affecting all mankind can be discussed and resolved by the joint efforts and action of all Members.All the fundamental questions have been considered in the Assembly  which is undoubtedly a truly democratic forum. Here all countries  large and small  can speak of their concerns  their aspirations and their fears.That is why the Organization is useful  as a factor in the political and cultural liberation of peoples; in peace and disarmament; in defence of human dignity and human rights as well as international legality and security; and in the promotion of co-operation and assistance for economic and social development.The United Nations certainly contributes to the formation and strengthening of a new universal conscience  which  being based on international law and legality  defends the solidarity of peoples; the equality of cultures; tolerance and pluralism; and the common destiny of mankind.It is in this universal conscience that the small countries find their main support for the strengthening of their independence  security and development. This universal conscience is also the basis of the extraordinary achievements of the United Nations  and in particular of the General Assembly  where peoples of all cultures  races and religions come together and where the objective of universality becomes a practical reality.This universal conscience is revolted by the violence and catastrophic wars of this century  whose horrors should always be present in our collective memory  to remind us that conflicts between States are not resolved by force of arras  particularly in a period of great technological progress such as that in which we are living now. That is why we must support the initiatives aimed at strengthening the Organization. Cape Verde has taken a keen interest in the expressions of concern in recent years about adapting the United Nations to today's needs in international politics. The 1986 reform created foundations which  if built upon with respect for the principles and basic purposes of the Charter  will be a positive factor in a process which could lead the Organization to a new stage in its history.Administrative reform will not in itself guarantee that the United Nations will adapt to meet the needs of today's world. We believe that for such changes to be made there must be a re-examination of the Organization's tasks in order to identify questions which  because of their importance and timeliness  can serve as focal points and catalysts for action.Until the beginning of this decade  among the Organization's many spheres of activity decolonisation was one of its main objectives. For some years decolonisation galvanized diplomatic activity at the United Nations and gave it a sense of purpose. We ourselves are the fruit of that very praiseworthy action by the United Nations in favour of peoples. When  in the midst of the national liberation struggle  our immortal leader  Amilcar Cabral  stated that we were the anonymous fighters of the United Nations  that showed the profound influence of the Organization's ideals on the growth of awareness of the basic rights of peoples to freedom and independence.Today the Organization's actions should be re-oriented around another great objective capable of stimulating its diplomatic activity and elevating dialogue between nations to a new level. The present climate of political detente and the broadening of international co-operation require a multilateral approach to the great issues of our times. The United Nations provides a suitable framework for dealing with them and solving them. Our collective survival is more and more tied to the existence of the United Nations. Peace  disarmament and security are concepts so closely linked that each is a vital condition for the others. We need the participation and shared responsibility of all the countries of the international community if we are to have a world of peace and of peaceful coexistence between States. When we speak of peace  we are referring not only to peace between the big countries  or between them and the small countries  but also to peace between the small countries themselves. Without it  how could we call upon the great Powers to promote peace between themselves?My country  which sees itself as a factor for peace and stability in its geographical region  pays a heartfelt tribute to the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union for the renewed hope of peace that the detente in their relations has brought to mankind. We urge them to continue their efforts to consolidate the results they have achieved and to make them irreversible.Peace  stability and the ability to see ahead in international relations are the prerequisites for progress and development and for the creation of a world of justice and freedom and the physical and spiritual flowering of the human being. Experience accumulated over the past 15 years of national independence has taught us the complexity of development  which requires domestic efforts  but also effective and significant international co-operation. If the underdeveloped countries should adopt realistic and pragmatic economic policies and promote the skilful promotion and exploitation of their natural resources  the international community must be able to guarantee programmed long-term assistance that is sustained and predictable.The economic backwardness and the social and political instability of the third world  particularly of the African continent  demonstrate the relationship between development and peace. To be lasting and universal  peace must be based on a correct evaluation and solution of the problem of underdevelopment. As one of the most vulnerable African countries. Cape Verde continues to follow with great concern the situation in Africa. Despite the continent's enormous economic potential  its situation is critical  with grave social consequences that include the fact that hundreds of thousands are falling victim to hunger.Experience shows that development is above all a national responsibility  that the peoples concerned should be closely involved in the process of development and that our countries will have to review their policies  improve their management methods and promote the necessary reforms in order to benefit as much as possible from their own resources. To achieve physical well-being and guarantee social justice for our peoples  victims over the centuries of economic and social domination and marginalization  many African countries have had to adopt development strategies of the past  or to perpetuate past economic policies which do not meet the conditions of countries emerging from decolonisation. On the other hand  perhaps we have not been able to find the median isms to stimulate and mobilize the creative energies of our populations for the process of development.The results of the rupture in the traditional structures of our countries could be the underlying reason for the weakness of existing relationships between political power and society. At the present stage in the life of our peoples  any development process requires dialogue and permanent interaction between political power sources and society. Any development process requires technical capacity and professional competence. The lack of adequate human resources in independent African countries has been one of the major obstacles to the development of the continent. The reasons for this are very well known and the impact it has had on African economies is extremely clear today.On the domestic scene  we think the conditions are now in place for economic development  so long as national efforts are accompanied by effective and substantial international support. For  with the growing interdependence of the world today  Africa's development will require the financial and technological co-operation of the industrialized countries.It is generally recognized today that foreign debt is one of the main obstacles to the economic growth of the third world countries. Indeed  the foreign-debt burden  which has become intolerable  is the reason for the deterioration of the living conditions of most of our countries and the difficulties we witness in the adoption of appropriate economic policies. Programmes of structural adjustment and other efforts agreed to for the purpose of mobilizing internal resources  including more effective utilization of investments  have not brought about the expected results because of debt-servicing payments.The solution to the debt crisis will have to be fair  flexible and oriented towards development  while being based on shared responsibility and broader political dialogue. The situation  far from being straightforward  is complex and closely linked with the deterioration in the terms of trade  the fall in raw-material prices  the reduction of public aid to development  high interest rates  exchange-rate fluctuations and the net transfer of developing countries' resources to the developed countries  particularly through debt-servicing payments. We appreciate the measures already taken by some creditor countries to alleviate the burden of the indebted countries in serious difficulty.In the context of the solution which must be found  we should take proper account of the needs of the small and vulnerable countries. Nevertheless  we note with gratitude the international community's praiseworthy contribution to Cape Verde's development process.The progress we have seen in the area of the protection of human rights shows us that freedom is the best possible context within which to release man's creative energy. For us  human rights are intimately tied to development. They will not be protected by the mere abolition of arbitrary imprisonment or the simple recognition of the right to free expression. Nor will human rights be protected when thousands of persons are still dying of hunger every year  and thousands more in many countries - even developed countries - continue to live without decent housing and assistance when they are sick and old. Only the creation of the material bases for life and the raising of the professional and cultural standards and the level of awareness of the people can stabilize conditions ensuring respect for basic human rights as well as a more human and just society.Among the most important problems on the present international scene which we are considering during this session is the question of the environment and the need to protect and preserve it and the question of the link between economic growth and development and the defence of the environment. The interdependence of countries aid the need to strengthen multilateralism in this area are clear.Indeed  the signs of deterioration in the environment resulting in climatic changes  the warming of the atmosphere and the reduction of the ozone layer seem finally to have convinced us of the extreme need for the adoption of collective measures to put an end to this deterioration and improve the ecological conditions of life on Earth.The deterioration of our environment is of particular concern to us in Cape Verde. Located as we are in a region subject to the harsh climate of the Sahara desert  we have had to wage a tremendous struggle against the onslaughts of nature by fighting the effects of drought and desertification  while at the same time developing an ambitious programme of reforestation. That is our contribution to improving the global environment  and it will prove all the more significant if greater international support is given to us.We hope that the International community  and particularly the United Nations conference on the environment to be held in 1992  will help us to find appropriate solutions to these problems  because the changes observed in the climate  desertification  the reduction of the ozone layer and the pollution of the atmosphere seriously threaten the lives of all of us and require adequate and effective measures  as well as effective international co-operation  under the auspices of the United Nations.Because of the human suffering  poverty and the uprooting of populations and the resulting despair  we cannot remain indifferent to the difficult  vulnerable situation of millions of refugees and displaced parsons in various parts of the world. In Africa  and particularly in the southern part of the continent  the situation is very serious indeed: Continued efforts are required to alleviate the suffering of thousands of human beings who are victims of the instability in the region.We are gratified at the praiseworthy work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the contributions made by the host countries and the international community towards alleviating the suffering of these many victims. However  we feel that this problem can be solved in a lasting way only when its underlying causes - which result from the combined effects of ethnic  cultural  religious  racial  political and other types of discrimination - are eliminated.Another question with which we are concerned is the urgent need to put an end to the traffic in and illegal use of drugs  which have reached alarming proportions and are extremely difficult to control. In view of the harmful effects of the use of drugs  with the resulting increase in the crime rate  the international community must exert co-ordinated efforts to fight this scourge  which is a true crime against mankind. We therefore support all the efforts to eliminate this evil from the face of the Earth.With respect to southern Africa it seems to us that  after the long and arduous struggle of the Namibian people for the independence of their country  illegally occupied by South Africa  we have finally arrived at a decisive moment with the progress made in the process of implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Once the initial problems are overcome  we hope that the process will lead to truly normal and free elections this November that will culminate in the independence of Namibia. We are convinced that South Africa  whose credibility is at stake in Namibia  will be able strictly to comply with the timetable and other conditions laid down in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the implementation of which will be a victory for all: for the people of Namibia  for the African continent  for the international community in general  and for the United Nations in particular. Another fundamental question that must be dealt with by the international community is the need to persevere in the search for ways and means to create conditions that will facilitate and accelerate the elimination of apartheid and bring about a just  democratic and well-balanced multiracial society in South Africa. In this connection we encourage all anti-apartheid forces aid all those  both within and outside South Africa  who favour change to continue increasing pressure on the Pretoria regime to bring it to enter into negotiations with the legitimate representatives of the South African people in order to dismantle apartheid and achieve agreement on the measures necessary to change the country into a non-racial democracy. In the new society  where all will benefit from the sane political rights regardless of race  culture  colour or creed  all people must enjoy universally recognized human rights  fundamental freedoms and civil freedoms.Therefore  within the framework of a strategy to eliminate apartheid  which is of concern and interest to the international community and the African countries in particular  there is a message of hope and confidence that should give everyone a reason to struggle for change. That message should be directed towards the forces that advocate change as well as those that oppose it - to the African countries and the anti-apartheid forces in the rest of the world. This is the great challenge new facing Africa and the international community. By taking up that challenge we shall take a considerable step towards the avoidance of future violence and the strengthening of peace and international security.In this context the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique have adopted courageous measures to allow peace end stability to return to our two sister countries. We are certain that the international community as a whole  out of respect for the sovereign rights of those countries  will support those efforts  whose sole objective is the achievement of dialogue  understanding and peace.One feature of contemporary international relations is the emergence of small States on the world scene. Most of them have come into existence over the last 20 years as a result of the decolonisation process successfully carried out under the auspices of the United Nations. Most of them have small territories  small populations and limited resources  well as little political influence  small military forces and modest economic capacities. Many small States are island States  and vulnerable. They have specific needs that must be appropriately assessed and addressed in order to find the necessary solutions to their problems.Politically and strategically  those States tend to favour neutrality. The structural problems resulting from their physical dimensions and the instability caused by dependency require a stable environment in which the international community has an important role to play to safeguard their security and assist in their development  thus creating conditions in which they can face and master their destinies with greater confidence  effectiveness and predictability.The small States can play a useful role in international relations precisely because they have neither the multiple interests nor the strategic ambitions of more powerful States and can thus make a positive contribution to international peace and security.We should not like to conclude without referring to another phenomenon that affects the small States: the question of ethnic and cultural minorities  which has become more acute in recent times. As a small country in a growing community of some 150 States having different sizes  degrees of power  economic capacities and objectives  we are very sensitive to the question of the ethnic and cultural minorities  whose rights and guarantees of rights are often denied. That is why we reject any form of racial and social discrimination and defend the international legal order in a multiracial and multicultural world that should give broad safeguards and guarantee those rights for all.Despite the tremendous progress made in the area of human rights  effective protection of and respect for the fundamental rights of minorities is an area in which our voices and our actions  tragically  have been violated and have failed. That is why we in Cape Verde are deeply concerned by events in various regions of the world in which the rights of ethnic minorities are violated flagrantly and systematically. The spiritual wealth of mankind lies in its ethnic and cultural diversity. When the culture of a minority is repressed or its existence threatened we all lose  because that constitutes an attack on the fundamental rights of man and when a culture is suppressed or disappears  that is an irreparable loss. The ethnic and cultural minorities deserve the full protection of the United Nations and the international community in general. As a peace-loving country whose people are striving for development  and as a nation which is an integral part of the United Nations family  Cape Verde will continue to make its contribution on the national  regional and international levels to the promotion and realization of the ideals of social justice  to the strengthening of the brotherhood among peoples  and the creation of conditions for prosperity and well-being for all  in a joint universal effort to ensure respect for human rights and the rights of peoples."
"34",1649,"CRI",44,1989,"ï»¿I salute you  Sir  on behalf of the Costa Rican people and wish you all success as President of the General Assembly. I salute also a tireless friend in the efforts for peace in Central America and the world  Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.As President of Costa Rica I came here for the first time in 1986. I said then that Central America was on the brink of war. I have returned today for the last time during my term of office to tell the Assembly that we are on the verge of peace. Yesterday I came to ask for your help and today I come to thank you. Then  we had to stop a war*  now we must build peace. How quickly the world has changed in these few years. Brother has stopped killing brother in many places on this Earth. I ask myself: Where are the winners of those wars? Where are the vanquished? Let us not be afraid to say it; the only winners were those who had the courage to a peace accord? the only winners were those who had the courage to change history. Wherever violence continues  everyone is the loser.The line between war and peace is a difficult and treacherous path. It also bears witness to resentments that persist for many years. At times the decisions of the few  immersed in ideological dogmatism of religious fanaticism  are enough to tip the scale towards destruction and death. On other occasions  men in faraway places encourage armed conflicts  disregarding the pain of those who are dying. It takes very little to turn peace one day into violence the next. It is also true that individuals and peoples can make a difference in favour of peace. The strength of forgiveness and dialogue can silence the guns and put everyone to work towards finding real solutions. Our destiny is not carved in stone and it is our responsibility to fashion a different future.There are many who are unsure whether to commit themselves to the path of dialogue and reconciliation for fear of being called naive. It is easier to say that wars will always exist and wash one's hands of it  as did the great traitors in the history of humankind who could have prevented murder but chose to remain silent  who could have stopped war but encouraged it  who could have fought poverty but chose to ignore it. I am not afraid to say that the war which threatened to spread in so many directions has turned into an opportunity to build peace. My people are proud of having contributed to that change. We will not be prisoners of our past  not even for the sake of caution  when perpetuating that past violates the rights of men and women  limits their freedom  allows poverty and leads to war. The solutions to the problems that have been besetting us for so many years require imagination and courage. Let there be change. Let everything change so that hope can bring peoples together on one unified path.Even though hunger is increasing in the world and inequalities between rich and poor countries are widening  the scale between war and peace has tipped towards peace. The direction of history in the struggle between dictatorship and the people has tipped in favour of freedom and democracy. Violence has not lessened pain  but severely increased it. It has not resolved problems  but has created other  bigger ones. The risks involved in forging a different future are less thanthe pain and evil that will result if we persist in following the past blindly  to begin by ending war is the right way  but if we cannot build peace immediately we will have lost everything before we wake up to reality.The Central American Peace Plan continues to move forward. The presidential summit meetings in El Salvador and Honduras have strengthened our commitment to fight to end the violence and improve democracy. The armed struggle in Nicaragua has stopped and thousands upon thousands of young people in that country owe their lives to that courageous agreement. An electoral process has begun  and in February 1990 the people of Nicaragua will elect a new president and parliament. With the help of many and with international supervision  elections in our sister country will be fair and equal guarantees will be given to all alike. We must continue to foster the reconciliation of the people of Nicaragua  the return of those who are in exile; the silencing of the guns that are still being fired; the end to violence demanded by reason  mercy and the peace plan.The next presidential summit will be held in December in Nicaragua. That will be an opportunity for us all to verify the progress made towards the free and democratic elections that the entire world hopes to see. Nothing at that meeting could contribute to peace more greatly than an agreement to reduce the Sandinista armed forces substantially. This demilitarisation is an indispensable prerequisite if we want to achieve peace in our region. Because I have these hopes and will work for them  I was not afraid to come here in the past and say that Sandino had been murdered anew  for his struggle for freedom had been betrayed. I say today that I believe there is hope for the people of Nicaragua to become reconciled in democracy and freedom so that Sandino will rise again for all of them and so that together they can continue to pursue the revolution for freedom in freedom.This month in Costa Rica  representatives of the Government of El Salvador will meet with leaders of the guerrilla forces of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. The purpose of the meeting is to negotiate an end to the hostilities. With God's help they will be able to reach an agreement similar to that obtained by the people of Nicaragua in Sapoa for the sake of peace. All the brutality in El Salvador has not led to any solution. Let anyone in this room rise and say without hesitation  in the presence of the nations of the world  what problems were solved by encouraging and supporting violence in our tortured Central America. I ask all those who can help to contribute to putting an end to the senseless killing and destruction in El Salvador. We demand an end to a decade of pain that has yielded no gains and provided no future.Once more  as we come closer to the cease-fire negotiations  the conflicts and acts of war which torment that sister country have increased. Those who think that by demonstrating greater destructive power they will gain an advantage in the dialogue are badly mistaken  fin increase in violence reveals desperation and confirms weakness. There is no longer any sympathy in the world for heroic acts that turn into cowardice  for honour where blood is spilled.Honduras rightly asks that the Nicaraguan Contras established in its territory immediately put down their weapons and return home. In Guatemala a few lunatics have escalated their acts of violence. They too will find no sympathy in a world that will not again confuse courage with terrorism nor fanaticism with the struggle for freedom. The doors of democracy have been opened for Guatemala  and we can all contribute to widening them. To abandon this path is to miss the call of history for democracy in that beloved sister nation. In the past few years the balance in Central America has tipped in favour of freedom  democracy and peace. Much remains to be done. We are very far from achieving the political coexistence we seek for every country and for the region  but we are moving in the right direction.Everyone from His Holiness Pope John Paul II to the United Nations agrees that development and peace are inseparable. In the lands surrounding my country they are proceeding on dangerously separate paths. All the countries of the region  apart from Costa Rica  have become poorer. It is urgent to reverse that trend.We are not unaware that many wish to help us. Nor can we fail to mention that only very slowly and in very few instances have good intentions materialized into facts. We shall maintain confidence in the United Nations special plan of economic assistance for Central America adopted by the Assembly  in the San Jose accords  which reflect the co-operation of the European Economic Community  in the Sanford Commission  which promotes development programmes that rise above political differences  and in the Caribbean Basin initiative  which jives preferential treatment to our exports. We shall never give up hope  because without development our peace will not last. In a few years we have to reverse more than 100 years of injustice and oppression.The anguish of war  the hopes we share for a true peace and our dreams of sustainable development do not remove us from the challenges facing all mankind. We have not distanced ourselves from the political  technological and economic changes of our times. We are not unaware of the fact that imminent ecological disasters have become as serious a threat as war and are a harbinger of death  suffering and hunger. We are neither an economic nor a military Power. Nor are we merely part of a problem. We are part of a solution; we are defenders of ideas; we aspire to be a moral force. This year we shall celebrate 100 years of democracy in Costa Rica  and we have already celebrated more than 40 years as a people without weapons. We see a world weary of violence  tired of poverty. We see a world desperately seeking change. In the division between those who take refuge in the past and those who assume the risks of constructing a different future  my people is on the road of the future.In this scenario  in which ideological walls are tumbling down and what was the iron curtain is opening up  and in which the wire fences that imprisoned nations are being cut  we can look without fear at the promise of freedom. Confrontation has not helped us solve our most basic differences. On the contrary  it contributed to spreading selfishness  to permitting dogmatic and fanatical men to govern in respectability. We mistook arrogance for courage. We made heroes of those who merely spoke against the powerful and promised to see justice done with arms. We forgot to work towards solutions  to make a commitment with respect to the suffering of our peoples  to accept the primary responsibility for taking up the challenges facing us. No one can be unaware that we have an opportunity to make a different world  to surmount through co-operation an agenda common to all  nations rich and poor  nations old and young.The struggle for human rights must now and forever be without boundaries - without boundaries  the task of promoting peace in order to banish violence in the solution of our problems; without boundaries  the condemnation of terrorist acts; without boundaries  the determination to strengthen and buttress democracies  for never in history have democratic Governments made war upon one another; without boundaries  the obligation to take account of environmental concerns in our development plans; without boundaries  the commitment to free our children from the drugs that are killing and destroying them; without boundaries  our efforts to ensure that no nuclear weapon will ever be launched again  so that gradually  by replacing feat with understanding  we can destroy those weapons; withoutboundaries  the commitment to control and reduce conventional weapons  and the disarmament that has become possible in this new era must guarantee resources for development and not only for the conquest of space; without boundaries  our hope for markets free from protectionism  for fair prices for commodities and for equitable opportunities for the growth of all peoples. Let us make this closing decade of the twentieth century one of peace and bread for all the world.Much remains to be done before we finish tearing down the walls that reflect: the dogmatism and hatred of the past. Much remains to be done before we can commit ourselves to a common agenda. Beyond those two concerns  the greatest risk is that we will raise even higher walls separating the rich nations from the poor  separating the North from the South  ""today  when a farmer who works in the lands and villages south of the Rio Grande crosses the border or the sea to enter a developed country  he gains 100 years of development for himself and 200 years for his children. In the past  millions came from Europe to the Americas in search of an opportunity to win the race against hunger  to open up horizons of freedom. Today we must ensure opportunities for balanced development for all nations and see to it that the walls that are torn down do not consolidate new alliances based on economic selfishness. If that happens  not only will the world's poor be the losers  but the rich too will find the ozone layer full of holes and their souls full of drugs. We must view the common agenda as a joint responsibility and share burdens and benefits without fear.Certain countries and many people in various parts of the world refuse to co-operate in strengthening a new world. Matters remain that have not been settled  which causes an uncertainty that turns even the brave into cowards. It is of vital importance for us in Central America that the strict separation between East and West grow less rigid. If war is to end  it is crucial to abandon spheres of hegemony and make a commitment to work for freedom and democracy. For those who used to think that the only road to justice was the road of weaponry  the time has come to come down from the mountain and join the democratic process. I wrote the following the leader of the Soviet Unions""I urge you once again  Mr. Gorbachev  to lay down arms in Central America. The young Russians who are dying today in Afghanistan have been punishment enough for a mistaken policy. They troops will return to the Soviet Union along the honourable path of courageously correcting one's mistakes. Correct also your policy towards Central America. let us also hold talks on eliminating conventional weapons  which today are killing our children and the children of the third world.""The answer  although slow in coming compared with the speed with which our young people were dying daily in Central America  was positive. The Soviet Government agreed to work for peaceful understanding and to suspend all military aid.It saddens me to report that shipments of weapons to the region continue. In Cuba  the leaders seem to have decided to remain in the Sierra Maestra and turn their back on the new world that is being born. I reiterate here my impassioned plea to all nations of the world to halt military assistance to the Central American region. As Cuba withdrew its soldiers from Angola  it must withdraw its support for armed opposition in the lands of Central America.The problems that hinder our struggle for peace have been compounded by the threats and evil deeds of drug traffickers and by fears arising from the setbacks suffered by democracy in Panama. In Costa Rica  we approved  with the unanimous vote of our legislative assembly one of the strictest laws ever enacted to fight drug trafficking aid all commerce related to it. We are fighting and we will fight on  without faltering  for that objective  because our homeland will never provide refuge or respite for these criminals. It must be part of our commitment to peace and to a common world agenda  that Central America become drug-free. Our countries must not be tainted by drug production and trafficking.We have given our total support to President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia  to whom  in a letter written on behalf of the people of Costa Rica I have said:""When one is faced with such a difficult and crucial challenge  one cannot compromise. There can be no agreement with those who threaten everyone and everything with savage violence and disrespect our most sacred values. International solidarity is a categorical imperative. We cannot become accomplices  with a minute of silence or a minute of fear. You must triumph - for the greatness of your people and the dignity of the Americas."" I repeat here that in the noble struggle of President Barco Vargas  each and every one of us is a foot soldier.I shall never tire of repeating that the alliance for freedom and democracy in the Americas  for which I called on the day I took office as President of Costa Rica  is our only hope for a lasting peace and strengthening of the foundations of economic development. There are still authoritarian Governments in Latin America  however  and that threatens our coexistence.In Panama  our neighbour and sister nation  the path of oppression has also become the road of impoverishment. The sooner the Panamanians themselves can solve their problems through free elections  the lesser will be the tragedy that people endures. In Panama  principles of the supranational courses of the new world agenda have been violated - principles that protect human rights and support democracy  that combat corruption and circumscribe freedoms.The mandate of my people is to support the moral force of which the people of Costa Rica are proud in international affairs also. We therefore denounce violence and work for peace. We denounce dictatorship and work for democracy. We denounce corruption and work for honesty. At the beginning of my presidency  I broke diplomatic relations with the Government of South Africa because we cannot sustain a dialogue with those who are capable of segregating their brothers because of the colour of their skin. We have withdrawn our Ambassador to Panama for as long as the path of liberty and democracy for all Panamanians is not respected.International politics must not fall prey to cynicism. To state publicly the intention to pursue a certain course of action and then privately to push in the opposite direction is often the destructive practice of strong and respected Governments as well as of small nations. This behaviour undermines the trust we wish to build and we must fight it  forcing international political forums to be accountable to the people.The will of the majority is beginning to prevail. Dialogue has regained its strength as a way to find solutions to the most difficult conflicts that confront us. The best proof of this is the United Nations  which in recent years has again begun to shine as a centre of international diplomacy and whose voice increasingly has the authority of the majority who break the chains which bound it to the extremes of power. Politics cannot consist of manipulating our fears  nor of the art of exaggerating our differences: we can respect it only when its purpose is to achieve harmony.Nothing could be more advantageous for mankind than reading history together. Let us attain justice by sharing the errors of the past and by working with confidence towards solutions within the framework of a new agenda for peace and development. The time has come to pay with interest for yesterday's errors and failures so that the sincere co-operation we need may arise  so that a common agenda may become a reality. There is an ecological debt that the developed world has toward future generations. Perhaps we should offset it with the financial debt of the third world. There is a social debt that is reflected in the poverty of millions. Perhaps we should offset it by opening and freeing the markets.Once world peace has been secured  a greater effort must be made to attain harmony in two respects; ecological balance and equitable development for nations and peoples. As with so many things in life  it is easier to share ideals than to reach them. We have different ways of determining how ecological imbalances and injustices have come about. Through dialogue  we can find agreement.Acid rain damages relations among the industrialized countries  but the lack of drinking water for millions of men  women and children is perhaps an even greater challenge. We are justifiably concerned about the possible consequences of the gradual global warming of the Earth. We know that one answer is massive reforestation of the tropical countries. The destruction of the ozone layer creates new risks for new forms of life on the planet. The technologies needed to face these challenges are based on patents so expensive they are un-affordable in our countries. We know that the extinction of different biological species must be stopped  and therefore certain practices that exist in our countries must be changed. We must also penalize the improper use of certain products by the developed countries. It is necessary to stop the loss of the forests  but soil erosion must not be neglected either.Each time we are disrespectful of nature  we are pointing a deadly weapon at our Children. No one must impose his solution on others  but together we can find a way that respects the goal that we pursue and is suited to what each of us can do. The economic crisis and the environmental threat are now part and parcel of the same problem. The economics of waste in the North and the economics of survival in the South are poor models for development. It is now time to construct a new harmony  to aim again at achieving well-being for every people and equitable development with justice and appropriate conservation of nature.When I came here for the first time  which seems so long ago now because of all the things that have happened since  I enthusiastically said that I proposed to come back here within four years  when my presidential term of office had ended  to tell you that together we had brought peace to Central America and that shanty-towns had become a thing of the past. Today I am here to tell you that shanty-towns still exist in my country. We have built more housing than ever before  much more than I promised in my electoral campaign. We have launched a crusade that no Government will ever be able to reverse in the future. But the shanty-towns still exist  as does the child abandoned in the street. We have extended peace  but the threat of war persists  and brothers are still killing each other in the corners of my little America.There is no end to the struggle for justice and peace. It does not know a single day of rest. Some short-sighted people believe that the efforts to eliminate the slums in my country could have been more effective if we had not fought for peace. I thank God and Costa Rica that we never fell into that selfish way of thinking. My people can look back at the history of the last few years with their heads held high.As I said to you at the beginning of my statement  I came to thank you because the successes we have attained would not have been possible without your help. You are giving a human face to a world that until recently had no face and knew no mercy. I leave with the joy of knowing that peace is closer at hand and with the confidence of knowing that the slums which still darken the horizon in my country will disappear. I will always continue to he a Costa Rican at the service of these causes and your ally in these struggles the world over."
"35",1695,"CSK",44,1989,"ï»¿May I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly and express my conviction that under your guidance the current deliberations of the General Assembly will bring fruitful results.In our contradictory and complex world hope for peaceful restructuring of relations between States  for their democratisation  demilitarisation and humanization has grown ever stronger in recent times. We would like to believe that  after decades encumbered by prejudice  tension aid confrontation  a new period is emerging during which contentious problems will be solved exclusively by political means  by a dialogue in the interests of the further strengthening of co-operation and understanding between nations.On the path to this better world the united Nations has its unique place. We value its active participation in the positive changes in present-day developments as  ell as the important role played in this regard by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar.The experience of the last two years has shown how necessary it is to develop the functions of the united Nations in the prevention of international disputes aid crises. The strengthening of this preventive role of the Organization constitutes a realistic way to a further increase in its effectiveness in the preservation of peace and security. The significant and inspiring proposals which could be heard in this context in Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev's statement here last year are no less topical new than they were then. We support them and contribute to their implementation.In the present nuclear and space age it is necessary more than ever before to build international relations on deeply moral and ethical principles. In the year of the bicentennial of the great French revolution  whose heritage was followed up and significantly enriched by the great October socialist revolution in Russia  we recall not only the ideals of the enlightenment but also the humanistic message of the followers of the great achievement of the liberation of man - the message of those who could see in the horizon of tomorrow an international community where the simple laws of morality and justice by which mutual relations among people were to be guided would become the highest laws applying to nations.Certain significant aspects of present-day developments encourage us to hope that these noble ideas will become a reality. It has been possible to improve the international climate and diminish the risk of a nuclear war. ""today we see traditional mistrust and suspicion receding. The first concrete results have been achieved in the field of nuclear disarmament. There is an ever-greater understanding of the need to proceed jointly with the solution of crucial global problems facing mankind. New impetus in this regard has been provided by the recent Soviet Union-United States talks in Wyoming. There has been an increase in the role of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The conclusions of its Ninth Conference  in Belgrade  are an important contribution to the peaceful development of international relations. If human civilization is to survive in the conditions of the threat of nuclear catastrophe  and given the ever-greater interconnection and mutual dependence of States regardless of their political systems  all countries must take new attitudes and non-traditional approaches stemming from the priority of universal human values and from the philosophy of the new political thinking.We are optimists? yet we look upon the international situation realistically. It remains complicated. Not all are already capable now of accepting the notion of a world free from nuclear weapons and of violence. Confrontational approaches still persist  efforts are still being made to justify the doctrine of nuclear deterrence  and elements of pressure and attempts to teach lessons to others still linger on.Political  military  economic  environmental and humanitarian problems are so interrelated today that we can solve them only by acting jointly and in a comprehensive way. Therefore  Czechoslovakia has co-sponsored the initiative of the socialist countries aimed at the achievement of a comprehensive approach to the issues of international peace and security. Only common security serves the interests of all; Disarmament  development and the environment are becoming its organic components. It is strengthened by comprehensive co-operation between States in the political sphere  in the economy  in culture  science and technology  as well as in the development of human contacts and in the field of human rights. At the same time  we proceed from the premise of strict observance of the united Nations Charter  of the Helsinki Final Act and of other international norms.At the very inception of the united Nations there was imprinted on its banner a belief in the need to build a world order on the firm foundations of legality and justice. The process of codification and progressive development of international law over the past four decades has been unprecedented in history. However  has it really become an effective tool for regulating the behaviour of States and relations among them? A huge and daunting challenge still faces us - the need to strengthen the role of international law and develop the international machinery for its implementation.The attainment of these goals could be significantly facilitated by the decade of international law proposed by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. The broader use of the functions of the International Court of Justice is also a significant factor. We intend to add further to the almost 20 multilateral treaties on which Czechoslovakia has already accepted the jurisdiction of the Court. Czechoslovakia was one of the first victims of the expansionism of German fascism that unleashed the Second World War 50 years ago. We have drawn a lesson of the greatest importance from this most terrible tragedy in human history. Any attempt to change the post-war order on the European continent or to call into question the existing political and territorial realities would be incompatible with the Helsinki Final Act and would threaten dangerous consequences for peace and stability in Europe  end not only in Europe. Only by our combined efforts can we prevent a recurrence of the horrors of war.The European continent has an important role to play in efforts towards a peaceful world order. It is in that part of the world that the two largest military aid political groupings and two of the most important integrating in ions are situated. Developments there are moving towards the strengthening of the favourable trends in international relations. The Vienna final document  the establishment of relations between the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the European Economic Community  the negotiations on conventional forces and on confidence-building measures  the dialogue in the framework of the humanitarian dimension of the Helsinki process - all demonstrate the great opportunities for co-operation among the European States. The great Czech humanist Jan Amos Comenius  the 400th anniversary of whose birth will be commemorated in 1992  wrote; ""The best proof of human grandeur is the work of man's hands  of man's brain. As soon as this is understood by the leaders of nations  there will be no more wars"". We feel sure that the time for this understanding has already come. We believe that the inhabitants of our old continent will be able to make of it a common home based on a diversity of socio-economic systems and on respect for existing territorial and political realities and for sovereignty and the right of each nation freely to decide its own destiny.Such a development requires  first of all  a reduction of conventional armed forces from the Atlantic to the Urals; the gradual elimination of weapons of mass destruction; the strengthening of the political functions of the Warsaw Treaty aid the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)   and enhancement of general trust and confidence an the continent. This is clearly expressed in the conclusions adapted earlier this year at the session of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty in Bucharest.We seek to ensure that the military potential of the countries members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) is commensurate with the need of reasonable sufficiency and that their armed forces have an exclusively defensive nature. The proposals of the Warsaw Treaty and 'die reciprocal steps taken by the NATO States are a suitable basis for further negotiations in Vienna. We believe that if the will is there on both sides  an initial agreement could be signed at the highest level as early as next year.There is an urgent need for the opening of separate talks an tactical nuclear weapons. This should involve a phased solution in which it would be the goal  in the first phase of the talks  to reach an agreement on redactions to equal  collective limits on both sides. In this context  we would recall the proposal put forward in April 1987 by the Governments of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic aid the German Democratic Republic to create a nuclear-weapon-free corridor in central Europe. Like the other Warsaw Treaty States  we have also adopted extensive unilateral measures to reduce the manpower of combat units by 12 000 men  end we are taking out of service and dismantling 850 tanks  165 armoured personnel carriers and 51 military aircraft. This year we are reducing the production of combat equipment by 16 per cent. Next year the reduction will already have readied 25 per cent* and this process will continue. We are cutting defence expenditure in 1989-1990 by 15 per cent. We are also contemplating reducing the length of effective military service.In the interests of enhancing confidence and security  we are ready to expand the Stockholm accords ad adapt  on a mutual basis  a new generation of information  observation and limitation measures applying to all branches of the armed forces. Our concrete contribution towards a more secure and peaceful world and construction of a comma European home is the initiative to create a zone of confidence  co-operation and good-neighbourly relations along the line of contact between the Warsaw Treaty ad NATO  put forward by the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia  Milos Jakes. We wish to support the new trends in relations between the two military-political groupings and to seek out and utilize everything that unites us.In the political sphere  we propose a regular ad all-road dialogue between parliaments  Governments  political parties  social organizations ad n on-governmental institutions. We are also working towards the adoption of measures designed further to strengthen confidence beyond the framework of the Stockholm document  for example by ""diluting"" the contingents of forces deployed in the proposed zone. We also wish to promote the dynamic development of economic relations ad the creation of the prerequisites for new forms of co-operation. We are also paying a great deal of attention to the ecological part of the initiative. We strive for the creation of a system ad mechanism for multilateral co-operation in mutual assistance to preserve the quality of the air  water and natural riches we share with our neighbours. In the humanitarian sphere also  we wish to create favourable conditions for mutual knowledge and understanding.It is true that this proposal is addressed not only to the countries along the line of contact between the two groupings. The participation of other States  including the neutral States  could add to its significance. Thus  there is an opportunity to make headway in shaping qualitatively new relations  thus contributing to a further improvement of the atmosphere in Europe.In our policy  we proceed from the assumption that disarmament is one of the priority tasks of the present epoch. After the achievement of the treaty between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America on the Elimination of Their Intermediate -Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  in which Czechoslovakia also played its part  the world breathed a sigh of relief. However  a large number of resolute steps still retrain to be taken to make the disarmament process irreversible. Above all  the negotiations on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic offensive weapons must be successfully completed. We also assume that the anti-ballistic missile Treaty of 1972 must be complied with as signed.The progress made in the talks between the Soviet Union end the united States on the limitation and halting of nuclear-weapon testing  about which we were informed from this rostrum  creates good conditions for resolving this key issue. We appreciate the readiness of the USSR to resume its moratorium on nuclear-weapon testing  and hope that the United States will respond positively. The need remains imperative to consolidate the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That goal would be promoted by the halting and eventual prohibition of the production of fissionable materials for armament purposes  as well as by the prevention of the spread of combat missile technology. A strengthening of the regime of this Treaty would be significantly facilitated by observance of the existing nuclear-free zones and by the establishment of new such zones. Reliable protection of civilian nuclear facilities from attack remains an important task.Special attention should be focused on the achievement of a convention on a complete and general prohibition of chemical weapons and on the elimination of the stockpiles of such weapons  as called for by the Paris Conference held this year and by the recent Canberra negotiations. We welcome the fact that the Soviet Union and the United States made proposals from this podium a few days ago  the implementation of which would signal an important move towards the elimination of those barbarous weapons.This year  Czechoslovakia has made increased efforts in pursuit of that goal  as further manifested by the corresponding statement of the Czechoslovak Government of last January. We have conducted a national experiment on the verification of the non-production of chemical weapons in the Czechoslovak civilian industry  we have also prepared an international stage for that experiment. We have reaffirmed that our country does not possess chemical weapons and that no such weapons are deployed in its territory  and we have made public the necessary data on our chemical industry in August. Our proposals of 1985 to 1988 for the establishment of a chemical-weapon-free zone in Central Europe  which could facilitate in its own way the conclusion of a global convention  retain their significance.He also advocate speedy negotiations on the prevention of an arms race in outer space and on the programme of practical actions for the peaceful uses of outer space. The time has undeniably come to work out an international system of verification of the non- stationing of weapons in outer space and to set up a world space-monitoring agency.He are in favour of a concrete consideration of the ""open skies"" proposal  which we regard as one way to further develop confidence- and security-building measures. If supplemented with open lands  open seas and open space  the proposal could lead to the creation of a global system of comprehensive openness.One of the first positive results of the process of genuine disarmament is also the gradual conversion of a portion of military production to civilian purposes. As for us  we have worked out a national plan for the utilization of the capacities released from the production of combat equipment. We support the idea that this matter should become a subject of international consultations  including in the united Nations.The peaceful settlement of disputes by political means on a just basis is an essential condition for safeguarding peace  security and fruitful co-operation in the world. We believe that further progress can be made on the elimination of long-standing hotbeds of tension. Experience has shown that the united Nations can make a significant contribution in that regard.Through the signing of agreements in New York last December  real prerequisites were created for a solution to the conflict in southern Africa. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic has also delegated its observers to the united Nations Angola Verification Mission corps in Angola and to the united Nations Transition Assistance Group peace force in Namibia. In that way we have also demonstrated our full support for Namibia's transition to independence. The international community's pressure on South Africa must not abate. An appropriate added opportunity for that will certainly be provided by the special session of the General Assembly scheduled for December. Apartheid must be eradicated.We appreciate the part played so far by the United Nations in mediating the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan. However  it is necessary of course that the other provisions of those Agreements also be implemented after the withdrawal of Soviet troops  and that favourable conditions be thus created for a political solution of the situation and for a policy of national reconciliation. The United Nations should play an active role here. We fully support the proposals of the Afghan Government aimed at securing those objectives.The complex situation in the Middle East requires the speedy convening of an international conference under United Nations auspices. That need has also been confirmed by the course of the general debate to date. The key to a solution of the conflict lies in the recognition of a balance of interests  respect for the legitimate rights of all participants and for their free choice of development. The uprising in the occupied territories is graphic proof of the will of the Palestinian people  which can no longer be ignored. The realistic policies espoused by the Palestine Liberation Organization have our broad support.We express our hope that a final  peaceful aid just solution to the Iran-Iraq conflict will be found.An important step towards a settlement of the Cambodian question is the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces. We support the policy of national reconciliation  which will create the basis for an independent  neutral and non-aligned Cambodia. A resumption of the negotiations in Paris on a peaceful future for that country should be instrumental.We fully support the proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to open a constructive North-South dialogue to strengthen understanding and peace in the Korean Peninsula.We welcome the initiatives of the five Central American countries aimed at a peaceful solution of the situation in that area. We wish to commend in particular the constructive policy of the Government of Nicaragua. We view the full implementation of the Tela agreements and the engagement of the United Nations as a path to the settlement of the problem.A further expression of Czechoslovakia's active support of a peaceful solution of the question of Cyprus by negotiation between the two communities was provided by the meeting of the principle representatives of eight Cypriot political parties in Prague in May. We welcome the negotiations between the countries of the Horn of Africa as well as Ethiopia's new initiative concerning the peaceful development of that country.We have embarked upon the path of profound social transformations in my country. We are implementing the restructuring end democratisation of all walks of life in our society  with the aim of further strengthening and improving socialism and of taking full advantage of its humanistic potential. In that process  we are drawing on the experience of the USSR and other socialist countries. We have set ourselves the demanding task of restructuring society in all its complexity without damaging social and economic stability.What we are aiming at is a truly just  economically efficient society with its economy based on advanced science and technology  a society with a high standard of living  firm social securities  and a deeply democratic political system enabling all citizens to develop their individual capabilities in harmony with the interests of society. We assume that socialism is based on the vigorous  creative activity of people. The restructuring builds on what we have achieved in the past  on the progressive and democratic traditions of the people of our country. It rests on our bonds of alliance end seeks to strengthen confidence aid co-operation  not only with our neighbours but also with other States.The changes taking place in the socialist countries are generating favourable conditions for an increase in international co-operation to a qualitatively new level. That fully applies  too  to international economic relations  the further development of which should be founded on a consistently equal platform  on the principles of non-discrimination aid mutual advantage.The present state of affairs is far from positive. Many serious problems exist in the world economy  and some of them are worsening. Imbalances and uncertainty about future development persist. There is an ever-widening gap between advanced and developing States. The indebtedness of the developing world is now reaching a critical point.The United Nations can be of significant help in alleviating and solving those crucial problems. The favourable political climate should be concretely reflected in international economic relations also. Here  an important role will be played by the special session of the General Assembly  to be held in April of next year  as well as by the United Nations international development strategy for the coming decade. For our part  we are prepared to take all necessary steps.International economic relations and scientific and technological co-operation can be enhanced only if all forms of pressure  exploitation aid discrimination are removed. That is the path towards greater security in such relations. The strengthening of the functions of the United Nations so that it might be possible to foresee and prevent emergency situations in world economic development would greatly facilitate that.We shall continue to pay constant attention to economic relations with developing countries on the basis of equality and mutual advantage. With regard to our aid to those countries  it exceeds 1 per cent of our national income.One of the most pressing global problems in today's world is the protection of the environment. Nature and human wisdom must be in harmony. That can be achieved only through the broadest possible joint action by all. We are determined to take an active part in those endeavours on the world  regional and sub-regional levels.Indeed  at the forty-third session of the General Assembly we submitted  together with the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic  a draft resolution in the field of protection of the environment. The proposal we have prepared for submission at this session  which deals with strengthening co-operation in the fields of monitoring  evaluating and anticipating dangers to the environment end with assistance in case of emergencies  incorporates the results of consultations held with many countries. It is based on the fact that there is a growing awareness of the real risk of unpredictable environmental situations that may not oily jeopardize the security of individual countries but also threaten the very existence of mankind. The preparation of a set of principles to govern the ecological behaviour of States should be an important contribution of the second United Nations conference on environment and development  to be held in 1992. We fully support the convening of that conference.The solution of environmental questions is the aim of the proposal made by the Czechoslovak Prime Minister  Ladislav Adamec. On that basis a conference was held at Prague this year of Government representatives responsible for environmental questions in Czechoslovakia and in all six neighbouring countries. It was also attended by representatives of the European Community  the Economic Commission for Europe end the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. In the memorandum adopted principles were laid down for action to be taken to strengthen international co-operation  which the participants in the conference intend to specify further. In due course we should like to hold a meeting in our capital city of the Prime Ministers of the participating countries. We also expect the forthcoming Sofia meeting on protection of the environment to achieve concrete results and help develop sorely needed co-operation in Europe.In recent years joint efforts have made it possible to take a number of concrete steps away from confrontation and towards dialogue in the extensive sphere of humanitarian questions and human rights. The growing United Nations role in this connection is also confirmed by the draft convention on the rights of the child  which is now being prepared. The current session of the General assembly should bring that important initiative of the Polish People's Republic to a successful conclusion.The position and place of man in society are increasingly becoming the central focus of world attention. The pan-Europe process has introduced a new notion - the human dimension - into international practice. It is our view that its implementation must gradually be given a universal character.The struggle against drugs and narcotics is becoming critical  and we are prepared to contribute actively to it.Within the framework of adopting practical and effective measures to prevent international terrorism  Czechoslovakia  together with Great Britain  has put forward an initiative in the United Nations and in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to prepare an international convention on the prevention of misuse of plastic explosives for terrorist purposes. We are pleased with the support given that idea by the Security Council  the Council of ICAO and many member States this year. We are ready to work together with all countries towards the earliest possible achievement of concrete results.We are all faced with a need to solve difficult problems. Many processes that existed only on a national level not so long ago now have an international scope. They influence the life of each individual country and of the entire international community. If we can control those processes properly we can ensure  in real terms  not only the survival but also the prosperity of mankind. The united Nations plays an irreplaceable role in stimulating and co-ordinating those efforts. We must grasp the chance being offered us by the positive changes that are taking place in today's world and by the growing understanding of the human relationship.We are convinced that the united Nations will fulfil its historic mission. In order for it to do so  however  there must be business-like and constructive dialogue aid  above all  political will on the part of Member States to make active use of all the opportunities the Organization offers. Let us therefore avoid confrontation and fruitless disputes here. Let us be even more consistent in identifying the things that link us together rather than the things that divide us. Let us concentrate on the solution of problems affecting the life and well-being of all. Just as States now possess the means of mutual extermination  so too do they have available to them sufficient potential to realize the universally valid ideas of peace  understanding and co-operation.Czechoslovakia is ready to exert every effort so that we may be able  all together  to rise to this unique opportunity for the benefit of all mankind."
"36",1718,"CUB",44,1989,"ï»¿May I first  on behalf of the people and Government of the Republic of Cuba and on my own behalf  express our warmest congratulations to Major General Joseph N. Garba  outstanding son of the brotherly people of Nigeria  on his election to preside over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. At the outset  too  we wish to express our appreciation of Mr. Dante Caputo  a remarkable Latin American political figure and statesman  who performed brilliantly as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. During that session we welcomed with satisfaction and hope the disarmament agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States  which undoubtedly opened the way for a relaxation of tension  a reversal of the arms race and the removal of the threat of war. We cannot overlook the influence of the Soviet union's policy of peace on that.Hope of peace is still uncertain  for those are just initial steps  yet to be consolidated. The nuclear arsenal remains virtually intact. The United States and some of its allies plan to modernize theirs  and have declared that the strategy of North Atlantic Treaty Organization should be maintained. The United States military budget is not being reduced. Therefore  we should not deceive ourselves or harbour illusions that tensions have disappeared from the international arena. A difficult road lies ahead. Yet  there are some grounds for hope  unless the Government of the United States itself to be lured by the dangerous and cherished idea that socialism can be brought down from within  and adopts a policy of arrogance and domination.Cuba strongly supports a policy of peace  and will do everything it can contribute to making this process  which is all-important for mankind  irreversible. However. the fundamental idea prevailing in the United States position is that peace among the big Powers  detente between the blocs  should allow the United States to pursue its policy of pressure and threat against revolutionary  Progressive and independent countries of the third world.Therefore peace should not be seen exclusively in the context of the level of confrontation between the big Powers. The peace that we non-aligned developing countries - which do not possess nuclear weapons but which have the great strength of our moral weapons - seek  the global. honourable  just and lasting peace we are a11 looking forward to  requires that underdeveloped nations also benefit from the climate of detente. As the first Vice-President of the Council of state and of the Council of Ministers of  Ministers  General of the Army Raul Castro stated at the  Ninth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries: ""The security and peace of the rich are not the security and peace for which the poor nations struggle. We want peace with sovereignty  independence  dignity  Justice and development. We want a truly universal Peace without interference or aggression."" We cannot conceive  much less accept  that while talks and negotiations agreements that contribute to disarmament  international peace and security  the United states continues at the same time to apply its hostile policies and actions against independent nations in different parts of the world. The situation prevailing in Panama today is the clearest example of the arrogance with which the empire views peace with small states  - undoubtedly a peace  with sharp claws.  Cuba has been instantly reaffirming  the continued provocations and campaigns orchestrated  day and night against Panama  more than against an individual or an event  are designed to create an atmosphere conducive to a United States breach of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty under which Panama will gain full sovereignty over the Canal and which requires the dismantling of United States military bases in the Canal Zone by the end of this century.The Ninth Summit Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries expressed its concern over the increase of United States troops in Panama and at continued military manoeuvres on Panamanian territory  which create a situation of tension that could lead to serious conflict. The Heads of State or Government reaffirmed in Belgrade their solidarity with the people of Panama in their struggle to consolidate the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country. They demanded full observance of the letter and spirit of the Panama Canal Treaties of 1977 and rejected any action that might constitute a violation or disregard the validity of the treaties and called upon the United States to refrain from adopting any measure or action that could prevent their full implementation. They deplored the coercive economic measures imposed against the Republic of Panama and demanded their immediate termination. The international community's solidarity with the heroic people of Panama is necessary to prevent the threat that now looms over that country from becoming a reality. There is another situation of tension in our region that has not yet been resolved. The Central American conflicts  which has lasted for years  has seen an important development in the Tela Agreements  crowning efforts that reflect the political will of Latin American peoples and Governments. We hope that such serious negotiating efforts will counter the United States Government's policy of interference which - after years of sustained heavy financial backing of the Somoza bands operating against Nicaragua whose disbanding has now been legally decided - is now promoting and appropriating funds for the Nicaraguan opposition with a view to sabotaging the country's legitimate win and producing an electoral victory favourable to its own interests.We welcome the calm and firm attitude of the Sandinista Government in the search for a just and honourable solution to a conflict that has taken the lives of many of Nicaragua's best youth  fallen in defence of their national sovereignty and independence. The search for a politically negotiated solution in El Salvador is also part of the negotiating process in Central America. Acceptance of the Tela Agreements by both parties to the conflict allows us to harbour hopes for the honourable solution sought by a people which have suffered the horrors of a terrible repression that has taken thousands of lives and inspired Salvadorean patriots to Put up a formidable fight  we support the just stand of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLM) and the Democratic Revolutionary Front (FDR)  which have once again shown their readiness to hold negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue.We express our solidarity with the just demand of the people and Government of Argentina to recover their sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands. we also support Bolivia's call for a direct and useful outlet to the sea.The Iran-Iraq conflict  which has for years kept these two non-aligned countries immersed in a bloody war that should never have begun  is now moving towards negotiation. Hostilities have ceased  but certain elements contained in security Council resolution 596 (1987) have yet to be Implemented before the achievement of a just and stable peace is possible. The imperialist presence in the Gulf  .here naval forces pose a threat to the security and independence of States in the region  does not contribute to attaining the much needed permanent peace. In South West Asia the signing of the Geneva Agreements has not prevented one of the parties  with the support and assistance of the United States Government  from continuing its attempts to impose a military solution contrary to the letter and spirit of the Geneva Agreements. Cuba supports the national reconciliation policy being pursued by the Government of the Republic of Afghanistan in a flexible and persistent fashion. The completion of Vietnamese troop withdrawals from Cambodia constitutes an important contribution to the political solution of the Cambodian conflict. Regrettably  however  the recent meeting in Paris did not bring about immediate results.The situation in the Middle East is worsening and it has not yet been possible to get all the parties involved to agree to convening and holding an international Peace conference  which is in our view a viable way to resolve the conflict  with the participation of all parties concerned on an equal footing  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (H.0). the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Our Government expresses its unrestricted support for their right to independence and a national State. The intifidah. the heroic uprising of the Palestinian people against the ruthlessness of Zionism  deserves the respect and recognition of the entire international community. Cuba reiterates its condemnation of the actions of Israel and the united States  its strategic ally  and expresses the conviction that the solution to the conflict in the Middle East must necessarily entail a solution to the question of Palestine.We support the just cause of the Lebanese people in their struggle for national unity and territory integrity. We reiterate our support for the legitimate rights of the Cypriot people to preserve their national unity  independence  sovereignty and non-aligned character. We consider the convening of an international conference on Cyprus under the auspices of the United Nations to be a positive initiative.we wish to express our support for the just policy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at' the peaceful reunification of their country and the total withdrawal of United States occupation troops from the south of the peninsula. We are confident that we will soon be able to welcome a delegation from a unified Korea to the United Nations.We support the establishment of an independent and sovereign Sahraoui State and the withdrawal of the Moroccan administration and troops from the territory of Western Sahara.We reiterate our support for Madagascar's recovery of its rights over the Malvinas Islands - Glorieuses  Juan de Neva  Europa and Bassas da India - as well as for the aspirations of the Comoros Islands to recover their sovereignty over Mayotte. Progress in the situation in southern Africa has been significant since December last  when the United Nations became the stage for the signing of the Tripartite Agreements that preceded the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). There is no doubt that the long and complex negotiating process which resulted in the signing of the Tripartite Accords is proof that serious negotiations can be held while the legitimate interests of all parties are respected. As our President  Comrade Fidel Castro  has pointed out  Cuba negotiated seriously and is seriously fulfilling its commitments. By 22 September 1989  a total of 20 666 combatants had returned victorious to our homeland  in compliance with the agreed timetable  which was duly monitored by the united Nations verification team.In conformity with the decision of the Ninth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries held recently in Belgrade  the united Nations has the lofty and delicate responsibility of monitoring the implementation of the provisions of resolution 435 (1978) and of ensuring that the Namibian people and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  its legitimate representative  can express themselves  without obstacles of any type  in the free and sovereign elections scheduled for next November. Cuba joins the non-aligned countries and allhonourable peoples the world over in demanding an immediate end to all interference in Namibia by forces of the colonial Power.At their Ninth Summit Conference the non-aligned countries raised their voice to denounce the intransigence of the apartheid racist regime  as manifest in its continued internal repression. The Conference pointed out that apartheid cannot be reformed  that it must be eliminated through the complete eradication of its criminal system. The Conference also called on the United Nations to adopt effective measures in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Cuba fully endorses these Just demands of the Non-Aliped Movement.All necessary measures must be taken to avoid fraud in the forthcoming elections. Threats and acts of aggression against the Namibian people must come to end. The Koevoet racist military forces  which are part of the Namibian police  must be disbanded immediately  voters should cast their votes in the places .here they are registered. Secret ballots must be respected. Illiterate voters should  be able to have the assistance of persons of their choice   and ballots should be counted in the districts  and not brought to the capital.The Assembly should have full powers and not be subordinated to the administrator. as the. representative of the South African racist regime wishes  when deciding on the state to be taken towards independence.We note with satisfaction that the climate of aggression and threats from outside against Ethiopia is beginning to be disposed. As a result  the circumstances which  more than 10 years ago - when a request was made by the Ethiopian Government - made the presence of Cuban internationalist contents necessary to assist Ethiopia's forces in repelling outside aggression  have come to an end. Thus the Cuban combatants who comprised small contingent in Ethiopia returned home this September. In this manner Cuba has once again proven its ability to express its solidarity with other peoples and at the. same time contribute to international peace.With the independence of Namibia and its entry into the international arena and the community of nations  the struggle against colonialism will have achieved a great victory. However  we should not feel satisfied  more than 20 territories  with a potation of several million  still live under colonial domination. The people of Puerto Rico remain under a foreign boot  after almost 100 years of United States military occupation. It is well known that the so-called Plebiscite with which the United States Administration intends to determine the Territory's future is an attempt to incorporate Puerto Rico  as a new state  in the Union.Because of this  the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization this year not only reaffirmed the right of the Boricuan people to self-determination and independence  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV)  but also expressed its hope  and that of the ""international community  that  in any consultation  the people of Puerto Rico would be able to exercise  without any hindrance  its right to self-determination and independence  with expressed recognition of their sovereignty and full political equality  in line with the provisions of resolution 1514 (XV). Cuba  together with the other non-aligned countries  considers that efforts must be made to put an end to all existing colonial situations by the turn of the century.The problems deriving from the sustained growth of the drug consumer market - particularly in the United States - and the resulting incentive to production and trafficking have become increasingly serious. We must face this situation resolutely. The struggle against drug production and trafficking must go side by side with the struggle against consumption  against the market which  in the United States alone  produces annual profits exceeding $150 billion. Cuba is  as always  prepared to play its corresponding role in that battle.One issue that deserves our immediate attention is the threat to global security resulting from the international economic situation. We reiterate that  while the steps being taken in the field of disarmament and towards the creation of a climate of detente in the solution of some conflicts  as well as in the relations between the great Powers  are encouraging  such progress has not led to solutions to the problems of underdevelopment or the economic crisis afflicting the third world. He will not advance towards a real system of security so long as the already huge gap between the developed countries and the underdeveloped part of the world - which is suffering from an increasingly critical situation of backwardness  poverty and underdevelopment - continues to grow. These issues must be reconsidered  and a lasting solution found  if we wish to live in a world of true peace and social stability.The encouraging picture painted by the economic performance of the industrialised nations during 1988 is very different indeed from the situation of crisis prevailing in the economies of the developing countries. United Nations studies themselves indicate that the average per capita income of industrialized countries is 50 times higher than that of the least developed countries  and that the mere annual growth of the wealthiest countries amounts almost to the total annual per capita income of the poorest nations  which is approximately 3300.What kind of peace can we talk about in such a situation of seemingly unsolvable imbalances  where the poor increase the opulence of the wealthy? If peace is not linked to development  then poverty  inequality and violence will not disappear.The phenomena which continue to characterize international economic relations  perpetuating this unjust situation  which are particularly evident in third-world nations with respect to unpayable external debt  are well known: protectionism? difficult access to markets for the main products of the developing countries; deterioration in the terms of trade? dumping; reduced financial flews? high interest rates? coercive economic measures? international monetary and financial instability? and external debt. All of this has resulted  in the recent past  in a net transfer of resources from the developing countries to the industrialized nations  causing not only continued plundering that prevents growth and development but also a new form of economic colonialism. Suffice it to mention  as an example  that the transfer of resources from Latin American countries to their creditors  in recent years alone  amounts to $179 billion. This represents 4 par cent of their annual gross domestic product - a figure that exceeds  by far  Germany's forced external net transfer of resources after its defeat in the First World War.Many have focused their attention on the specific problem of external debt. But consistent steps towards true solutions have not yet been taken. Proposed solutions  coming mostly from creditors and based on case-by-case rescheduling  have only worsened the economic situation of debtor countries  although they have succeeded in their main objective of keeping creditor banks from enduring imminent heavy losses. Debtor countries  however  are growing nearer to insolvency  and their stagnation is prolonged with economic and social costs that have led to serious political disturbances and claimed hundreds and hundreds of human lives.Proposals made within and outside the United Nations  based on a reduction of the amount of the debt  involve recognition that the debt is unpayable. The experience of all these years only confirms that the real solution to the debt problem involves the total elimination of the debt and the establishment of a new international economic order which would do away with the causes of today's grim Picture. Existing proposals would be a palliative only if reductions reached substantial levels  which Latin American Economic System experts have fixed at no less than 50 per cent  if ceilings are set for interest rates  and if a generalframework for implementation were established including all debtors without exception.As long as we attempt to resolve the problem on a case-by-case basis we shall continue to fail. We would support United Nations efforts to bring about a real political dialogue between debtor and creditor countries.The special session of the General Assembly to be held in the spring of 1990 and its preparatory process will give us an opportunity to reassess the challenges posed by this ongoing crisis of development in the face of the world's new economic and social realities. We hope the special session will promote frank and constructive dialogue with the understanding that unless swift and realistic solutions are promoted the problems new affecting vast regions of the world will in the future threaten the countries of the North with social and political instability.Of course  the international development strategy for the 1990s will have to be realistic and provide for concrete policy measures with defined goals and objectives. But in particular it will require the readiness of industrialized countries to contribute to efforts by developing countries.Protection of the environment is a concept that must be clearly defined because of its close relation to problems of development  the protection of natural resources  international economic relations  extreme poverty and the sovereignty of States  it is a matter of concern to all nations  a matter with respect to which imperialist actions bear a great responsibility  owing to the transfer to our countries of polluting industries by capitalist developed countries irrespective of the diversity of forms the problem takes in different areas. The problem must therefore be examined and measures chosen with the participation of all States  not a restricted or select group. Iâ particular  its close links to problems of development must be very clear  since underdevelopment is the main threat to the third world. Underdevelopment stems from our colonial past  which also involved  among other acts of aggression  the devastation of our forests and caused irreparable damage to our environment. Increasingly  the United Nations is becoming the optimal forum for contributing to the solution of the numerous problems we are facing. Maximum co-operation by all Member States is necessary to make its action more effective. The unique role played by the Secretary-General through his efforts to eradicate hotbeds of conflict has gained recognition by the international community  thus strengthening the Organization's potential to mediate and give political negotiating coverage to parties that had in the past been engaged on the battlefield. He should pursue those endeavours wherever conditions allow in the search for compromise and the honourable peace demanded by our peoples.The growing role of the third world in the United Nations may be seen in the context of that positive performance. There is no doubt that the United Nations represents the development of our planet since the end of the Second World War - from the establishment of the Organization to the present day. Today's United Nations is not and cannot be the United Nations of 1945. We must therefore embark on a sustained process of democratising its machinery in keeping with the interests of all member States. Cuba has already stated its position on this subject  which is of interest to the entire international community.The Bush Administration has clearly begin to take steps with respect to Cuba that would make it the eighth United States Administration not wishing to establish a climate of peace and good-neighbourliness and persisting in hostile and aggressive action against us.Cuba knows it is not alone in the struggle to defend its rights  its independence and its sovereignty. We appreciate the numerous expressions of solidarity we have received. We wish in particular to refer to the decision adopted by Heads of State or Government of non-aligned countries at the recent ninth summit conference held in Belgrade. They condemned the continued threats of aggression against Cuba  the violation of its air-space and territorial waters and the blockade imposed against Cuba in the areas of finance  credit and trade  along with radio broadcasts from the United States and the decision to begin television broadcasts of a destabilizing nature  in violation of international law and  particularly  the 1982 Nairobi Convention.We have warned the United States of the consequences of beginning such broadcasts  it will bear full responsibility. Cuba will not tolerate such session in silence. We shall respond - and I wish expressly to reaffirm that from this rostrum. Heads of state or Government of the Bon-Aligned Movement also reiterated their support and solidarity with respect to Cuba's Just demand for the return of the territory illegally occupied by the United states at its Guantanamo naval base. Cuba will never forget those decisions  which should be taken into account by the united states Administration as it formulates its regional policies.The anti-Cuban attitude of United States arch-reactionary circles on the Potomac increases the political blindness of the top leadership of that country in its vain attempt to make the Cuban revolution yield  this has reached the point -here strategic aircraft in combat formation have been sent to our country simulating a massive air strike  as took place on 20 May last  while United states submarines approached our shores with unknown objectives  which  could have caused serious and delicate incidents. Like all other peace-loving nations that are firmly confuted to achieving the social and economic development demanded by their peoples  Cuba shares the great wish to devote all its resources to the noble goal of develop.Cuba - the Cuban revolution - has been a reality for more than three decades  and it constantly renews its energies and strengths. Long ago. our people decided to sever the chains of bondage to metropolis countries and neo-colonialism  and freely chose the economic  political and social system It wanted. Therefore  our readiness to maintain peaceful relations of co-operation and friendship with any country - and the United States ought to remember this - is based primarily on this principle; Cuba must be treated for what it is  an independent state and a sovereign socialist nation."
"37",1764,"CYP",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like first of all to offer you. Sir  my warm congratulations on taking up the presidency of the General assembly and to express my deep thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Dante Caputo  for his work. I should like also to express our esteem and appreciation for the excellent work of the Secretary-General - whose thoughtful and informative report we have read with great interest - in conducting the affairs and promoting the goals of the United Nations.When we gathered at the United Nations this time last year we all spoke with hope of the dawning of a new  more peaceful epoch in international affairs. Political developments of momentous significance in the intervening 12 months have confirmed our hopes of a new era. At the same time  we have become aware of the many challenges raised by this era  which must be met effectively before our positive expectations and aspirations can be fully realized.Relations between the two major super-Powers - the bellwether for a general amelioration of the international political climate - have continued to improve at a quickening pace  surpassing our expectations. The momentous importance of the shift from confrontation to co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union can hardly be overestimated. As a result of the opportunity for dialogue on an expanded agenda created by this new positive climate  there is today a marked overall improvement in East-West relations. A long list of disarmament accords  which a few years ago seemed unattainable  have been concluded  while the prospects for the ongoing East-West talks on conventional force reductions  chemical weapons and strategic offensive weapons have been greatly enhanced  particularly following this month's successful meeting in Wyoming between Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze and Mr . James Baker.We are encouraged by the proposal made by President George Bush at the General Assembly for cuts of at least 80 per cent in the super-Power chemical-weapons arsenals  with the aim of a total ban on such weapons within 10 years of the signing of a multilateral chemical-weapons treaty  and by the very positive response of the Soviet Union.Reflecting the shift from confrontation to co-operation in super-Power relations  a number of conflicts at diverse points on the globe are now on the path to peaceful resolution.Namibia is now firmly launched on the road to independence. The personal involvement of the Secretary-General has contributed decisively to the Namibia independence process  which represents a key success for the United Nations.We also welcome the continued progress towards the resolution of the dispute in Western Sahara  on the basis of the peace plan presented by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) just over one year ago.In Central America  we applaud the stepping up of efforts by the Presidents of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua for the implementation of the Esquipulas II Agreement. We strongly support the help being provided by the United Nations towards the consolidation of democracy and an end to foreign interference in the region.The optimism generated by these positive developments  however  is tempered by the conflicts and problems that continue to afflict other parts of the world.In Afghanistan  despite the 1988 Geneva Accords  the civil war continues unabated  causing immense bloodshed and hardship among the people of that country. It is time that outside interference was converted into genuine interest in bringing peace and reconciliation to Afghanistan. The Afghan people need tools with which to reconstruct their country  not weapons with which to continue destroying it.We also regret the stalemate in the Paris Conference on Cambodia. The unilateral withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces has opened the way to a peaceful settlement. We urge all the parties concerned not to use the impasse in the peace negotiations as an opportunity to launch a new round of fighting  which would inflict fresh bloodshed and suffering on the Cambodian people.The implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  on the conflict between Iran and Iraq in large measure still eludes us  although the cease-fire agreed upon in 1988 remains in place and the loss of human lives has ended  lasting peace in the region depends on full agreement on the interpretation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) aid on its implementation.In the Middle East  the interrelated problems of Palestine and the Lebanon are of particular concern to Cyprus  in that their resolution is vital to peace in the region. We support the launching of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue  and regret strongly the deteriorating situation in the occupied territories  where the Israeli authorities continue to react to the intifadah with killings   and detentions on an increasingly large scale. We stress the need for effective negotiations based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  taking fully into account the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to live in peace in their own homeland.We congratulate President Arafat on the statesmanship displayed in the historic decisions for a just aid comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian problem which would both recognize the national rights of the Palestinian people and guarantee the security of all States in the region. The people of Israel â themselves victims of centuries of persecution - must recognize the futility of a policy that denies the aspiration of an entire people to live in their own homeland in peace and dignity.We are appalled by the tragedy of Lebanon and the enormous suffering of its people. We welcome the return to peace and the halt of Lebanon's disintegration  as a result of the efforts of the Arab League and of the Tripartite Committee on Lebanon. Cyprus has provided all possible humanitarian assistance to the large numbers of Lebanese fleeing the country in recent months. We hope that all the parties in Lebanon will realize the futility of war and will join forces in reconstituting their country.In South Africa  the racist system of apartheid has run its course - condemned by the international community not only as unjust but also as anachronistic. We cautiously welcome certain trends towards the dismantling of apartheid following the recent elections in South Africa  and hope for the speedy release of all political prisoners  the lifting of restrictions on political activity  and the restoration of freedom of speech aid movement. We should like to join the Secretary-General  however  in warning that a partial easing of the abhorrent system of apartheid will not solve the problem of South Africa  either in the eyes of the world or in the eyes of its people. Justice will be done fully only when apartheid is dismantled fully. The gravity of a problem must be measured not only in terms of the size of the territory or the number of people affected but also in terms of the principles involved. The Cyprus problem  viewed from the standpoint of principle  is an enormous moral problem  a clear case of breach of the accepted norms of international behaviour and of grave violations of the United Nations Charter  the Organization's resolutions on Cyprus and the rule of law.Cyprus has been subjected to invasion and occupation  forced displacement of one third of its population and massive colonization by citizens of the invading country: Turkey. There are 1 619 people who are still missing and all efforts to trace them have met with Turkish uncooperativeness. In recalling these facts  I do not intend to exchange recriminations with our powerful neighbour  Turkey? it is simply a matter of putting the Cyprus problem in perspective.Motivated by a sincere desire to put an end to the suffering of the people of Cyprus - Greek and Turkish - I expressed  soon after my election  my readiness to meet with Prime Minister Ozal of Turkey or with the President  General Evren  since certain aspects of the Cyprus problem  such as the presence of Turkish occupation troops and settlers  can be resolved only by Ankara  unfortunately Turkey has so far not accepted my proposal.At the same time we were happy to begin substantive talks with the Turkish Cypriot leader  Mr. Rauf Denktash  on the basis of a procedure proposed by the United Nations Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. More than 80 hours of talks with Mr. Denktash in the presence of the Secretary-General's Representative and three joint meetings in New York with the Secretary-General himself culminated  last Jute  in a set of ideas that Mr. Perez de Cuellar presented to the two sides as food for thought in further negotiations. In presenting those ideas the Secretary-General was acting fully within the mandate conferred upon him by the Security Council.Mr. Denktash's reaction was to reject the agreed negotiating procedure aid to challenge the mandated role of the Secretary-General. Mr. Denktash's position  also reflected in a resolution he secured from the so-called Turkish Cypriot Assembly  which was rejected by Turkish Cypriot opposition leaders  who we believe represent the majority opinion within their community  sets the withdrawal of the Secretary-General's ideas as a precondition for the resumption of talks.It is characteristic that the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey in his address yesterday referred to this resolution  but he failed to inform the Assembly that it demanded the withdrawal of the Secretary-General's ideas and that it laid down all sorts of pre-conditions.Mr. Denktash  through this resolution  also in effect rejects the 1977 high-level agreements reached by him aid Presidents Makarios and Ryprianou  which have been accepted by both sides as the basis for the current negotiations. Whereas those agreements provide for a unified federated Cyprus  Mr. Denktash is now demanding a separate state as a pre-condition for further dialogue. Whereas the high-level agreements support the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all the citizens of the Republic  Mr. Denktash envisages an apartheid regime in Cyprus with the complete segregation of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in two separate enclaves.Coupled with the further hardening of the Turkish attitude in the talks  there have been threats aid attempts to settle Muslims from Bulgaria in the occupied area of Cyprus. Those developments are aimed at creating new fait accompli that would seriously undermine the efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem. They also raise serious questions as to whether the objective of the Turkish side  rather than a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem  may not in fact be the legitimisation of the present division and occupation of nearly 40 per cent of Cyprus. Yesterday the Foreign Minister of Turkey called this occupied territory ""Turkish Cypriot"". This is indicative of Turkey's thinking. This territory is Cypriot territory. It belongs to all Cypriots  especially those who had lived there in ancestral homes for generations before they were expelled by the brute force of Turkey's military might.The Foreign Minister of Turkey also alluded to the Republic's purchases of arms. What does Turkey expect us to do? Should we sit idle while they amass 35 000 troops  300 modern tanks and other sophisticated equipment? We acquired defensive equipment including 16 tanks  for 10 000 to 12 000 young conscripts. Time and again we offered  in fact demanded  the demilitarisation of Cyprus.I challenge the Turkish Government; let is demilitarise Cyprus. Withdraw your 35 000 troops and we shall at the same time disband our forces and dispose of all our arms. Moreover  I reiterate the offer I made last year before the Assembly to use the funds released thereby for the development of Cyprus  especially for the Turkish-Cypriot community which has fallen behind.We stress that we do not  cannot and will not accept the status quo as a solution to the Cyprus problem. A situation in which human rights are violated  communities are forcibly segregated on ethnic and religious lines  and territory occupied by a foreign Power is neither just nor a guarantee against future conflicts. Nor can the status quo be accepted as a solution to the Cyprus problem by the international community  for all nations are acutely conscious of the destabilizing potential of legitimising the invasion and occupation of the territory of one sovereign State by the armies of another. It is particularly regrettable that the Turkish side is taking such a negative position at a time of progress in resolving regional problems world-wide  after a year of hard work in the negotiations which  with the assistance of the Secretary-General and his representatives  demonstrated that a solution to the Cyprus problem is feasible.The outlines of such a solution are clear. Cyprus would be federally organized and each community would have one region under its administration. The human rights of all citizens and the cultural identity aid economic well-being of both communities would be safeguarded. We have proposed that the Republic of Cyprus should be demilitarised and this  together with the federal provisions  leaves no room for anxiety on the part of the Turkish Cypriots regarding their security. The Republic as a whole  however  should also be secure. This means that there is no room in the Cyprus we are working to build for the presence of foreign troops or for unilateral rights of intervention by Turkey. A solution to the Cyprus problem is possible. Now more than ever we count on our friends in the international community not to allow impediments to be placed in its way.lb sum up  we can say that the new climate of confidence between the two super-Powers has effectively reversed the post-war trend towards regional conflicts and proxy wars. It has imposed significant restraints on the outbreak of new hostilities and transferred many disputes from the battlefield to the negotiating table. We are  however  still looking forward to the day when confidence between the superâPowers will have become great enough to give the various peace efforts under way the last decisive push towards their successful completion.The United Nations has an invaluable role to play in fulfilling the arduous task of settling problems and bringing peace to war-torn areas of the globe. We are gratified to note that as a result of the recent progress towards the resolution of conflicts four new peace-keeping operations have been launched in the last three years and an additional three are currently being actively considered. We strongly support the Secretary-General's recommendations for the strengthening of the role of the united Nations in order to boost compliance with the Organization's decisions and make the united Nations an effective agent for the prevention  and not just the termination  of conflicts. The States members of the Non-Aligned Movement  which include Cyprus and which form the backbone of the United Nations  can make a valuable contribution to the efforts to defuse conflicts aid strengthen the role of the Organization. Our public and private deliberations at last month's Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade  stressed the need for a constructive dialogue between the developed and the developing countries and explored ways of resolving global political problems  as well as economic aid social problems. Hence we welcome the increasing concern and involvement of the United Nations in problems of economic development a d in a number of global social issues with important political and economic implications.Our gains in the political field could be seriously undermined by existing economic inequalities and imbalances. Despite an improvement in world output and international trade during the past 12 months  the economic situation of the developing countries has continued to deteriorate. In many developing countries economic growth is stifled by the debt burden; the overall debt of the developing countries at the end of 1988 was estimated at 31 240 billion  and debt servicing at a massive $171 billion. The result is a net transfer of resources from the developing to the developed nations. According to last month's World Bank annual report  the transfer of resources from developing countries to all lenders in 1988 rose to about $50 billion  from $38 billion in the previous year.While we welcome the fact that several debt-relief initiatives have been put forward recently  we would like to stress that the third-world debt problem is largely the result of low commodity prices and adverse movements in terms of trade  exacerbated by high interest rates. Thus the debt problem can never be definitively resolved unless these issues are addressed. We believe there is an urgent need for a political dialogue on economic problemsâ The special session of the General assembly on economic issues next spring could provide an effective forum for such a dialogue. We also welcome efforts to revive the Economic and Social Council as a means of promoting the role of the United Nations in tackling economic and social issues. However  we would also like to emphasize the need for direct talks between the developed and the developing nations on these issues.We face today a set of problems that fall outside the strictly political and economic spheres but nevertheless significantly impinge upon them. These problems are  in varying degrees  common to all nations. Their elimination therefore requires concerted international action. The United Nations has a key role to play in generating and co-ordinating such action.One such problem is that of illicit drug abuse. Cyprus applauds efforts to combat illegal drug trafficking and is doing its best to contribute to the suppression of the drug trade. However  we stress the need to tackle the drug problem  which has grown to such proportions as to threaten the entire social fabric of some countries  not only by trying to stop the supply but also by trying to eliminate the demand.Not only economic rules but also common sense tell us that demand generates supply  and that under such circumstances attempting to suppress the supply merely drives up profits from production and distribution. We must find ways of reducing - even eliminating - these profits  bearing in mind at all times that drug addiction is an illness and not a crime. Meanwhile  we must continue efforts to expose and thus short-circuit the mechanisms of laundering drug profits through banks and other channels.The scourge of terrorism is sometimes a derivative of the drug trade. We stress the need for the sharing of information and the results of research for the detection of explosives or other tools of the terrorists' trade  and support Security Council resolution 638 (1989) condemning hostage-taking and calling for the release of all hostages.All our other achievements in the political  economic or social spheres will have been in vain unless we succeed in tackling the smouldering ecological crisis faced by our planet. There is only one Earth  and it is humankind's one and only home. There is a vital need to link economic with ecological management  to link considerations of profit and production with environmental considerations.We welcome the proposal made by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the Non-Aligned Conference in Belgrade for the establishment of a ""Planet Protection Fund"" and we recommend that this proposal be taken up here in the Assembly for further consideration and action. As early as 1972  the United Nations noted emerging environmental problems at the Conference on the Human Environment. The Organization can contribute significantly towards the elaboration of an integrated environmental policy to tackle problems such as the disposal of toxic or hazardous wastes  the depletion of the ozone layer  or desertification. We commend the ongoing United Nations Environment Programme - World Meteorological Organization study of climate change and its environmental and economic repercussions and the special United Nations study on key environmental issues  including the link between environment and development.We are witnessing today  just as we did at the time when the United Nations was created out of the ashes of the Second World War  a rebirth of hope. Hope in humankind's better nature  in the triumph of peace over war  co-operation over conflict  human rights over oppression  and reason over barbarism. The United Nations embodies these ideals and represents our best chance of working together as a world community  on the basis of common principles and interests  to achieve them.  In the year to come let us resolutely strive to end conflicts  let us reinforce our understanding of the common nature of many of our problems  and let us take action to extend respect for international law and consolidate a global ethical order. In concluding  I should like to leave members with the thought that the price of failing in these goals is one which none of us can afford to pay  while success cannot but benefit us all."
"38",1832,"DDR",44,1989,"ï»¿May I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly and warmly wish you success.A few weeks ago the international community observed the fiftieth anniversary of Hitler Germany's criminal aggression against Poland  which was the beginning of the most devastating and murderous of all conflagrations in the history of mankind. That inferno forged a coalition of States with different social systems and also gave birth to the United Nations  whose deeds offered mankind the chance of a peaceful future. The lesson drawn by the peoples was that war and fascism must be done away with and violence banned from international life forever and that henceforth joint action must be taken for their elimination in peacetime.To remove the kind of threat which weapons of mass destruction pose in our time  the German Democratic Republic believes the authority and influence of the United Nations will have to be brought into play more effectively than has been the case so far. Moreover  economic underdevelopment must be overcome and the natural environment preserved for man to exist. The potentials are there. What it takes to harness them is boldness in strengthening positive elements  carefulness in shoring up achievements  and resoluteness in stemming reverse tendencies.But there is cause for concern: since the arms race is continuing in all fields while Treaty on the Elimination of the Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is being implemented and disarmament negotiations are under way  since long-standing conflicts cannot be solved because not all of those involved are willing to take account of the legitimate interests of each and every party to those conflicts; since a number of countries have recorded substantial economic growth while an increasing number of third-world nations are falling back further and further in their levels of development; since the natural environment is increasingly deteriorating - one reason being that international measures taken to protect it are insufficient; and since attacks against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  as well as interference in international affairs of other States  are mounting while world-wide demands are made for strengthening the international order of law.Bertolt Brecht  the playwright  has Galileo Galilei expressing faith in the ""gentle force of reason""  which people cannot withstand in the long run. The nuclear and space age  with the apocalyptic risks for humankind  makes imperative a new kind of thinking on security policy. Yet this awareness does not grow all on its own.Shop-worn notions and attitudes need to be shed through a dialogue  across all frontiers  among political and military leaders  scholars  scientists and indeed all people committed to peace. They need to be replaced by a modern way of thinking and conduct marked by high ethical values and a sense of reason and reality. On the threshold of the next millennium  this is the only approach that can hold out a perspective of peace for all nations. Quite a few of these aspects have been reflected in international documents.It has been encouraging to note that the declarations adopted at the Ninth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned States express a firm resolve to find agreed solutions to the pressing problems of our planet in a peaceful and constructive dialogue with all other States.On the other hand  much remains to be done for the awareness to gain ground that lasting security can be built only through co-operation  rather than confrontation. Above all  it is imperative to abandon all doctrines which preserve  or even feed  hostile images  stimulate the arms race and even keep open the first-use option for nuclear weapons.The German Democratic Republic insists on a joint review of military concepts and their strict orientation towards defence. Also  the United Nations should seize upon this matter. Thus substance would be built into the prohibition of the use of force as spelled out in the Charter  and world-wide adherence to it would be ensured.Stable security for all can grow only from a policy that takes account of the intertwining of military  political  economic and humanitarian factors and seeks further to push back military might in favour of shared political endeavours.  This is the purpose of the initiative of socialist States for a comprehensive approach to the strengthening of international security  which would guarantee that all States in the different regions could live together without conflicts and tensions in true good-neighbourliness. In Europe  efforts must remain concentrated on reducing the cram-full arsenals to a level where the danger of war will be banished for ever. The East and the West could then on a new basis and for the benefit of all peoples co-operate and build harmoniously.The Vienna negotiations on conventional armed forces and on further confidence- and security-building measures could soon produce first agreements on mutual force and arms reductions if all participants negotiated constructively and were ready for compromise. The German Democratic Republic  like its allies  has made exemplary unilateral moves contributing to propitious conditions for speedy negotiations. Before 1990  the German Democratic Republic's armed forces will be reduced by 10 000 troops  600 tanks and 50 aircraft. We already have at hand initial practical experience in partial areas of arms conversion  which we gladly share at the international Level.I wish to recall with all due emphasis the proposal by the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty that  in parallel with the Vienna talks on conventional forces and armaments  negotiations should be started also on tactical nuclear weapons. Our aim remains a Europe  indeed a world  without nuclear weapons.Mindful of the sensitive divide between the two military alliances  and seeking cuts in weapons of mass destruction in Central Europe  the German Democratic Republic advocates the establishment of zones free of nuclear and chemical weapons  with specific confidence-building measures being applied.Let me point out in this context that it is not the diversity of systems of society that renders the construction of the European home problematic. Rather its coming into being is obstructed by the arms race  the sustained military threat and  recently  the redoubled attempts to do away with socialism as a social system.The road towards stable peace and productive co-operation is not smooth  yet it is practicable. However  it must not be made harder to travel on than it already is. The achievements made in Europe over the last two decades through joint efforts - a record all can take pride in - were possible because the Helsinki Final Act meant recognition of international legal principles as set out in the United Nations Charter and the political and territorial realities that emerged after the Second World War. This must remain agreed. Claims to the effect that the ""German Reich"" continued to exist within the 1937 borders are as dangerous as they are irrational  for the ""German Reich"" fell asunder in 1945 as a consequence of its own policy of aggression.The realities in Europe that have since emerged include the existence of two sovereign German States. Their mutual relationship is  and continues to be  of great importance for stability in Europe and the progress of detente in the world. This is what guides the socialist German State  which will be observing its fortieth anniversary in a few days. Anyone who wants stability in Europe will appreciate the fact that at the divide between the world's two biggest military alliances there exists a State whose supreme credo is  ""No more war - only peace shall ever emanate from German soil"". The German Democratic Republic's policy  firmly rooted in anti-fascist traditions and relying on the dynamic development of its society  remains predictable. The socialist German State has done a great deal on behalf of peaceful coexistence in Europe in the past  and it will do likewise in the future.The German Democratic Republic abides by what the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party and Chairman of the Council of State  Erich Honecker  and the Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany  Helmut Kohl  agreed in March 1985 and what they reaffirmed in their joint communiquÃ© in September 1987.- that inviolability of the frontiers is a basic condition for peace. To preserve and to strengthen it through new confidence-building measures remains the need of the hour. Calling frontiers into question or making presumptuous claims under the mantle of concern for humanity and in violation of the sovereign rights of other States  and exercising so-called custodianship over nationals of other states - that is bound to provoke conflicts that erode co-operation in the heart of Europe and even put peace in jeopardy. Disarmament  the settlement or prevention of international conflicts and the strengthening of the international rule of law are guarantees for a world of peace  security and common welfare.In this context disarmament remains the key issue. The implementation of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  which must not be undercut by what is called modernization  is in the interests of all peoples. But it is equally obvious that the pace of the ongoing negotiations is insufficient  in fact very far from what is necessary. From the German Democratic Republic's viewpoint it is imperative to include all weapons categories in the negotiations  to break the vicious circle in the arms race and to make no compensation for weapons eliminated and  consequently  to offer results to the peoples.We would like to see the USSR and the United States succeed as soon as possible in halving their strategic nuclear armaments while adhering to the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems - the ABM Treaty.In order to halt the nuclear arms race  an overwhelming majority of States has been calling for a complete ban on nuclear-weapons tests. Such a ban would  at the same time  strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In that context  the Soviet Union's proposal to cease the production of fissionable material for armament purposes deserves the support of the United Nations.In January this year  the participants in the Paris Conference urged the earliest possible conclusion of a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. However  the Geneva negotiations have yet to make any real progress. Yet the risk of a proliferation of these means of mass destruction increases proportionally to the delay in concluding a world-wide convention.This delay is incomprehensible  since there is agreement on the essential issues of the convention. Data are being exchanged and verification methods have been tested. The German Democratic Republic  which neither possesses chemical weapons nor has such weapons stockpiled on its territory  has transmitted data relating to its chemical production and the results of a national trial inspection. Before this forum  I wish to reaffirm the proposal to convene a meeting of foreign ministers at the Geneva Conference so as to proceed to the final stage of the negotiations. We welcome the results of the recent talks between the USSR and the United States committing them to the conclusion of a relevant convention not later than next year.The prevention of an arms race in outer space is becoming ever more urgent. Fear the sake of step-by-step solutions  the German Democratic Republic submitted basic elements at the Geneva Conference for a treaty to ban anti-satellite weapons  and it hopes that negotiations will start soon. In that respect  the world organization will certainly find important areas for action. It could  for instance  evaluate existing findings and available experiences in respect of arms conversion and make them accessible to all States. This directs our attention to the general requirement to utilize modern sciences and technologies for disarmament. I propose that henceforth this topic be considered by the United Nations. The German Democratic Republic believes that efforts to define criteria for comparing military budgets should be continued  so as to promote openness in the military field. Consequently  my country will be making use of the United Nations international system for the standardized reporting of military expenditures and provide the available data as from 1990.Apparently  one of the most important experiences which the end of the twentieth century will leave behind is that disputes and conflicts can no longer be resolved by military means. They can only be settled on the basis of respect for the legitimate interests of the parties in conflict  who must meet each other halfway in a spirit of compromise. In those terms  the United Nations and its Secretary-General - and I take pleasure in emphasizing this - play a highly appreciated promotive role. The Organizations' peace-keeping operations have stood the test  and my country supports then.It is with great sympathy that the world is following Namibia's transition to independence. The German Democratic Republic has long supported that process. It helped repatriate Namibian refugees and has met the Secretary-General's request to dispatch police monitors and election supervisors. It is imperative that the elections in November not be impeded  so that we can welcome a free Namibia as amember of the world organization before long. Implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is conducive to peace and stability in southern Africa. Yet apartheid  the main cause of conflicts  continues to exist in that region  and allThe socialist German State is very much concerned that no peace is yet in sight in the Middle East. The Palestinian people is still being deprived by force of its legitimate rights  and its uprising is being rigorously repressed.It would be in the interest of all concerned and of peace in general to resolve these and other problems in the region through an international Middle East peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the Palestine Liberation organization  Israel  and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council participating on an equal footing.A peaceful settlement of the question of Western Sahara  with the participation of the organization of African Unity and the United Nations  would constitute another milestone on the road of the African nations towards a durable peace and social progress.The Cyprus question  too  remains unresolved. Negotiations should be encouraged between the leaders of the two ethnic communities  mediated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  on a settlement that would meet the interests of the entire Cypriot people.In today's international conditions and in view of the requirements of tomorrow  international law assumes increasing importance for the security of States and good-neighbourly co-operation. Nothing could conceivably be more effective than such principles as the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the obligation to settle disputes peacefully.The German Democratic Republic therefore supports the initiative of the non-aligned countries to have a decade of international law adopted by the United Nations for the next ten years.In our view  the most urgent tasks in strengthening the international order of law which must be the foundation of an order of peace are  first  to bring about a reliable consensus on the interpretation and application of existing principles as enshrined in the United Nations Charter.The second task is to work out treaties to manage problems that need to be addressed globally. We think these include protection of the environment  the use of modern communication technologies  the combating of terrorism  and the prevention of drug abuse. The early adoption of a code covering crimes against the peace and security of mankind and of a convention against the use of mercenaries would create a solid legal foundation for the prosecution and punishment of the gravest of crimes and would at the same time have preventive effects that should not be underestimated.The third task is to make greater use of international mechanisms and  where necessary  create new ones to ensure the fulfilment of commitments that have been undertaken.In the field of human rights and social issues  the requirements of peaceful co-operation must be lived up to. That requires the strengthening of peace as an indispensable foundation for the implementation of human rights. In its practical work the United Nations should heed the interrelationship of political  economic and social rights. A stable and prosperous world needs sound and mutually advantageous economic co-operation. Historical reasons account for the existence of imbalances  but nothing can justify the fact that many third-world countries  not least because of inequitable terms of trade  cannot develop in socio-economic terms. Evidence of that is the fact that the World Bank recently settled its accounts with a net profit of $1 billion  squeezing more out of developing countries than it put into them.The United Nations can and must commit itself to a marked improvement of that situation. The 1990 special session of the General Assembly devoted to economic issues and preparatory work for the international development strategy for the next decade are appropriate contexts in which to define priorities for international economic co-operation and for the activities of the United Nations in that area. An agreed settlement of the debt problem of the developing countries has to be regarded as the most pressing issue in that respect. Against that background  the German Democratic Republic deems implementation of the principle of disarmament for development to be an imperative of the highest priority. Since disarmament and the safe elimination of highly sophisticated weaponry  no less than armament itself  are becoming more and more costly  it would be most beneficial for all to break once and for all the cycle of arms build-ups and subsequent disarmament. Fruitful development of the entire world economy requires political will by all to bring about co-operative and viable solutions. The same applies to ecological problems. Mankind must not destroy its own natural basis of existence. Today we are more aware of the life-sustaining interaction between our planet's water  air  soil and forests. We can now see more clearly that the sensitive balance between those factors cannot be upset with impunity.The United Nations brings together the collective spirit and will of nations and pools their efforts into a single stream  it harmoniously combines national and international security interests. There is no more competent forum that could keep watch over world peace in a better way. The main source of the effectiveness and strength of the United Nations is the determination and willingness of its Member states to pursue the only road that could possibly lead mankind into a peaceful third millennium: the road of constructive co-operation in all fields of human life."
"39",1850,"DEU",44,1989,"ï»¿I congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. Your experience and the esteem in which you are held as the former Foreign Minister of Nigeria  as its Permanent Representative to the United Nations and as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid guarantee that you will excellently perform the duties of your office. At the same time I wish to pay deepest respect to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  and thank him for the exemplary and successful conduct of his functions.Foreign Minister Dumas of France presented the views of the members of the European Community yesterday. I thank him for his clear statement. Now  at the closing of this millennium we are moving towards a new phase in world politics. The old structures still largely determine the political scene. but new structures are already becoming visible everywhere. We are confronted with global challenges. The natural sources of life are increasingly being jeopardized. In the last two years  world food production dropped for the first time. Plants and animals are becoming extinct. New epidemics are spreading. A large part of mankind lives in dire poverty. Terrorism and illicit drug trafficking call for joint action by the international community. Underdevelopment and the debt burden deprive a large section of mankind of any hope. Excessive armaments and regional conflicts  as well as violations of human rights and of the right of nations to self-determination  require fundamental new thinking and actions  m Europe there is fresh hope for a better future. This will have positive effects on the entire world.In the year 2030 there will be 10 billion people on earth. For their sake -and it is not for distant descendants whose faces are hidden from us by the mist of distant centuries; it is for our children  our grandchildren - we must today lay the groundwork so that the glebe will remain habitable. No single country on Earth  however rich and powerful  is able to handle this task by itself and through its own ability. Joint efforts by all mankind are needed. First and foremost this means that we must move away from confrontation towards co-operation  we require co-operative structures.Precisely because we Germans are aware of our responsibility for the Second World war we perceive our duty to work for a better world  for a world of peace  democracy and solidarity between nations  for a world of freedom and human rights  for a world at peace with nature. The Polish nation was the first victim of the war deliberately unleashed by Hitlerian Germany 50 years ago. And I am turning to You Mr. Skubiszewski  Foreign Minister of the new Poland  to say that the Polish people are assured that their right to live in secure borders will not be called into question  not now nor in the future  through territorial claims by us Germans. The wheel of history will not be turned back. Together with Poland we want to work for a better future for Europe. The inviolability of borders is the basis of peaceful relations in Europe.Ever since its inception the Federal Republic of Germany has framed a European peace policy. As a member of the European Community and of the Atlantic Alliance  we belong to the family of Western democracies. To the United States we are linked through deep friendship  through the Alliance and through a commitment to common values. President Bush impressively reaffirmed this in his speech at Mainz  with France we have established a unique partnership and co-operation  as reflected in the Franco-German Treaty and in our day-today politics. This points to the future. The groundwork for the developments we are today witnessing in Europe  for the prospects that are now discernible  was laid by the founding of the European Community  by the treaties of Moscow and Warsaw  by the treaty with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  by the Basic Treaty with the German Democratic Republic and by the Helsinki Final Act. These are European paths that come towards each other; they must therefore be strengthened and extended. Nobody will be allowed to stray from them. We shall remain committed to the letter and spirit of those treaties.Major elements of that peaceful order are the European Community and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process. The European Community  which is heading for a European Union  sees itself as a factor for economic and political stability in the world  it maintains closer relations  including those based on agreements with its neighbours in Europe and with States and groupings of States in all other continents. It strongly promotes voluntary regional associations in other parts of the world. It has to be open to multifaceted and broad-based co-operation with those countries of Central and Eastern Europe that desire it. New forms of co-operation and exchange are required. EUREKA is an offer open to all those who are interested. The new environment agency set up by the European Community can become the starting-point of new pan-European co-operation in the area of the protection of the environment.Transport structures covering the whole of Europe are needed. We are receptive to ideas and suggestions from others. The trade limitations introduced for strategic reasons must be adapted to the changed quality of political  security-policy  economic and technological co-operation between West and East. They must not become an obstacle to a far-sighted policy.East and West have opted for the path of co-operation. That is a source of hope for the nations of the world - not only the nations of Europe  The vision of a peaceful order in Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals - as the West proposed in the Harmel report as early as 1967  and as recurs in General Secretary Gorbachev's concept of the common European house - is opening up. The bold reforms in the Soviet Union  in Hungary and in Poland point in that direction.We agree with our Western friends that the reform processes in Central and Eastern Europe are in the interests of all Europe and of the world. They deserve our support  not least through common  co-ordinated action  through a plan of solidarity for Europe. This process of reform in Central and Eastern Europe is not a case of one side's opinion being adopted by the other; it is a process of self-reflection on the common foundations of European culture and European history  to which all European nations have made great contributions. The reforms have become irreversible because man's yearning for more freedom is irreversible  but the developments are not immune to standstills  or even setbacks. In the long run  however  no country can evade this development. Anyone who hopes that the reforms will fail will be overtaken by the development.In the West  too  nobody should underestimate the new possibilities; instead  people should make resolute use of them for the benefit of all Europe. History tends not to repeat the opportunities it offers. I appeal to the countries of Europe not to let this historic juncture slip by. We Western democracies offer stable-framework conditions for this reform process. Statesmanly foresight and statesmanly responsibility are required now on all sides. Nobody can want others to be destabilized. The Federal Republic of Germany regards a peaceful order in Europe as the framework also for the goal defined in the Letter on German Unity: ""to work for a state of peace in Europe in which the German nation will recover its unity in free self-determination"". We want to attain this goal while fully observing the treaties that we have signed. That can be achieved only together with all other States in Europe - not against them. Nobody in Europe has cause to fear our policy. Our policy is linked to the destiny of the entire continent. It is a European peace policy. This precludes any national solo efforts. We consider it our task to work for a pan-European peaceful order from which no country may be excluded or nay exclude itself  our foreign policy  in accordance with the dictates of our Constitution  rejects any kind of power politics. It is a policy of responsibility  it is determined by the fundamental values of our Constitution  it is based on unconditional fidelity to treaties.The Federal Republic of Germany  as a country situated in the heart of Europe  brings all its weight to bear for the purpose of co-operation  understanding and disarmament conducive to a better Europe. This includes cooperation with the German Democratic Republic. The two German States are aware of their responsibility for peace in Europe. This responsibility weighs more heavily than do those things that divide us. On the basis of this common responsibility   the two German States have already made substantial contributions towards detente and disarmament in Europe. In particular  the people in our States have benefited from this. In these endeavours we act on the foundation of the basic Treaty with the German Democratic Republic and are guided by the Joint declarations issued by Chancellor Kohl and General Secretary Honecker on 12 March 1965 and 8 September 1 87. New and closer forms of co-operation are needed in many fields - economic and technological  scientific and cultural  transport and protection of the environment.The two German states - each in its own fashion - must contribute towards overcoming the things that separate Europeans from each other. They must face the new developments occurring in the whole of Europe and work for their success. The Federal Republic of Germany wholeheartedly supports the process of European unification within the European Community  as well as the efforts of Europeancountries aimed at reform. The German Democratic Republic  under its own conditions  can contribute  through reforms  towards greater openness in Europe. just as the Soviet Union  Poland and Hungary are doing already. We have been deeply moved as we have witnessed  in recent weeks  the fate of young people who are sorrowfully leaving their home and familiar borrowings. Nobody can want such a development. A policy of reform would open up new prospects for the people of the German Democratic Republic  as in other Central and Eastern European countries. These would encourage the people to stay where they grew up and where they are at home. Today  East and West no longer discuss only the problems that have accused between them since the War. They Jointly focus their attention also on those tasks of the future which  as is stated in the Joint German-Soviet Declaration of June 1989  can be mastered only through concerted action by all states and  peoples. The Moscow Treaty continues to form the foundation of the relationship between our two countries. The German-Soviet Declaration underscores the importance of German-Soviet relations for the whole of Europe. This calls for new thinking by everyone and for everyone.That declaration defined goals to which we have long been committed along with our Western partners-  the preservation and shaping of peace  the settlement of existing conflicts  the right of nations to self-determination  the precedence of international law in politics  international co-operation in the economic  scientific and technological fields  the results of which should benefit all mankind  the preservation of the natural environment and the overcoming of hunger and poverty in the world  and the combating of new threats such as epidemics and international terrorism. A peaceful world of free people subject only to the rule of law and whose dignity is no longer impaired by hunger and poverty: that is seen as the true goal of politics. In that way  the design of a peaceful order for all Europe  the architecture of a pan-European house  is becoming clearly visible. Through arms control and disarmament we want to reduce the military elements of the East-West relationship. We want to demilitarise East-West relations  just as international relations must be demilitarized. We want to create an increasing number of co-operative security structures. We welcome and support the efforts of the United states and the Soviet Union to achieve co-operation marked by increasing mutual trust.An entire continent is seriously committed to agreed and controlled disarmament. The Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces - the INF Treaty - was an important step towards that end. The two sides accept the principle that whoever has more weapons must disarm more. The aim is to ensure that the armed forces of the two sides have the capability of defence only and not of attack  especially surprise attack and large-scale offensive action. Ever more co-operative security structures will emerge  thus providing additional guarantees of security. The negotiations in Vienna on conventional stability and confidence-building measures  as well as the global prohibition of chemical weapons  will lend a new quality to those security structures. The meetings between Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze have provided further signs of hope. In Vienna  Western proposals have created the conditions for far-reaching conventional disarmament. Given good will on the part of all concerned  an initial agreement could be achieved as early as 1990.We strongly support the United States-Soviet negotiations in Geneva on nuclear and space weapons. By reducing their nuclear weapons  the nuclear Powers are living up to their responsibility towards the international community. The need for all countries to accede to the non-proliferation Treaty is becoming all the more urgent.The negotiations on a comprehensive  global and verifiable ban on chemical weapons must finally be completed. Only in that way can the spread of those barbaric weapons be prevented. President Bush's declaration here at the United Nations that his country is ready to destroy over 80 per cent of its existing chemical weapons stocks even before the conclusion of a chemical weapons convention  provided that the Soviet Union reduces its chemical weapons to the same level  is unprecedented in the history of disarmament negotiations. The Federal Republic of Germany has constantly striven for the successful completion of the Geneva negotiations. President Bush's remarks concerning verification of compliance with a future chemical weapons convention have a significance that goes far beyond the scope of disarmament negotiations. Openness is becoming a guiding principle in dealings between countries. In fact  every step towards a more open world is a step towards the new world we seek.The recent Canberra Conference made an important contribution in support of the Geneva negotiations. All producers are called upon to control trade in chemical substances and facilities that are suitable also for the manufacture of chemical weapons. The Federal Republic of Germany has considerably tightened its own control laws; as acknowledged in the final declaration of the Canberra Conference  it has thus made an advance contribution to the implementation of a future chemical weapons convention.Disarmament is a task not for the industrial nations alone. The developing countries spend $200 billion a year for military purposes. That is four times the official development assistance they receive. Moreover  those resources are unavailable for their development. Regional theatres of conflict are exacerbated by the unbridled trade in arms. The arms trade must become more transparent to the international public. Such transparency forces both the importers and the exporters to account for and justify their actions  which itself has a moderating effect. The wholly disproportionate level of arms in all parts of the world makes disarmament a global task which must be dealt with by the United Nations.A country's attitude towards disarmament is the most reliable measure of how far it is prepared to abandon old thinking. A State's attitude towards human rights is the most reliable measure of its stance on the inalienable dignity of each individual. A peaceful order in Europe - a peaceful order in the world - can rest only on the universal application of human rights and on the right of nations to self-determination. The future Europe is thus to be a large heterogeneous area based throughout on the rule of law.To us  respect for human rights is the indispensable basis for any policy. In our view  there is still an urgent need to appoint a United Nations high commissioner for human rights and set up an international court of human rights. We ask that our initiative on abolishing capital punishment be supported also by those countries which  frequently for religious reasons  want to retain such punishment. The form of optional protocol we have chosen leaves the door open to those States that are not yet able to decide in favour of signing it. International terrorism world wide and international drug crimes constitute aggression against human dignity and against mankind. They threaten every political and social order. In future  countries will have to be measured by their efforts in this fight. Anyone who provides refuge for terrorists or spares those who commit drug crimes is placing himself outside the community of nations. The drug problem  that scourge of mankind  has become a global challenge.This demands resolute co-operation by all countries. The common fight against illicit drug trafficking must be stepped up. Co-operation among all countries in combating cross-border illicit drug trafficking must be intensified. The social causes of drug production must be eliminated in the relevant countries through common efforts  and the social causes of drug dependence in the consumer countries must be eliminated as well.We shall survive the third millennium only if all countries - large and small  weak and strong alike - unconditionally make international law the yardstick of their political actions. We must overcome force  both within and between States. The decade ahead of us must be a decade of pacifying regional theatres of conflict. A historic opportunity is emerging for the Central American peace process. All Governments interested in the fate of Central America have in the meantime fully endorsed the Esquipulas peace agreement. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany supports the United Nations contribution to that process.Namibia  the last colony in Africa  will gain independence in a few months' time. The Western Contact Group  to which we belonged  initiated this process and participated substantially in shaping it. We are convinced that the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his special representative will bring the peace process in Namibia to a good conclusion. In so doing  they have the full confidence and support of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. Our participation in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) reflects this  we all hope that an independent Namibia that espouses democracy  pluralism and human rights will send signals to the Republic of South Africa that cannot be ignored. Apartheid is inimical to human rights. It cannot be reformed. It must be eliminated. We call upon the South African Government to terminate the state of emergency  to release all political detainees  Nelson Mandela in the first place  and to admit the opposition. That must pave the way for negotiations involving all the country's political forces for the purpose of developing a just constitutional order. we shall do ""whatever is possible to help bring about round-table negotiations.In the Middle East the objective continues to be a peaceful settlement that guarantees the right of all States in the region  including Israel  to live within secure and recognized boundaries and that enables the Palestinian people finally to exercise its right to self-determination. During the past few months there has been some movement in the Middle East conflict: the Israeli plan for elections in the occupied territories and President Mubarak's proposal to open up prospects for talks between Israel and the Palestinians.The suffering of the Lebanese nation must be ended through a political solution. The cease-fire brought about by the Arab League's Committee of Three is an encouraging signal. We support all suitable efforts aimed at national reconciliation in Lebanon and the restoration of the country's full sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence.In view of the dangers constantly generated by regional conflicts  a far-reaching improvement of the United Nations instruments for coping with those conflicts is needed. The Declaration on the prevention of conflicts  which we helped to draft in the Special Committee on the United Nations Charter and which was unanimously adopted at the forty-third session of the General Assembly  is a step towards that end. We have launched a new initiative designed to facilitate early and comprehensive fact-finding by the United Nations  particularly by the Secretary-General. The efforts of the United Nations and the Secretary-General to resolve conflicts must not fail for want of money.Underdevelopment in large parts of the world is one of the global challenges of our time. People in all countries are entitled to a life that is worth living. Industrial and developing countries must collaborate to achieve economic development and social justice. The debt crisis can only be resolved through joint action by everyone concerned: the debtor and creditor countries  the Governments and the international financial institutions  as well as the private banks. All creditor countries are now  as before  called upon to frame their national regulations in such a way as to encourage participation by banks in debt relief. That is already the case in our country  without considerable funds from private banks the developing countries will not return to the path of growth.The initiative of United States Secretary of the Treasury Brady is an important step in solving the debt crisis. At the forefront of the intensified debt strategy is the reduction of debts and interest. Fresh money must be made available. The rescheduling agreements with Mexico and the Philippines are major landmarks in the efforts to solve the debt crisis. The debts of the least-developed countries must be cancelled-  the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has already done so. For years now it has been providing development aid to those countries exclusively in the form of grants.Many developing countries are carrying out radical and painful reforms in order to reshape their economic structures. They are thereby making a substantial contribution towards the stability of the world economy. These reforms should restore the confidence of domestic and foreign investors.The prosperity of all countries can be increased most effectively through the free exchange of goods and services. That is why it is so important to make the Uruguay Round a full success. That still calls for considerable exertions and concessions  not least in areas that are sensitive for the industrial nations. All countries must resist the temptations of protectionism. The weakest are always hardest hit by the consequences of protectionism. The basic principles of the new thinking - openness instead of isolation  co-operation instead of confrontation - must also apply to international trade. The Belgrade conference of the Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms this new thinking and reflects the growing awareness of global interdependence.Today it is a question of reconciling economic and ecological factors. People are increasingly resisting the destruction of the natural sources of life. There is no nation that is not affected  no nation that does not bear responsibility. Global warming  destruction of the ozone layer  desertification  contamination of soil  air and water through pollutants and waste and forest depletion all threaten life on our earth. We have but this one Earth  and it has been entrusted to us. It must remain habitable for all future generations as well. Mankind's duty to preserve peace includes making peace with nature. The first steps have been taken with the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol  the Convention on hazardous waste and the Convention to combat marine pollution. Those Conventions must now be applied worldwide. They must constantly be supplemented and improved until all known pollutants are covered. The World Climate Convention and measures to save the forests must be vigorously promoted. Protection of tropical rain forests is also a matter for the United Nations. The Organization must pool and co-ordinate the efforts of the international community in the field of environmental protection. Binding limits and levels must be fixed  and agreed deadlines must be met. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany will do its utmost to support all environmental activities of the United Nations  especially the United Nations conference on the environment which this General Assembly is to decide on at this session. This applies also to the international decade for the prevention of natural disasters. The Federal Government has made substantial efforts to protect natural resources. It will contribute to the work of the United Nations the experience of a country that has a strong environmental awareness  high environmental protection standards and advanced scientific and technological know-how.The industrial nations must make a special contribution through the transfer of ecologically sound technology and through financial support for environmental projects in the developing countries. We must increase the responsibility of the United Nations for environmental matters and develop further its relevant organs  especially the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  widen their powers and  in particular  provide them with more funds.The nations will achieve a new spirit of coexistence only if they acknowledge and respect each other's cultural achievements and characteristics. The awareness of mutual dependence in questions concerning our survival must be accompanied by unconditional respect for the dignity and achievements of every nation. The worldwide cultural dialogue should preserve the cultural identity of all nations. This calls for exchange on equal terms through mutual give-and-take.The prestige of the United Nations increases with the new spirit of coexistence and the awareness of the need for a global domestic policy. This is not least a consequence of the growing understanding between West and East. The turn of the tide in international relations will also enable the United Nations to play the role its founders intended it to have  after the terrible experiences of the Second World War.We can no longer afford confrontation and national egoism  as our extinction would be the penalty. The United Nations must evolve into a universal community of States and peoples in which everyone can express his views freely and openly  in which the rights of the stronger do not prevail. To all individuals and nations  the United Nations is already a symbol of a new international order founded on human rights and self-determination  on dialogue and co-operation. We are called upon to create peace between individuals  between nations. We are called upon to create peace between man and nature. Inalienable human rights and the right of nations to self-determination must form the bedrock of our actions."
"40",1888,"DJI",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me at the outset  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  to extend our warm brotherly felicitations to Mr. Garba of Nigeria on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His long-proved record in public and international service  coupled with his bread diplomatic skills and his keen sensitivity to the manifold issues before us  makes him uniquely qualified to guide us ably in our deliberations.I wish also to take this opportunity to convey to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  our sincere appreciation of the fine leadership qualities he brought to bear on the conduct of the last session.We are proud to recognize  as usual  the quiet but effective diplomacy deployed relentlessly by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in both his quest for enduring solutions to the numerous intractable conflicts and his efforts to enhance the awareness of crucial developmental problem. We highly value his unruffled stewardship as he perseveres in steering us carefully away from collision and confrontation towards co-operation and consensus-building.The changes that are now taking place in the domestic and foreign policies of the countries of eastern Europe have fundamentally affected the climate of international relations. For more than four decades the world has been plunged in divisions and tensions as a result of political polarizations  which has inevitably placed a tremendous burden on mutual respect and concurrence. It was  indeed  an era characterized by a massive build-up of arms and troops as it naturally also embraced regional conflicts and the superiority of national security interests as a political strategy.The developing countries  closely lumped together as the third world  not only became the ideological  proxies or testing grounds  but were coveted prizes in the underlying politics of the big-Power rivalry.In the intervening years these poor countries have been alternately confused and exhilarated by the apparent choices open to them  so that often local  social and economic imperatives have been subordinated to broad political initiatives. Even bread-and-butter issues involving basic human needs have lacked the desired focus. In taking stock  therefore  of our past problems we ought to be careful not to be misled by false impressions of accomplishment. The reality is that standards of living dropped  political instability increased and sustained economic growth diminished. In all to many instances this malaise was associated with the absence of reliable infrastructure  inadequate education  chaotic housing and social problems.It is a relief of some kind that the new perceptions in international relations seem to underscore genuine concessions  relative predictability and enhanced credibility. No one  perhaps  is better qualified than the Soviet leader  Mr. Gorbachev  who convincingly has stated that ""Soviet security cannot be achieved at the price of the insecurity of other countries.""All this has serious implications for the many countries with protracted conflicts in their backyards as well as across their borders. Whether lasting settlements to the long-simmering disputes are to be found at the local level  through super-Power co-operation or through the United Nations  this definitely is the most auspicious moment for peace. Let us seize it; let us give peace a chance. We are extremely encouraged by the positive developments in peace-making and peaceful overtures that have been demonstrated everywhere  at both the domestic and the regional level.The gains thus achieved in the international political arena  both in atmosphere and in substance  ought to be translated into practical action. They need not remain the exclusive preserve of the super-Powers; nor need they be directed only towards political and economic liberalization in the East. It would be inconsistent with moral justice and social equity if the improved climate of East-West relations bred complacency and neglect of third-world issues.In the words of David Newsom  former Under Secretary of State and current Director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University: ""To declare victory new  and to imply that the end of the cold war makes issues in the third world of less relevance  is to ignore regions in which serious global problems have arisen in the past and may again."" The African continent faces formidable challenges in the 1990s in its efforts at improving the living standards and quality of life of its populations. The worsening economic performance  against the background of severe drought conditions deteriorating terms of trade  weak international demand and high debt-servicing costs  continues to be a source of grave concern. While the long-term growth prospect has policy implications for improving human capital  mobilizing domestic savings and promoting exports  we need at the same time to give recognition to the inherent structural problems.Some of .these will be insurmountable so long as external constraints - such asdwindling export earnings  a dearth of finance for development and the staggering debt-servicing burden - play a major role in the continuing unsatisfactory macro-economic performance of the African economies. These constraints severely limit efforts towards economic restructuring and policy reforms intended to enhance recovery and bring about sustained growth and development.The adverse effects of the crippling external debts are far-reaching and unfathomable  with debt servicing swallowing up over 40 per cent of export earnings in the case of Africa. According to the Economic Report on Africa  1989  of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa:""The continuing rise in the volume of debt and debt ratio underscores the excessive burden imposed on African economies and their vulnerability to adverse external developments. The proper understanding of African debt crisis  therefore  requires it to be placed within the framework of the concomitant adverse developments in commodity prices and resource flows and the ongoing efforts of adjustment.""At this juncture  we wish to record our profound satisfaction at the timely and generous decisions to cancel the entire outstanding public debts of over 30 African countries by France  Canada  Belgium  Italy and the United States of America. Most of the initiatives designed to alleviate the debt burden seem  regrettably  to share a common strategy linking debt relief or debt rescheduling arrangements to medium-term adjustment programmes  with a strong element of structural reforms  which  in International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank parlance ""are aimed at reducing economic distortions and financial imbalances"". More often than not such a strategy does not achieve the desired objective. Instead  it engenders untold hardship and domestic civil turmoil  not to mention  of course  the  inevitable political dimension of the impact of structural adjustment.Perhaps it is a matter not so much of deficiency in the strategy as of its true relevance to the level and pattern of development of most developing countries  in particular in Africa  where zero economic growth has been the characteristic trend  despite the presence of the largest per capita number of foreign advisers in the world. That undeniably lies at the heart of the problem. If that is not the case one may well ask why it is that economic and social conditions in Africa today are significantly worse than 25 years ago given the substantial infusions of financial and technical assistance from the World Bank  the IMF and the developed countries.It is high time  therefore  that the premier international development agencies realized the uniqueness of this group of countries and devised an appropriate  novel philosophical basis and theoretical framework for a specific  far-reaching  responsive and humane development strategy. Needless to say  this requires courage and iconoclastic vision on the part of those institutions. The Belgrade Declaration of the Non-Aligned Movement cautions feat ""there can be no stability  nor better prospects for the world without reducing the disparities in the level of global development"". We are hopeful reason will prevail to stave off a looming crisis that may engulf an important segment of mankind.The United Nations can be a useful forum for addressing the grievous nature of this problem  which encompasses virtually every area of life  including agricultural production  industry  economics  finance  trade  education  infrastructure  research  housing and health care. The world continues to seethe under the enduring effects of the thorniest areas of contention  despite the improvement in the international political climate.In the Middle East  the intifadah in occupied Palestine is now entering its twenty-second month with carnage  brutality and bloodshed continuing unabated. The Palestinians live in a precarious situation of perpetual risk. That the Palestinian problem as yet is not susceptible to dialogue or to a properly structured international conference simply attests to the dismal failure of international diplomacy. In our view all alternatives have been tried. In place of practical politicalaccommodation and early progress towards direct negotiations we ere saddened by the  infusion of yet another deliberate distraction and confusion by Mr. Shamir - this time a tailor-made election proposal which is nothing more than a fait accompli  a deception  indeed a prolongation of the ugly status quo. Naturally  it had to fall on its face. Thanks to Egyptian diplomatic dexterity  President Mubarak  looking for ways to keep the momentum alive  unveiled not an alternative to Shamir*s plan but a 10-point agenda to serve as the basis for comprehensive dialogue. It received wide support from Palestinians  the Israeli Labour Party and the United States Administration. By now  however  we are all aware of its fate; it has become the latest casualty  like the series of peace initiatives  plans and proposals in the past  of the so-called inner cabinet of the Israeli Government.Under the circumstances one doubts whether Israel will ever move in the direction of peace before violence destroys all prospects of peace. For now it seen* that the only viable policy option left for Israel  in the words of an Israeli Cabinet Minister  is one that promises the continuation of ""force  might and beatings"".The widening gulf of mistrust in the Middle East poses serious challenges to the easing of tensions between fee super-Powers. We urge the United States to use its considerable influence over Israel in order to place realistic limits on its recalcitrance. More and more  Israel has become impervious to international outcry and moral crusade  has become increasingly impervious to General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and decisions  and also to international pressures; it is content only in heaping up international wrath. On the contrary  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole representative of fee Palestinian people  has amply demonstrated to the world that it can be a credible partner in an international peace agreement. Its historic policy change embracing the cessation of ail hostilities and acceptance of the two-State principle based on relevant United Nations resolutions  required unequivocal reciprocity by Israel  in accepting the land-for-peace principle and restoring full political rights to the Palestinians  including the right to self-determination.It is ironic that the opening offered by the PLO should reinforce Israel's intransigence. We believe the PLO position offers a reasonable basis for fairness  equity and justice. Outright rejection of the notion of a Palestinian State is wholly unjustified. Pressing for more and more unilateral concessions by the PLO without corresponding flexibility on the part of Israel would not at all serve the cause of peace.In Lebanon  urban tank wars and artillery duels have taken their heavy toll on the helpless civilian population. Fourteen years of sectarian civil strife  compounded by proxy wars waged on its soil  have caused untold destruction and suffering and created confusion  division and anarchy. Lebanon's agony is bound to persist until Lebanese authority is fully restored. We fully endorse the initiatives of the Arab League Tripartite Com it tee for the restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity.We welcome the positive developments leading to the independence of Namibia. Nearly three decades of continuous diplomatic efforts to overcome the impasse have finally borne fruit  and Namibia will soon take its place among the free nations of the world. From the start of implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  numerous but inevitable set-backs were encountered: to mention a few  the menace of the Koevoet  the notorious counter-insurgency force  registration irregularity and the lack of secrecy of the ballot box. We however take pride at the reassurance by the South West Africa People's Organisation (SMAPO) of its commitment to peace  human rights and economic pragmatism. Such positive spirit of leadership will pave the way for a genuine national reconciliation.;In South Africa  the word ""change"" is being overplayed on the psyche and emotions of the black majority. The new President continues to assure his country and the world that an era of change lies ahead  whether this is posturing and mere style or a prelude to a fundamental reform programme  the coming months will tell. He has been associated with the introduction and defence of apartheid laws. will he now be the agent of change that the country deeply needs for the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  and negotiations with the African National Congress of South Africa (WO about a post-apartheid constitution? We are indeed sceptical about his commitment to deliver real change. South Africa remains a country beset by deep mistrust and divisions. Over 3 million black South Africans have been forcibly removed  thus causing intense suffering and social disruption. A common feature of apartheid is the redrawing of boundaries of tribal homelands resulting in deprivation and violent repression often associated with torture  beating and maiming.Much needs to be done  not least to translate De Klerk*s platitudes and ambiguities into a meaningful reform programme. It is inconceivable  so long as the reprehensible system of apartheid is in place  that it would be feasible to bring voteless blacks into government or even to build a new South Africa with full but unspecified political rights for the black majority.We strongly urge the scrapping of repressive measures and institutional racism  the end of undiluted minority rule  affirmation of political and economic rights and the creation of democratic institutions. When talking of change or hope  we cannot help reminding ourselves of the immortal prophecy of the late Alan Pa ton  that indefatigable literary giant and anti-apartheid activist who  over 30 years ago  wrote: ""South Africa is the kind of country where one is filled with hope on Monday only to be catapulted into utter despair on Tuesday"".With Mr. De Klerk  it is ""business as usual"" so far. In the absence of genuine and far-reaching reforms  the international community must continue to intensify its pressure for the total abolition of apartheid.The situation in the Gulf remains unpredictable and vulnerable. The peace process needs a new impetus. We are satisfied that  under the scrutiny of the United Nations peace-keeping forces  the cease-fire is holding and further reckless destruction of property and loss of precious lives have been thwarted. We deeply regret  however  the lack of progress towards the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The prevailing impasse of ""no peace and no war"" has dangerous implications for sustainable peace in the region  we believe that it is in the interests of both Iraq and Iran to demonstrate more readiness and flexibility to negotiate in good faith  so that the exchange of prisoners of war can proceed and important initiatives leading to the normalisation of relations can be undertaken. Djibouti had great hope that the Paris Conference on Kampuchea would bring an end to the conflict and tension  and pave the way for the restoration of full democratic rights to the people. There can be no enduring stability in South-East Asia until foreign forces are totally withdrawn and the Cambodian people is left to determine its own destiny freely. We urge  therefore  a comprehensive peace settlement to the Cambodian question. With respect to Western Sahara  we support the efforts of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity directed towards the search for a durable solution to the problem. We are a few months away from the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan and there are as yet no prospects for peace in sight. We believe that peace and tranquillity will continue to elude the Afghan people in the absence of a representative and popularly elected Government. As for the Korean peninsula  we are quite encouraged by the continuing dialogue between the two States  and hope that these exchanges will effectively contribute to an improvement in relations and further enhance the prospects for peaceful unification. In accordance with the principle of universality and consistent with the earnest desire to ease tensions in the peninsula  we support the admission of both Koreas  separately or simultaneously  to full membership of fee United Nations.Alarming environmental hazards pose or threaten to pose increasingly severe threats to the human condition and to our survival. We tend to treat environmental issues  such as degradation  resource depletion  hazardous solid wastes and pollution  as mere passing phenomena. Disasters like desertification  destruction of tropical rain forests  drought and famine have left a lasting impact in large parts of the world  particularly Africa. We are convinced that environmental issues cannot be separated from economic development  and that realization should provide fee desired impetus for a concerted  collaborative effort at every level. It was in response to that common concern that six countries in East Africa forged environmental unity by the establishment of the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought and Development (IGADD). Headquartered in Djibouti  IGADD is fast becoming a catalyst for the formulation of appropriate policies and projects in every member country. We wish to record our gratitude to the many countries and organizations feat continue to provide IGADD with direct institutional support and needed financial resources  In the view of our President  His Excellency Mr. Hassan Gouled Aptidon   ""The real enemies of men are not other men but rather hunger  disease  lack of water  homelessness and poverty"". Those priority basic human needs require far more serious attention and allocationof adequate resources.Despite satisfactory advances being made in all areas of development  Djiboutiis still poor and far from achieving many of its goals  unfavourable climatic conditions  declining economic activity  the constant influx of refugees  overstrained social services  and external constraints are some of the principal factors that militate against sound and steady progress. The destructive rainfalls and subsequent flooding that occurred earlier this year in Djibouti left behind heavy physical damage to vital infrastructures.We are deeply grateful to the friendly countries and organisations that- responded swiftly and generously with critically needed medical and relief supplies. We are confident that the international community will continue to support Djibouti's genuine development efforts.In conclusion  I wish to state that the Republic of Djibouti has a vital interest in peace and in helping to build up a climate of confidence in our part of the world. For a young nation  small and lacking in major resources  the maintenance of a reasonable degree of internal harmony and the pursuance off a realistic and prudent foreign policy go hand in hand. Our positive regional and international diplomacy will continue to be matched by pragmatic domestic policies."
"41",1910,"DMA",44,1989,"ï»¿I am privileged to be afforded this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Garba on his election to the office of President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly  secure in the knowledge that his vast and varied experience will serve to ensure a fruitful and constructive session.I would also like to express my delegation's appreciation and congratulations to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the able manner in which he presided over the forty-third session of the General Assembly.The Commonwealth of Dominica is a firm believer in the principles espoused and the goals pursued by the United Nations and its subsidiary agencies. We have been particularly heartened by the significant role played by the United Nations in the redaction of tension and the resolution of conflicts in the recent past. Foreign troops have departed from Afghanistan and Kampuchea  there is a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war  and preparations are under way for free elections in Namibia.It now remains for the people of Afghanistan and Kampuchea to resolve their internal conflicts and reach for that peace that has unfortunately eluded them for so long.The United Nations has been rediscovered  as it were  as a mediator  and that bodes well for the future of the Organization and for peace in the world. It demonstrates that this body can operate with some effectiveness once we abandon our contentious attitude and discard the ideological blinders that so often deter efforts to find solutions to the many problems confronting the international community today.My delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-General and his staff for the progress trade towards free elections in Namibia aid a foreseeable end to the domination of that country by South Africa. The struggle for free expression by all the peoples of southern Africa must  however  continue apace. We need not be reminded that a minority regime continues to dominate and repress the black majority in South Africa. We cannot take any comfort from the intimations of a President whose authority is validated by the evil that is apartheid and who  in the service of the white minority  is bent on the preservation and perpetuation of a system that is abhorrent to the civilized world. In the context of apartheid  gradualism is unacceptable. As long as apartheid exists we cannot  as Members of the United Nations  rest easy. That evil must be eradicated completely  and no effort should be spared in that regard.The Commonwealth of Dominica believes that only stringent  comprehensive and effective measures by all nations will force the minority Government in South Africa to heed the call for peaceful change to a society of men and women of all races freely participating in all facets of the affairs of their country.The immediate lifting of restrictions on the press  the end of the state of emergency  and the release of Nelson Mandela aid all other political prisoners would be  in our view  the preliminary indications of the Pretoria regime's intention in good faith to bring about the peaceful change desired by all people of good will.The extent of human rights abuses in various parts of the world is nothing short of appalling. Members of the Organization  in keeping with the relevant provisions of the Charter  have a duty to denounce any violation of human rights in the strongest possible terms. Adherence to and respect for the principles of the United Nations require every Member to speak up loudly against all human rights abuses  whether it is the brutal repression and massacre of students peacefully seeking democratic change in Asia or the indiscriminate killing of innocent women and children in local conflicts in Africa  Central America or elsewhere. We must untiringly work for a world where the fundamental rights of men and women everywhere are protected against abuse from the State.The Commonwealth of Dominica welcomes the new spirit of co-operation  openness and frequent discussion between the United States and the Soviet Union. The improvement in super-Power relations and its attendant lessening of tension in the world is an encouraging sign and we fervently hope the process  which has already led to a better climate for international peace and security  will continue  notwithstanding the immense obstacles posed by reactionary forces on both sides. One of the benefits of the new understanding is the recently signed Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and current proposals for further education about the stockpile of nuclear weapons  which is still unacceptable large. We dare to hope that one day the world will be free of the fear of nuclear war  but that hope is tempered by the alarming proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.The production and distribution of conventional weapons  ever increasing in sophistication and destructiveness  continue to cause problems for regional stability. The appetite for those weapons grows daily  especially in countries strapped for resources to provide the basic economic and social needs of their people. At a time when common sense should dictate a reordering of priorities  many nations irrationally opt for destruction rather than construction. As lamentable as that policy appears to be  there is little hope for its reversal as long as the preservation of power by a few takes precedence over the utilization of power for the good of the many.At this time every year we make mention of the dangerous state of instability in the Middle East. Division  mistrust end irrationality continues to fuel the conflicts in that area. The international community looks on helplessly as the State of Lebanon is destroyed. As we assemble here the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that once flourishing nation are being violated by the presence of foreign troops on its soil. Its capital city has been reduced to rubble by warring factions. The people of Lebanon deserve a better fate.Prospects for a solution to the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza appear bleak because the underlying issues have not been adequately and seriously addressed. Proclaiming the right of Israel to exist within secure boundaries is only half of an equation which also requires recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination end to a homeland. The question is forced upon us: does the international community lack the will  inclination or purpose of spirit to endeavour to find solutions to the problems of the Middle East  and are we relegated to the task of adopting resolutions  or even to matters like perennially querying the credentials of Israel  that prove meaningless to the people in that region  whose lives are destroyed on a daily basis?International terrorism continues to be a cons tent threat to the world aid we should recognize it in all its ugly disguises  so that we are the better able to deal with it effectively. Acts of terrorism violate the fundamental tenets of the civilized world community  threatening the democratic freedoms of all mankind. As Members of the United Nations we must band ourselves together to rid the world of this evil  taking every practical measure to conquer the terrorists no matter what their ideological stand.As with international terrorism  the scourge of illicit drugs must be of immediate concern to all Members of this body. No hope for a halt in the trade in illicit drugs can be entertained unless a concerted international effort  co-ordinated by the United Nations  is undertaken. The problem knows no boundary; it respects no ideology or power; it makes no distinction between rich and poor. North and South  East and West. Its engine is driven by the prospect of the huge fortunes capable of being amassed clandestinely and quickly. Nations which once connived at the production of illegal drugs for export have belatedly discovered the pain and misery of drug abuse among their own people.The Commonwealth of Dominica  like most Members of the Organization  has laws strictly prohibiting the production  distribution and use of illegal drugs. Punishment is swift and certain. But small countries like ours cannot hope to match the resources and organizational effort at the command of those engaged in this unwholesome activity and  from all appearances  a solution to the problem of illicit drugs is beyond the capacity of even the most well-endowed communities acting alone.Universal in its destructive force  the illegal drug problem presents a unique challenge to the world and an opportunity for co-operative action on an unprecedented scale. As Members of the United Nations we must accept the challenge  and for the sake of humanity we cannot fail to seize the opportunity here and now. Some matters which were of foremost importance 44 years ago have  in some instances  assumed less significance on the agenda  but essentially the United Nations must still make every effort to ensure that we live in a better world. And a better world encompasses a safe environment for all the inhabitants of this earth. The United Nations involvement in the identification of environmental problems and the search for solutions is commendable  but nations must all do more  both collectively and individually  to protect the environment in which we live.Depending on the economics of the situation  the origin of the problem takes different forms. Industrialized countries are confronted with huge amounts of deleterious waste resulting from the production of an expending variety of goods and services to meet the demands of their customer-driven societies  while the struggle for economic survival in third world countries unfortunately end unavoidably results in the depletion and destruction of ecological systems vital to the balance necessary for maintaining a safe environment. We believe that  given the present state of technology  economic and industrial development is not necessarily incompatible with a healthy environment  aid the development and implementation of programmes for the safe disposal of industrial waste should not be postponed indefinitely. As a complement to that effort we call for increased assistance to those countries which are lacking in the resources necessary for the protection and preservation of important ecological systems.Citizens of developing countries have the same right to a clean and safe environment as their counterparts in the industrialized world  and the cynical practice of inducing third-world countries to accept waste hazardous to the environment should cease. It is in the interest of all of us to take steps to protect the entire planet.I am convinced that unless we take a good hard look at ourselves at regular intervals we shall merely continue to meander along with no purpose  with no goal and a good deal of indecision. At a time of budgetary constraints the United Nations can ill afford to react to every whimsical suggestion of every Member State. There are  I believe  sufficient and adequate resolutions of this body on every issue - resolutions which  if implemented  would go a long way to curing the ills of the world. With courage  determination and purposeful commitment  we can make this earth a better and safer place for all its inhabitants. "
"42",1953,"DNK",44,1989,"ï»¿ I congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.  Your wide experience and diplomatic skills will no doubt be very valuable to us in our efforts to attain fruitful results in this session. The world today is a better place than it was last year  and it is changing rapidly. New challenges seem to emerge every day: old ones acquire new dimensions. Some conflicts continue to fester; but others  fortunately  are on the brink of peaceful solution.So  on balance  we can look to the future with optimism but not with complacency. Much remains to be done  and we are increasingly looking to the UN for assistance. It is against this background that he general assembly will have to address a number of international issues  including regional conflicts still in need of solution  the environmental challenge  the promotion of human rights  the debts problem  drugs and terrorism.  Speaking here I am particularly happy to note that the positive trend towards multilateralism continues. A growing number of member states avail themselves of the UN machinery in trying to solve regional and international conflicts. In Southern Africa the UN is playing a crucial role in Namibia's long overdue transition to independence. In Central America the UN is assuming ever more tasks. In other areas of conflict  such as Cyprus  Iraq-Iran and Western Sahara  the UN continues its steady efforts towards peaceful solutions. We welcome the fact that more and more Member States realize the urgent need to make it possible for the Organization to fulfil the role originally foreseen in the Charter by its founders.Full respect for the principle of universality is one important prerequisite  if the United Nations is fully to play this role. But it is also important to improve the practical application of the United Nations machinery  especially to make better use of the peace-keeping operations.Denmark remains a staunch supporter of the United Nations peace-keeping operations  as evidenced by our participation in most of them. Most recently Denmark placed a contingent at the disposal of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia (UNTAG).It is regrettable that the problems affecting the financing of peace-keeping activities - most notably the United Nations forces in Cyprus and Lebanon â have not been solved. Member States must recognize their collective responsibility for the financing of this essential work and demonstrate political will to meet their obligations.United Nations peace-keeping operations should be carried out effectively and with flexibility. They must be of a temporary nature and they must support political efforts aimed at achieving a final peaceful solution to the conflict in question. They must not become guardians of an unacceptable political status quo.Denmark will evaluate its contributions - present and future - to the peace-keeping operations on the basis of these factors: financing and effectiveness.But a solution must also be found to the financial problems of the United Nations in general. The United Nations can play a strong and effective role in meeting the global challenges of the 1990s only if the financial problems of the Organization are solved  it is encouraging that the financial situation has improved this year. But a durable solution requires that all Member states pay promptly and in full.With regard to the international situation much has been achieved in the relations between East and West over the past few years. We have seen a continuation of high-level meetings between the United States and the Soviet Union and a general intensification of the dialogue over the East-West divide.  More important  this positive develop seems to be acquiring a momentum of its own. I hope and trust that after having taken the most difficult first steps  we can now reach out for still more. We attentively follow the encouraging endeavours for change in the Soviet Union  Poland and Hungary  The reforms under way in these countries increase Prospects of intensified international collaboration in all spheres: in multilateral forums as well as in bilateral contacts.Denmark whole-heartedly welcomes this development. We are prepared to take on our share  nationally as well as in cooperation with other Western countries  to support and further encourage the reform process. We will do this through an intensified political dialogue and through a significant expansion of economic and commercial co-operation. We are faced with an historic development. We must all seize the opportunity to help bring about positive change  both for individual citizens and for the general situation in Europe in this context I wish to highlight one particular event: the successful conclusion of the follow-up feting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Vienna. Its concluding document provides a basis for important steps forward within all the areas covered. One of the most important results of the Vienna meeting is the prominent position now occupied by the human dimension in the CSCE process.I am convinced that the decision to convene a conference on this important aspect will prove to be a wise one. The Conference had a promising start in Paris this summer; and I very much hope that the meeting in Copenhagen next year will result in further progress to the benefit of East-West relations.Recent developments in the arms control and disarmament field have also been quite promising  prospects for real breakthroughs seem brighter now than ever before. The negotiations on conventional forces in Vienna came off to a good start. Although we do not underestimate the problems still ahead  we remain optimistic that an agreement on conventional armed forces in Europe can be worked out in the near future. Disarmament  however  is not the prerogative of the super-Powers - or of the European countries. Disarmament and the building of greater confidence and security is needed in all parts of the world. All Member States bear a responsibility. The United Nations can play a very important role in promoting disarmament world wide. However  if we wish the Organization to fulfil its role. Member States must act accordingly.Next year the Fourth Review Conference on the non-proliferation Treaty (NOT) will take place. The existence of a strong non-proliferation system has contributed to maintaining international peace and security during the last 20 years. This has been to the benefit of all countries - including those which have not yet signed the NOT. And the time has come for those countries  to acknowledge their responsibility and to join the Treaty.Negotiations over the last years on chemical weapons give rise to the hope that an agreement on a global ban can soon be concluded. All parties must participate whole-heartedly and constructively in these negotiations. We must not get lost in technical details but continue to keep the political goal of a global ban before us.And now  let me turn just briefly to some of the regional conflicts  in the Middle East the more constructive policy of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO) presented at last year's session of the General Assembly has brought new momentum to the peace process.However  the prevailing atmosphere of violence and the devastating mutual mistrust still represent serious obstacles to the establishment of security for all States and justice for all peoples in the area. The tragic situation in the occupied territories clearly demonstrates the need for all parties to exercise the utmost restraint. Confidence-building may be a slow and sometimes painful process requiring intensive efforts and courage  but it is necessary.Concrete steps must also be taken to get the peace process off the ground. The suggestion to hold elections in the territories occupied by Israel could bring the peace process forward if the elections are conducted under circumstances and guarantees acceptable to the Palestinians. The repressive measures taken by the occupying authorities in violation of international law must cease. Not only would such a step alleviate a serious humanitarian problem  it would also serve to reduce the atmosphere of mistrust. The tragic situation in Lebanon has recently deteriorated beyond the most Pessimistic predictions  it is our common responsibility to do our utmost to contribute to securing the independence  sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon. But the most urgent task is to ensure a stable and lasting cessation of hostilities and to attend to the basic needs of the Lebanese people on humanitarian grounds and impartially. We applaud and support the efforts of the Arab League to this end.Denmark deeply regrets that the international conference on Cambodia  in Paris  did not succeed in reaching an agreement on a lasting solution. We hope that all parties will show restraint  and we urge that all avenues be utilized to allow the people of Cambodia to exercise their right to self-determination and also to re-establish Cambodia as an independent  sovereign  neutral and non-aligned State.In southern Africa we have been greatly encouraged by the progress towards independence in Namibia through democratic and free elections. THIS historical development is not least a result of the tenacious AND dedicated efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative as well as the presence of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia.It is the firm hope of the Danish Government that the elections will lead to the formation of democratic institutions in Namibia in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We look forward to welcoming a free and independent Namibia as a member of the international community next year. In sharp contrast to the developments in Namibia  the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa has continued without significant changes. Many South Africans are still imprisoned for their political beliefs and activities. The state of emergency has this summer  once again  been prolonged. And the South African regime continues its flagrant violations of fundamental human rights. There is now - maybe more than ever - a crucial need for a national dialogue between all groups in South Africa.After the elections on 6 September we look to the new President to implement the urgently needed fundamental changes. Apartheid must be dismantled. We urge the new President to show wisdom and courage and to realize that nothing short of the total abolition of apartheid will meet the aspirations of the black majority. Until this goal has been reached the world community must continue to apply pressure  including economic sanctions  on the South African Government.One of the most urgent challenges facing mankind today is probably the global environmental problems. A proper response to the environmental challenges is of Paramount importance for development and for the survival of humanity. Our planet should not be regarded as an inheritance from past generations  but rather as a treasure held in trust for future generations.Scientists have clearly and convincingly demonstrated the threats to our environment posed by the depletion of the ozone layer  the greenhouse effect and other forms of environmental degradation  including deforestation and desertification. The world economic summit in July 1989 called for a determined and concerted international response to the environmental challenge. And for the early adoption world-wide of policies based on sustainable development. It was furthermore stated that environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade  development  energy  transport  agriculture and economic planning. Environmental issues will become an integral part of the economic decision-making process both at national and at international levels.Many of the processes already under way will be integrated in the preparations for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. It is imperative that the Conference both define the sources of environmental degradation and underdevelopment and agree on concrete actions to deal with the major environmental issues.Participating Governments must make political commitments to act individually and together to restore the global environment. The transfer of appropriate technology and additional financial resources to the poorer developing countries will be essential if those countries are to participate actively in this global effort.As a follow-up to the recommendations in the Environmental Perspective and in the Brundtland report  Denmark has adopted a comprehensive national action plan and a specific action plan for development co-operation.In meeting the environment challenge we must not lose sight of other basic problems facing the developing countries in particular. The debt problem is among the most prominent. During the past year new steps have been taken to deal with that issue. the IMF and the WB have approved support for the reduction of private debt and service of highly indebted middle-income countries. These decisions constitute an important development. The success of the arrangements depends to a large extent on the willingness of commercial banks to agree to significant debt reduction and  in many cases to provide new money as well. This would be in their own interest as well as in the interest of the indebted developing countries. It is recognised that severely indebted low-income countries need concessional debt relief. We welcome the implementation of the Paris Club concessional rescheduling terms agree at the Toronto summit.  We also welcome the decision of several creditor countries  including two of the largest ones  to waive the official debt of low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally  we note with satisfaction the decision of the WB to allocate $US 100 million of its net income to the support of debt reduction efforts in countries that receive only international development assistance. Solving the debt problem is important  but more aid of good quality is very much needed as well. Denmark  together with the other Nordic countries  has recently urged all donor countries to take certain concrete steps to achieve as soon as possible the United Nations objective of .7 per cent  an objective Denmark has already met  seven years ago  as we expect to reach the 1 per cent goal in 1992.Promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination continues to be one of the basic obligations of the United Nations. Over the years the United Nations has developed a considerable number of conventions on human rights. Our main task today is to ensure their full implementation. All countries are unconditionally obliged to respect human rights in accordance with the Charter and the conventions to which they have freely acceded. Human rights are by nature universal. They should not be given different meanings or interpretations in various regions of the world. The global society has the right - even the duty - to see the individual and respect for his rights as a relevant concern.Human rights take a natural and central place also in development co-operation. Each individual's possibilities of influencing his or her own situation have to be taken into account. Only then can we expect a development process to become truly sustainable - and humane. My Government sincerely believes that promotion of the democratisation process should become fully integrated into the development strategies of the coming years. I trust that international agencies for development assistance will also give due consideration to human rights issues. During this year we have witnessed a serious escalation in the illicit drug traffic. Still-more-sophisticated methods are being employed by the drug merchants  leaving States and the international community with no alternative but to combat this evil. The machinery is at hand to attack this global problem. The international community's response should be firm and coordinated  leaving our adversaries in no doubt that they will be apprehended  prosecuted and punished and  if necessary  extradited to a State where prosecution will take place. There must be no safe haven for drug terrorists. Every few months the world community continues to receive reports about new terrorist incidents. My Government urges the Assembly to stand united in its condemnation of these criminal acts wherever and by whomever committed and to encourage intensified international cooperation at all levels in this field.It is not always easy to recognize the importance of international events as they unfold. Many factors are at play and the outcome of their interaction is often only appreciated years later. By now I think many would agree that we are entering a new era in international politics. People in many regions of the world are becoming more aware of their democratic rights. And many Governments are introducing domestic reforms to meet popular demand. Governments and individuals are becoming increasingly aware of the interdependence of the community of nations and hence of the need to find common solutions to our common global problems.I am not saying that the future is without dangers. Regional conflicts - such as those in the Middle East and southern Africa - pose a threat not only to the peoples of those regions but to us all. But the general trend of positive change must be seized to tackle the problems before us. We must intensify our efforts to solve the various serious regional conflicts. We must encourage the trend towards democracy in many parts of the world and undertake all possible endeavours to promote and protect human rights. We must spare no effort to solve the economic Problems of the developing countries. We must pool our resources to eliminate poverty and illiteracy. We must accelerate the process of disarmament  not only in Europe but in all parts of the world. We must fight the scourges of terrorism and narcotic drugs. We must act swiftly - before it is too late - to save our environment for future generations. We must do all this - and much more.When I consider the many positive developments since I spoke from this rostrum a year ago  I am optimistic about our possibilities for progress. But we must act together  and act now."
"43",1998,"DOM",44,1989,"ï»¿It is a great honour and pleasure for me to return to this rostrum for the forty-fourth session of the Assembly and to address it on behalf of my country  the Dominican Republic.It is also a matter of great satisfaction to me to convey to Mr. Joseph Nanven Garba the warm congratulations of the Dominican Government  and of our delegation in particular  on his well-deserved election to the presidency of this great gathering. I look forward confidently to his complete success in this sensitive undertaking inasmuch as he is a skilled and seasoned diplomat from a region which is undergoing a steady process of growth and development - a fact that can be observed in the importance and the scope of the Convention concluded between the European Economic Community and the African  Caribbean aid Pacific States  better known as the lome Convention  the progress of which we have been following in our country with much interest and with a great feeling of solidarity. His outstanding personal qualities will ensure that the work and the deliberations of this session will be guided with due deliberation and the highest aims. In this respect  he can count on our resolute co-operation.This is a suitable opportunity to express our high esteem for that outstanding Argentine internationalist  Mr  Dante Caputo  for his exemplary guidance of the work of the last session.On this solemn occasion we should like to place on record our great appreciation and admiration for the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the valuable  timely and unstinting work that he has been doing to promote peace and understanding among the peoples and nations of the Earth.At the beginning of my statement I should like to thank the representatives for their attention to lay sincere message of goodwill from a part of the globe that has been called upon to play a major role from the time of the arrival in the New World of the visionary  the admiral of the seas Christopher Columbus  a portentous event that changed the course of history.Hispaniola has had the honour of having its capital Santo Domingo  as the headquarters of the first administrative  religious  cultural  scientific and economic institutions of the American continent.Fran this confluence of cultures  ethnic groups  customs and traditions on Hispaniola  the first voices were raised in defence of the indigenous races  which formed a new and juridical concept of equality and justice among human beings  through jus gentium  the law of nations  in which one can find the true roots of modern international law  and as a result  the distant origins of the international bodies designed to ensure the observance and effectiveness of the inherent rights of the human person.Under that auspicious beacon  in this lofty body in which all the nations of the world are represented with their own particular characteristics  we are again meeting in a yearly pilgrimage to find peace. But this ideal  which is so difficult to express in specific terms  cannot be fully achieved unless it is by means of open and respectful  but firm and conclusive  dialogue  with a view to putting an end to terrorism and drug trafficking  in whatever form or under any pretext.It is natural that any undertaking directed towards limiting the arms race and eliminating deadly weapons should be seen as a comforting and encouraging example. That is the case with respect to the agreement on the limitation of strategic weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union  which was jointly announced by Secretary of State James Baker and Minister for Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze. Special mention should be made of the plan proposed at this session of the General Assembly by the President of the United States  Mr. George Bush  to rid the Earth of the scourge of chemical weapons  a proposal that was welcomed by the Soviet Union. These positive steps  which demonstrate the will of both super-Powers to reduce the causes of tension and disagreement  will have a favourable impact on world politics in the coming years.Once again  I should like to recall that the Dominican Republic  a Caribbean nation  is aware that its development is indissolubly linked to that of our neighbour  Haiti  and of the other countries of the area. Our trade with those countries had been minimal despite the geographic -  ethnic  historic and economic bonds that unite us. Hence our Government has begun an energetic movement towards integration with our Caribbean brothers  since we are fully convinced that it is only by means of joint  united efforts that we shall achieve the goals that will bring us full development for our peoples.With regard to the tragic situation in Central America  our country reiterates that it is interested in co-operating in the search for a speedy and most fitting solution of this conflict. We categorically support the agreements that have been entered into in the search for peace by the five Central American Presidents â the Esquipulas II Agreements and the Playa del Tesoro Declarations - aimed at achieving a peaceful negotiated solution to the Central American crisis. The recent Tela presidential summit demonstrates that there is hope that peace can be achieved  for peace is the essential prerequisite for the solution of the political  economic and social problems of the region.The Dominican Republic has noted with particular interest the events occurring throughout Africa  not only because of its impact on international policies  but also because the African race is part of our own ethnic and cultural substratum. We stand in solidarity with the African peoples and participate in efforts to solve their problems  which are similar to those facing all developing countries. The situation in southern Africa continues to be explosive  with unforeseeable consequences for peace and security in the area; its prolongation has an impact on international stability.Security Council resolution 435 (1978) contains the basic elements for a just and lasting solution of the question of Namibia. For almost 20 years the South African apartheid regime has been illegally occupying the Territory  in defiance of all the relevant United Nations resolutions. We defend Namibia's fundamental right to self-determination. The delegation of the Dominican Republic believes that the system of government in South African breeds violence  injustice  oppression  inequality and discrimination - in other words  everything that flies in the face of the ideals behind the founding of the United Nations. The eradication of apartheid and independence for Namibia will create the necessary conditions for a return to peace in southern Africa. We call for the cessation of the growing hostilities between Syrian forces and Lebanese Christian soldiers. Despite this escalation  the efforts for peace that have begun recently give us hope for a definitive solution of the conflict.The situation in the Middle East  which is of great concern to all nations of the world  has a direct impact on Dominicans  because among our ethnic groups there are many people with Palestinian  Syrian  Arab and Israeli roots  with the resultant influence they bring to our national life.The Dominican Republic has been concerned for several years about the situation in the Korean peninsula. Our country has supported the view that Korean affairs must be solved peacefully by means of dialogue between the two Koreas. The Republic of Korea must be admitted to membership in the United Nations in keeping with the principle of universality. Its entry into the Organization would contribute to reducing tension and promoting peace in north-eastern Asia. The Dominican Republic has viewed favourably the formula for the unification of the Korean community that was proposed recently by the Government of the Republic of Korea to promote peaceful coexistence between the south and the north of Korea.The serious and tragic situation in many developing nations makes it imperative for us urgently to adopt effective and concrete measures to improve the living conditions of millions in the third world. The presence in this important gathering of a growing number of Heads of State or Government from those countries is clear proof of the world-wide interest and expectations regarding the results and conclusions of this session  which has also brought together representatives of the most powerful and developed countries of the world.The situation of the nations of the third world is so critical and paradoxical that their economies are constantly stagnating or actually deteriorating. There will be no improvement until more favourable conditions are provided for access by our export products to the developed countries' markets. If that goal is achieved  and if the developing countries receive better treatment in negotiations regarding their external debt from the creditor nations and entities  we shall have an opportunity  with the impetus of this necessary co-operation  to embark energetically and optimistically upon the path of our development.Thus  it is obvious that the solution to the general problem of the external debt cannot be achieved with the ways and means that have been used to date  since in most cases they do not allow for economic growth and therefore subject peoples to impoverishment and social upheaval.The international community  aware of the intricate nature of this problem  which is not merely economic in nature  recognizes that the United Nations has the competence to seek a solution in the political sphere.The position of the Dominican Republic was defined graphically by His Excellency Mr. Joaquin Balaguer  the President of the Dominican Republic  in his speech at the opening meeting of the Twelfth Annual Conference on Investment  Trade and Development  held in Miami  in the United States  in November of 1988. He said: ""The goal set forth in Berlin for the third-world countries is not to pay the public debt but  above all  to achieve sustained economic growth and an increase in per-capita income that will guarantee our dispossessed masses the right to eat  to clothe themselves  to educate their children and to live under a decent roof. In other words  the third-world countries face two challenges - not one  as was said in Berlin. The first is to live; the second  to pay"".Since terrorism continues to affect all nations to such a degree and with such tragic and disastrous consequences  sowing fear and insecurity  a strong  internationally co-ordinated plan must be adopted to combat it more firmly and thereby ensure its eradication. One of the most criminal and frequent forms of terrorist action is the attacks against passengers  flights and airports. Such attacks are increasingly stirring the universal conscience.The Dominican Republic strongly condemns the subversive activities of international terrorism  which is carried out indiscriminately against mothers  innocent children and the ill - in other words  against life itself  the most precious thing we own.The alarming problem of drugs has reached such dimensions  it terms both of production and of trade and consumption  that our delegation wishes to place it on record that the Dominican Government is struggling with all the means in its power to deal with this social evil that is spreading like a flood. For that purpose our courts have been imposing increasingly severe sentences on drug traffickers. Publicity has been given to this throughout the country with a view to ensuring that drug users and traffickers are aware of it and that people understand the evil and disastrous consequences of this illegal trade.We also give our moral support to the battle which is being waged by countries throughout the continent and whose development we are following with great interest.At this difficult historical time of conflict  with acute  burning problems that I have mentioned in this statement - to which my colleagues in the Assembly have been good enough to listen with attention - there have been signs of detente and an improvement in international relations above and beyond diverse criticism or positions. I should like to express on behalf of the Government that I have the honour of representing and on my own behalf  our fervent desire to see concrete form given to the ideals and principles that led to the establishment of the world Organization  in which mankind has placed its hopes for a better future in which the ethical and spiritual values that underlie our civilization prevail."
"44",2045,"DZA",44,1989,"ï»¿   Mr. President  the delegation of Algeria welcomes your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. I have no doubt that in elevating you to this exceedingly demanding post the General Assembly was acknowledging your well-known personal merits and professional abilities.The Assembly  thus  also pays a well deserved tribute to brotherly Nigeria for its remarkable contribution to the complete liberation of Africa  and particularly to its commitment to the struggle against apartheid. A united Africa  bound in solidarity  is itself honoured by this tribute to your country. Sir  precisely at a time when it is committed to the final phase of the elimination of colonialism. Your predecessor as President  Mr. Dante Caputo  carried out his responsibilities in a manner which has rightly earned him the congratulations of all the members of the Assembly today. We join in the unanimous expression of congratulations to him.The whole international community is indeed grateful to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who  as the embodiment of the unique role of the United Nations  has made praiseworthy efforts towards the attainment of peace and development whenever circumstances have required.Relations between the two super-Powers have entered a new phase one of dialogue and mutual consultations. The conclusion of the first treaty on nuclear disarmament - the agreement on intermediate-range nuclear forces - marked both the effective start of that process and its first achievement. World peace can only gain from the transformation of the ideological and military rivalry between the two blocs into a relationship of partners who significantly contribute to the establishment of a genuine international front for world peace.It is also encouraging that inflexible attitudes generated by the cold war are now beginning to yield to dialogue. That is most promising for our common future  but further efforts are required. My country reaffirms its commitment to that concept of world peace  which should be universal and global in its approach. Shared development requires extended and universal co-operation. Common peace calls for common efforts.While recognizing the influence of European security on world security  we should now become aware of the partial nature of security confined to Europe  while the demands of the integration and complementarity of civilizations require that the legitimate security interests of the southern Mediterranean non-aligned countries be taken into account.Regional mechanisms are often capable of formulating lasting solutions to local conflicts. When regional efforts fail  however  such conflicts must receive the sustained attention of the international community. The United Nations provides the ideal  irreplaceable framework in which just and genuine solutions can be found.The Non-Aligned Movement works constantly to promote that common  global enterprise  as it did recently in Belgrade. Present developments in international relations provide the fullest justification of its message.Our Movement intends to play its proper role in the current changes. It is clearly unacceptable that a few should claim the dominant part in the necessary repainting of the international landscape while the vast majority of mankind are confined to being passive spectators.Algeria is aware of the contribution that each country must make in building a common peace and strengthening co-operation. It is in the African and Arab spheres to which it naturally belongs that Algeria is making its resolute contribution  which we hope will be significant as an act of faith and by virtue of the results it can produce. Ever since the first Mahgreb Summit  held in Zeralda in Algeria which gathered the regional Heads of State  the Arab Maghreb has resolutely assumed its commitment to the common destiny of the peoples of the region. Since then  despite the changing international climate  objectives have come into focus and resources have been organized to meet the challenge of the future and show the way to a union that is based on a common heritage of civilization.Given the scope of the enormous challenges  there can be no doubt that the building of the Mahgreb.- can only greatly benefit by a peaceful  just and lasting settlement of the question of Western Sahara. Therefore  Algeria profoundly welcomes the acceptance  last year  by Morocco and the POLISARIO Front of the joint proposals of the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General of the United Nations  seeking to ensure the free and authentic exercise by the Sahraoui people of its right to self-determination and independence.BIt is also a source of satisfaction to my country that the peace dialogue between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front  a dialogue that Algeria has always advocated and fervently supported  reached a historic turning-point with the meeting last January between His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco and the leaders of the POLISARIO Front. We firmly believe that the continuation of that dialogue will be decisive in ensuring that the two brotherly and neighbourly peoples confidently go forward and contribute significantly to the building of the Arab Mahgreb. All parties encourage this dialogue and hope that the process will lead to the referendum on self-determination that the United Nations and the OAU are preparing to organize in Western Sahara.As concerns the mandate entrusted to them by the General Assembly  the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General of the United Nations know that they can count on my country's support in the fulfilment of their peace mission. I wish  again today  to reaffirm that commitment.In that spirit and with the same conviction  we have worked unceasingly to ensure the full restoration of brotherly relations and understanding between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the Republic of Chad. My country was thus most satisfied to see that those two neighbouring countries have sealed their rapprochement through the agreement signed on 31 August in Algiers. By this historic completion of a process  which has been perseveringly and fraternally supported by Algeria the two sister countries have resolved to open the path to a future of good-neighbourly relations  friendliness and co-operation.I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute here to the tireless efforts of the Adjtoc Committee of African Heads of State for that success  which is a success for all Africa. Africa as a whole is entitled to rejoice today over the new era of harmony now initiated between the peoples of Chad and Libya  thus releasing renewed common energy with which to meet the numerous challenges facing the continent.There is no greater challenge for Africa than that posed by the apartheid regime in all its dimensions - the racist dimension in South Africa  the colonial in Namibia  and the destabilizing in southern Africa.The Namibian people  which for decades has fought a liberation struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  is preparing to rejoin the community of independent nations. However  the international community  which has constantly supported that struggle  must not lower its guard at this crucial stage  when South Africa is trying to disrupt the fair and genuine electoral process envisaged by the international community.The United Nations is therefore duty-bound constantly to exert all efforts to ensure the untrammelled implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the free expression of sovereign will of the Namibian people.In the same vein  if  as it appears  under the combined pressures of the international community  South Africa has yielded to the inevitability of Namibian independence  we must now redouble our efforts to bring about the collapse of the bulwark of racism in southern Africa. Only then will all the countries of southern Africa be able to enjoy the stability and peace necessary for the development to which they aspire.As in Namibia  where it is the best guarantor of genuine independence  the United Nations continues to be the most suitable framework for a just and lasting settlement of the Middle East problem. Today  more than ever  the core of that conflict  the Palestinian question  cannot be overlooked. Despite the repression and oppression inflicted on it daily by the Israeli occupying forces  the Palestinian people through its heroic intifadah has demonstrated that it is willing to pay the price in order to recover all its rights  including the inalienable right to build its own State on its liberated homeland.Proclaimed in Algeria a year ago  the birth of that State was immediately hailed and recognized by a majority of nations AS an inevitable  legitimate  fitting and timely response to the national aspirations of the Palestinian people. In that connection  there can be no just and lasting settlement without the satisfaction of the national rights of the Palestinian people  nor any viable alternative to an international conference having the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on an equal footing with all parties.In Lebanon  another Arab people has endured a dreadful tragedy  which has aggravated an already heavy toll of death and destruction.That fratricidal conflict has none the less not lessened the faith of the Lebanese in the rebuilding of their country once they have attained freedom and national reconciliation. Inspired by that same faith  the Tripartite Committee  consisting of President Chadli Benjedid  of the Custodian of the Two Holy Sites of Islam  King Fahd Ibn Abdelaziz  and of His Majesty King Hassan II  has worked with resolve to ensure that Lebanon recovers its unity  independence and sovereignty.The comprehensive and definitive cease-fire that has just been established has opened the way to a brotherly dialogue and will make possible a definitive settlement of the Lebanese crisis in all its aspects. That was the objective of the Tripartite Committee  which has mobilized all its efforts  engaged in numerous contacts  explored all possibilities  and contacted all parties  neglecting or belittling none and favouring none. Algeria hopes that battered Lebanon will withstand the trials inflicted upon it  so that all its sons  in an upsurge of national patriotism  can restore the country's institutions and unity.My country is glad to see that the conflict between Iraq and Iran is among those which have seen a distinct appeasement. Algeria hopes for a consolidation of the current cease-fire in order to promote dialogue in mutual respect and in the mutual interests of the parties. In that respect  the Secretary-General of our Organization has our full support for the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) .In Central America  the Tela meeting has confirmed the will of the peoples of the region to work together towards regional peace and security. The process thus set in motion  involving an active contribution from the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States  deserves the support of those who have it within their power to act in order to secure its successful outcome.In Afghanistan  Algeria hopes to see the Geneva Accords fully and completely implemented  so that national reconciliation will eventually prevail and so that the independence and non-alignment of that country may be maintained. The gradual elimination of the nuclear threat  which is most certainly a vital objective  should not cause us  however  to overlook the necessity to combat underdevelopment  the breadth and tragic depth of which can also pose a threat of worldwide conflagration.While the developed countries have overcome their difficulties and are moving ahead towards new prospects of economic and technological over-development  economic deterioration continues to have devastating effects on the living standards of the peoples in our countries  which are already relegated to a marginal status. On the one hand  the present international economic system has evolved the mechanisms by which it operates to the interest of the sustained development of some parties. On the other hand  it has maintained the underdevelopment of others who are now in a situation of virtual  if not outright  economic  social and political disruption.The unceasing deterioration of the terms of trade has already aggravated the paradoxical phenomenon of the net transfer of resources from the poorer to the richer countries. It is well known today that  far from producing the promised positive effects  economic prosperity in the developed countries has in fact generated a new situation characterized by the disintegration of certain complementary bonds which would have constituted the economic link between North and South.Because of the absence of appropriate and timely treatment  third world indebtedness is now reaching a threshold that leaves no room for hope for future economic growth. The debt burden is exhausting all reserves  including those needed for everyday life. The measures taken by the developed countries  though conceived with praiseworthy intentions  have been too few and too late.The use of narcotics has spread to such an extent as to cause keen concern over the very future of many societies. Although the spread of the use of narcotics has taken place essentially within the more developed consumer societies  Algeria  as a member of the international community  conscious of the bonds which unite us all  feels directly concerned by the threat of the social and ecological disaster inherent in the spread of narcotics utilization and trafficking. Algeria therefore hails the courageous endeavour engaged in by Colombia  and washes to express its sympathy and solidarity towards all other major initiatives designed to wage relentless war against the use of and trafficking in narcotics.My country  which signed the Vienna Convention as soon as it had been adopted  wishes to place on record once again its willingness to continue to contribute to the struggle against a phenomenon that truly afflicts the international community as a whole.Having faith in a future which we shall build together  my country reaffirms its dedication to the strengthening of the incipient dialogue and to the spread of its benefits. From this point of view  the United Nations continues to be an efficient instrument for the implementation of our collective will. Our hope is that it will gain unanimous confidence in its vocation to co-ordinate our common efforts so that this session may be a fine opportunity to look forward to a promising future."
"45",2092,"ECU",44,1989,"ï»¿The Government of Ecuador would like to extend to Ambassador Joseph Garba its warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His country and mine have shared interests and shared aspirations  and we are confident of his skills in guiding the debates of this General Assembly.I should also like to express our gratitude to Ambassador Dante Caputo for the efficient manner in which he presided over the proceedings of this Assembly's session last year.It is now ten years since democracy was re-established in Ecuador and a year since President Rodrigo Borja assumed his constitutional mandate. During this period the Ecuadorian people have strengthened their political system and have made serious efforts to surmount the economic difficulties encountered.The Administration has been forced to adopt stringent measures to streamline its economy  honour its international commitments and attempt to improve the social circumstances of its poorest citizens. So far it has managed to launch a sustained process of stabilization and economic recovery and to lay the foundations for social development in a climate of freedom  security  peace  respect and democratic discipline.We have made special efforts to broaden our role in international affairs by strengthening our relations both with industrialized and with developing countries. We are convinced that co-operation and solidarity are essential to development and the harmonious coexistence of nations.We are conscious also of the reality in which we live and of the regional commitments to give a new dimension to Latin American and Caribbean unity and in this context to work for Andean and Latin American integration and co-operation between Amazonia and the South Pacific. Ecuador shares problems and positions with the third world and with the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We hope the twenty-first century will see Latin America united  enjoying solidarity  and truly integrated  with a system of collective security that will make confrontation between nations inconceivable and proscribe violence  it is our hope that mutual trust will set the region on a course which will allow all of the countries  individually and collectively  to have sound possibilities of development. In the Andean region we have taken significant steps to consolidate a process of integration  which will promote progress in trade  political  economic and social affairs  as well as in the technological  scientific and cultural areas.We have given impetus to a good-neighbour policy aimed at improving links with the neighbouring countries of Colombia and Peru  through an effective  straight-forward mechanism which enables us to strengthen our affinities and take advantage of the possibilities of co-operation and complementation. The process that we have under way with Peru will create the climate and conditions necessary to enable our countries  in a spirit of brotherly collaboration  to make joint efforts to promote their people's development and solve their traditional difference on a renewed basis of justice  trust and friendship  in a new era of fruitful bilateral relations. We have also strengthened our relations and intensified our action in multilateral forums because we believe that the discussions and activities of the international community will help significantly to solve our national problems. I would like here to reiterate my Government's tribute e to the United Nations and its support for the Organization and to express our thanks to its specialized agencies  which are doing so much to help us surmount our development problems.As a member of the international community we are undoubtedly living in hopeful times. However  the threat of confrontation has not been eliminated  nor has a solution been found to all regional conflicts. Nor can we claim victory in our fight against poverty or sickness. We cannot yet say that we are close to the time when all the peoples of the United Nations will have attained living standards consistent with human dignity. Nor can we claim that we have completely eliminated friction or dangerous misunderstandings or that violence has been eradicated. There are still many serious problems  but there are also undoubtedly positive signs which we should reinforce. It is obvious that a new spirit of detente makes dialogue and co-operation easier. Several conflicts that only yesterday represented a serious threat to peace now appear to be giving way to constructive negotiations.Thus  we welcome this rebirth of hope. We enthusiastically support the renewed spirit of peace  the steps taken towards the elimination or reduction of weapons of mass destruction and the perspectives for closer understanding within a framework that should lead to greater solidarity between nations and to the establishment of a fairer international order. The united Nations has made an essential and extremely valuable contribution to all those efforts. In order to overcome the remaining pockets of tension  however  we will have to undertake more vigorous and dynamic action. The fundamental task of maintaining and strengthening peace is everybody's business  it has to be undertaken by the great Powers as well as the small countries  by Governments as well as individuals. Peace is the business of humanity as a whole.Agreement  as a road to coexistence  is an urgent goal to be achieved at the international level. Thus  we welcome the rapprochement between the United States and the Soviet Union and we trust that its consolidation will strengthen the hopes of agreement and harmony  and thus reduce the tensions both between the super-Powers and at the level of regional conflicts. We welcome also the progress made in our region towards a negotiated solution to the Central American crisis. With genuine political will  momentous political steps are being taken. We trust that all the Governments that are parties to the Escruipulas II and Tela Agreements will abide by the commitments they have assumed  and that all members of the inter-American community will do their best to facilitate the achievement of the goals of peace and the democratization process  and will refrain from anything that might hinder it. We also welcome the efforts to establish a dialogue aimed at bringing to an end the conflict in El Salvador  which has already cut short too many lives and severely undermined that country's development.In Latin America we cannot be indifferent to what is happening to the political system of other countries in the region. We are quite aware that the persistence of totalitarian regimes  the temptation of military takeovers  the continued existence of guerrilla movements  irregular forces and different forms of terrorism ultimately affect the security of all. We are beginning to experience democratic interdependence in Latin America  which is thoroughly consistent with our deep respect for the principle of non-intervention.Hence  those of us who support and promote a negotiated political solution among all the sectors involved in the Panama crisis believe that the dialogue among the parties  which was interrupted by an artificially set. date that had established an absurd time-limit  should be resumed so that Panamanians can arrive at a Panamanian formula that will bring about the beginning of a legitimate  fully democratic process leading to the establishment of a constitutional government.Our desire for peace leads us to promote any process aimed at achieving and strengthening peace and points to the need to find negotiated solutions to all disputes  we have always given proof of this. We believe that all of us must make fairness a universal value so that the vital interests of each nation  be it big or small  will be equally valid and internationally respected.The independence of Namibia will represent monumental progress on the part of the international community in its struggle to eradicate colonialism. The civilized world requires that some of the encouraging statements that have been heard lately find real expression in the eradication of the abhorrent apartheid system and other equally unacceptable discriminatory practices. We also hope that the goals of negotiation and reconciliation set for the Middle East region will be achieved. This is a region with which we Latin Americans feel historically linked - as we do with all other areas of persistent conflict - although in the last year there have been significant steps towards a resolution. This is  in any case  the time for us to realize that the risks are not merely military but have very tragic political  social and economic dimensions. We must look towards the establishment of a safer world for everyone.  The lack of security in the world at large  and in Latin America in particular  has many deep-rooted causes. Among them are the violence in the large urban centres  the difficult situation of the peasants  the deterioration of the environment and quality of life  poor working conditions and low pay  the stifling practices of those who wield financial power  food imbalances and unmet health needs  and the lack of opportunity for the young to use their imagination and energy. They are also to be found in the failure to make the unfair international order more democratic  and in lack of respect for human rights and the sovereignty of nations through unjustified interference.An insecure society leads to frustration  conflict and violence. Our most urgent task and social obligation in Latin America is to make democracy a practical reality for the disadvantaged in our societies. Historically  the effectiveness of our democracy will be measured by its ability to bring tangible relief and benefits to more than 130 million human beings in Latin America living in really unacceptable conditions.In some nations poverty has reached levels that were deemed impossible in Latin America. Forty per cent of the population of the region lives below the poverty line. Poverty is the single main cause of death on our continent  we need the kind of development that will eradicate the roots through permanent political solutions. Next year Ecuador will host the Second Regional Conference on Dire Poverty  and we believe that it is essential to reach genuine agreement and a firmcommitment by all our countries and all their social sectors  as well as by the countries of the industrialized north and international agencies for technical co-operation. President Borja has expressed throughout his political life - and certainly since he came into office - his deep concern for children. We has said that during his Administration the needs of children will be his main priority. Children are the silent victims of societies in crisis and of underdevelopment. Child mortality rates are tragically high and  although revolutionary methods have been devised to reduce them  too many children are dying of avoidable causes. Accordingly  my Government supports the Convention on the Rights of the Child  which is based on an international consensus and commitment. Ecuador also supports enthusiastically the convening of a meeting of Heads of State to mobilize at the highest level efforts aimed at safeguarding the lives and dignity of children. Let us be clear: our developing countries  especially in Latin America  have seen during this decade their material  economic and social progress con. to a halt. That is why Enrique Iglesias has called it the lost decade. Per capita income and production have fallen while inflation  unemployment and poverty have increased  giving rise to a protracted crisis that represents the main challenge to our democracy.The situation in Latin America is mostly expressed in terms of economic deficits and debt-servicing difficulties. But these debts are not just the result of our mistakes and problems. They also reflect an unfair system of international economic relations. Clearly  there is a shared responsibility for their genesis and  hence  their solution requires an equal sharing of responsibilities and costs.It is true that in recent months there has been an evolution of thought as to the origins of the problem  and it is now accepted that it is necessary to lighten the developing nations' debt burden in keeping with their needs for growth and social progress. The recognition of the joint responsibility of creditors and debtors has found pragmatic expression in the Brady plan. Its implementation  however  does not offset the accumulated damage of almost a decade and implies negotiations with international banks that seem to have hardened their positions based on earlier experience. In this context  it is relevant to point out that during the recent visit of the President of Ecuador to Madrid  the Government of Spain  in a joint statement  indicated its willingness to consider a reduction of Ecuador's public debt. I believe this is the first time that a Government has formally expressed such an intention. I mention this because  in our view  this is an extremely important step in the efforts to bring about a change of attitude in the way this serious problem is being dealt with.The elimination or sizeable reduction of financial flows and investment have led to increased stagnation and generated a vicious circle resulting in the maintenance of restrictions which hamper development and  consequently  undermine the ability to repay.  In international trade - the other main source of economic recovery - it is necessary to abandon protectionist practices that continue to hamper the growth efforts of developing countries  as well as the possibility of their overcoming their vulnerability and dependence.If we mention the international climate and its impact on the development of the debtor countries  this does not mean shirking our own responsibility to overcome our probes and achieve a better standard of living  certainly we expect understanding and cooperation from the international community and certainly it - urgent to reform an international order that impedes our progress and perpetuates injustice. But  equally  we know that it is our responsibility to build societies that can guarantee  at the donation level  those conditions that we expect of the democratic course that we have chosen: Justice with freedom  respect for man  and development.Domestic efforts to achieve economic recovery have a political cost but there has to be a limit to the sacrifice. Medicine is intended to cure the patient  not to kill him or compound his condition. That is why we raise our voices against protectionist measures that frustrate cur dances of growth. We call for fresh investment  and we call on creditor banks to accept the reality prevailing in the debtor countries.If the pressure of the external debt is relieved  and financial liquidity restored  progress will be made towards opening the economies of small countries without the risk of destabilization. Develop options can be preserved in such a way that the State fulfils an adequate role by stimulating and guiding the forces Of production. To that end  it is necessary to have well-defined rules of the game that protect national interests and instil confidence in all those who take part in the production process by sullying their work  capital or technology. Together   they will bring about harmony and efficiency in the process of economic revitalization  wealth-building and fair participation. That will also help to maintain social peace and to strengthen democratic institutions.The protection of the environment is closely related to development and to the need to safeguard the future of humanity  m few areas are the unity of man and the interdependence of nations clearer than in this one. We must all co-operate to prevent the deterioration of the environment  since we all depend upon it. Environmental protection and preservation are obligations of the international community  of those countries and enterprises with the technology to exploit natural resources  of the States in which those natural resources are found  and of those with the responsibility to use them for their peoples' development.Ecuador has condemned all forms of terrorism because it considers terrorism to be a crime against mankind and believes that it must be fought internationally with the help of all States. The International Conference on Terrorism must be the starting-point in the elimination of this threat  which is often closely linked to the perverse activity of drug trafficking. In recent days there has evolved a vast world-wide movement of solidarity towards the elimination of drug trafficking. Ecuador shares the determination to take whatever action may be necessary to combat the drug menace.Terrorism and drug traffic  underdevelopment  injustice and the denial of freedoms are different ways of violating human rights  whose protection is one of the main concerns of the world Organization. Can anybody doubt that peace is not merely the absence of war but also the rejection of all forms of violence? We are duty-bound to redress injustice and to guarantee freedoms  because the perpetuation of the former and the denial of the latter are a form of aggression against man  sometimes harsher than that inflicted by traditional warfare. Our fight must be ethical and consistent with the values we cherish. There is growing interdependence among States. If being a member of the human species is not enough to make people want to take common action  surely the fact that peace is indivisible and that problems  regardless of where they begin  affect all countries must be sufficient.On the eve of the twenty-first century we have to rethink the role of international operation  which is of crucial importance. We have to examine realistically the circumstances in which we live and the urgent need to act in consonance with the diversity of the present world situation  we must go beyond formal relations and achieve real understandings on which to build a future of Peace and security  equity and prosperity for all. To do otherwise would be tantamount to compromising the dignity of the weakest communities on the world scene. For the last 44 years we have practised here the diplomacy of peace. Here was established in the 1960s the diplomacy for development. We cannot deny that we have experienced frustration. But we have also made historic progress towards eliminating and containing conflicts and reducing injustice among nations. Today we know better  we have more experience and a greater understanding of our realities. Our faith in the principle and purposes of the Organization has not wavered.Let us then resort to the mechanisms available to us and let us  as united nations  give a clear answer to the challenges facing the international community at this time  why not speak about international social justice  about a new diplomacy practised with insight and sincerity  which will define its goals and devise the international measures necessary to achieve them? Let us make interdependence a reality that benefits all of us. This can be done only if  in our interests  we all use our imagination and ingenuity in the  search for peace. Violence  famine  illness  poverty and drug traffic are problems affecting each and every one of us. They are challenges that we must overcome together by attacking their origins  their root causes.On the basis of long personal experience in the Organization I am convinced that all peoples and all Governments have now shown a willingness to be guided by clear thinking  and that the United Nations will make the necessary efforts to take  with a sense of universality and clear realism  the decision to build the new world order that we all hope for. That mission of justice will turn into a crusade of peace.On the fortieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the General Assembly paid posthumous homage to Monsignor Leonidas Proafto  an acknowledged defender of human rights in my country. To conclude this statement  I should like to express Ecuador's deep gratitude for this act by the international community  which has thus extolled a life devoted to the noblest causes of humanity and has given special encouragement to those who believe in man and who work throughout the world to solve the problems of the neediest in our midst. This is the kind of task to which only men and women of goodwill devote themselves."
"46",2137,"EGY",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me pleasure at the beginning of my address to the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly to extend sincere congratulations to you  Sir  upon your election to the presidency of this session  as a faithful son of the glorious continent of Africa and as a representative thereof to this forum. Your election reflects the high esteem in which the international community holds your sisterly country  Nigeria  and your creative qualities and acumen. We are confident that you will discharge the onerous responsibilities of your high office successfully and enrich the traditions established by this great Organization.On this occasion  I wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  for his great efforts during his term of office as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.Since the opening of the forty-third session last year  the world has witnessed important and cardinal developments  both at the international and regional levels. Such developments presage a new era of international relations and make it incumbent upon this gathering to prepare itself for it and follow it up through tine creation of an appropriate environment that would preserve the rights of States  great and small alike  and safeguard their security. Such an environment should ensure a role for everyone in this process  which does not concern the great Powers alone but is related to the future of mankind at large  particularly at a time when the problems facing the third world  especially in the economic domain  are still awaiting agreement on an acceptable framework to cope with them effectively.Therefore we should seek together to broaden our vision of the world in this new era and to define the role each one of us should play in order to contribute to shaping this era and laying down its foundations. Without such collective participation by the family of nations  the era of detente will remain lacking in coherence and be susceptible to vacillation and retrogression  which would adversely affect our vision of the future.My brothers  the African Heads of State or Government  have conferred on me the honour of electing me Chairman of the organization of African Unity at its present session. My country and I highly value this confidence. Egypt was in the vanguard of the liberation movement during an important phase of world history. As ever  Egypt is determined to pursue the struggle until the African continent is totally liberated from racism and oppression  until it rids itself of poverty and want  until it is able to tackle the serious challenges with which it is confronted  and to overcome the numerous problems impeding its drive along the path of development and progress. We firmly believe that  however acute those problems and challenges may be  the African community  with its rich reservoir of historic struggle and a capacity for collective action conducted on the basis of solidarity and team spirit  is amply capable of surmounting those obstacles with strong resolve.If our first preoccupation is to tackle our domestic and regional problems and issues  we are also aware of the interrelatedness and interdependence of those problems and international conditions. Consequently  we are willing to play a primary role in laying down the framework of a new  transformed world in which dispute and controversy give way to common interests and in which natural and human resources are geared to serving the objectives of development and progress  instead of war and destruction.A cursory glance at the challenges facing us at the African level reveals that foremost among them is the issue of confronting the policies and practices of the racist regime in southern Africa. The international community is unanimous in considering those policies as the main cause of the outbreak of acts of violence in that vital region of the continent and of the absence of political and social stability and security therein.we must also constantly bear in mind that what the racist Government in South Africa describes as ""reforms"" are mere superficial measures of form  which do not touch the substance. Moreover  they emanate from a racist outlook that aims at perpetuating the domination of the white minority and misleading the world into believing that steps are being taken in the right direction. If that regime were serious in its move  it would realize that democratic dialogue with the black majority is the only course for reaching a just settlement that would restore the legitimate rights of the oppressed majority  that would safeguard the interests of all parties and put an end to the escalating violence in the South.Since its establishment  the United Nations has assumed a primary role in working for the independence of Namibia. Several resolutions have been adopted regarding the termination of South Africa's mandate over Namibia and the assumption by the United Nations of direct responsibility for its administration. The efforts made by the international Organization were crowned by the adoption of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). This move was concomitant with the bitter struggle waged by the brotherly people of Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  to liberate their soil and regain their freedom. Allow me from this rostrum to pay a tribute to that heroic people which have given the greatest examples of sacrifice  and have demonstrated to the whole world the true mettle of the African peoples.Despite our certainty of the inevitability of victory for the Namibian people and of their success in achieving independence on schedule  the situation calls for much caution and vigilance vis-Ã -vis attempts by the racist minority regime to sabotage this independence and undermine it from the inside  to fake the will of voters and to intimidate them. The Committee of African Heads of State or Government entrusted with following up the situation in southern Africa therefore met in Harare on 21 August 1989 to draw up plans to confront and foil these attempts so that the sun of freedom can rise again on that good land and we can celebrate this great event together next April.The Committee also issued a declaration containing its conception of the African strategy required to confront moves by the racist regime of Pretoria. The strategy affirms equality of rights and obligations among all peoples  irrespective of colour  race  sex or ideology. It issued an appeal inviting peace-loving forces to adopt the call for the release of political detainees and prisoners in South Africa. Such a call deserves the wholehearted attention and support of the Assembly. We cannot tolerate the continuation of this ignominious disgrace in the history of humanity  nor can we be lax in dealing with the destructive effects it engenders. Therefore  it is the duty of the United Nations  which was established to uphold the right of all peoples to freedom and self-determination  to resist the perpetuation of that regime  to work for its further isolation  and to intensify pressure against  it by all possible means so that it can bow to the will of the international community and renounce illusions of being able to continue crushing the vast majority through intimidation  imprisonment  or detainment of intellectuals and freedom fighters.Besides these crushing problems  the African countries suffer especially from the debt problem which has assumed serious dimensions. It also threatens to abort development programmes and is preventing the African countries from modernizing their systems of production and acquiring advanced technology  thereby perpetuating the vicious circle that causes poverty and underdevelopment.In view of the intensity of this problem and the growing awareness of its seriousness  some countries have made praiseworthy initiatives aimed at arresting its effects and containing its complications. However  the ideas put forward are  in our view  inadequate for coping with the problem  its ramifications and its repercussions on the economic and social conditions in various countries of the continent. Therefore  I participated with the leaders of three friendly developing countries - Senegal  Venezuela and India - in proposing an initiative last July designed to reactivate the North-South dialogue and to enrich it by discussing the debt problem in its context. My colleagues  the brotherly African Heads of State or Government  at the recent African summit conference  blessed this initiative. They have mandated me to make the necessary international contacts to push the dialogue forward in the hope that it will lead to the convening of the international conference on debt  in accordance with the resolution adopted at the first extraordinary African summit conference  held in December 1987.There is no doubt that the problem of indebtedness is part of a larger and more comprehensive problem  namely  the existing imbalances in the international economic order. These imbalances have reached proportions that cannot be overlooked or condoned. Consequently  the Ninth Summit Conference of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Belgrade earlier this month  paid particular attention to this problem and placed it at the forefront of the Movement's priorities. The participating Heads of State or Government  who represent more than two thirds of the world leaders  agreed on the need to deal with this problem in a pragmatic  effective manner  given its aggravation and deterioration in recent years. This came as a result of the deterioration of terms of trade  the decline in primary commodity earnings  tariff and non-tariff barriers imposed on developing countries' exports  stagnation of financial flows for investment and development  increase of debt burdens and the net reverse transfer of resources. The problem for many third world countries  especially the African countries  is no longer one of growth and development  but rather one of survival in the literal sense of the word.In this context  we have to decide that world attention to the economic problems of third-world countries should not be limited to providing emergency relief in cases of natural disasters or famine  but should extend to genuine contribution to accelerating the development process.As was the case at the African summit Conference last July  the Non-Aligned summit meeting underlined the importance of engaging in fruitful dialogue with the industrial developed countries about fundamental economic issues. The summit meeting welcomed the quadripartite initiative proposed in the French capital during the summit meeting of the seven industrialized countries. The leaders of the non-aligned countries called for the need to translate the measures and initiatives aimed at debt relief into a comprehensive confrontation of the debt problem  through debt and debt-service reduction  provided such comprehensive tackling embraced all categories of indebted developing countries and all types of debt  both official and commercial.The Non-Aligned Conference paid special attention to the critical economic situation in Africa. It called on the international community to speed up the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development by adopting policies conducive to accelerating growth and development in African countries. The Conference also urged the developed industrialized countries and the financial and development institutions to seek to increase financial flows to Africa and to improve the conditions of transfer and disbursement of these flows. It proposed that Africa's Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes constitute a basis for constructive dialogue between African countries and their development partners in the implementation and financing of country programmes.Related to the international economic problem is the issue of the environment  whether at the word level or on that of Africa. In this regard we have to state two basic facts: first  that African countries are the least responsible for the disruption and deterioration of the environment in comparison with the responsibility of developed countries; secondly  that the deterioration of the environment in Africa is due mainly to poverty  and that an effective resolution of environmental problems resides in environmentally sound development  detrainment by developed countries from dumping nuclear and chemical debris in the territories and on the shores of African countries  and in helping those countries to use clean technology.We have found in some of the developments on the international scene in recent years a glimmer of hope  whether those related to detente in East-West relations or the achievement of tangible progress in the field of disarmament. We are also witnessing the onset of a settlement to a number of regional problems within a limited span of time after long years of escalation and political and military confrontation. The progress made in this context cannot be accidental. Rather  it is a direct reflection of this improvement in the international climate because international political  economic and strategic conditions have become so intertwined and interrelated that each affects  is affected by  and interacts with the others  whatever the distance that separates the sites of events.A scrupulous observer can reach the conclusion that  after our having been faced by challenges  hardships and common dangers that jeopardize our future  these positive developments usher in a new renaissance for all peoples of the world  characterized by dialogue between various communities towards coexistence and fruitful co-operation between East and West  North and South  rich and poor.While the peoples of the third world welcome this positive development which heralds a new era in the history of international relations  they still have many fears and suspicions. This is due mainly to the fact that the detente we witness at present is still largely focused on super-Power relations. Its positive impact has not yet affected the international situation in general. It has not extended in a tangible manner to conditions in the third world  especially economic conditions and related serious social  environmental and political problems.It is true that the super-Powers have concluded significant agreements in the field of disarmament. However  we deem it important for the world to make substantial progress in the field of comprehensive disarmament everywhere. Failing that  no actual development or genuine peace can be achieved. Nor can the results of disarmament be reflected in the enhanced security of third world countries or the prosperity of their peoples.Third world countries also complain that the limited progress made in settling some regional problems has not embraced other  no less important and serious issues  and possibly even more crucial to the security  peace and stability of the whole world.All this leads to the necessity of involving the developing countries in the ongoing dialogue because they are main parties to international problems.Furthermore  they possess many human capabilities and natural resources. They also have social and cultural conditions that should be taken into account when examining major international issues.For example  no one can question the call for respect of human rights. We all share the belief in the right of the individual to a free dignified life and his right to contribute to the formulation of the political and economic options of his country. However  we in the third world see another premise for this issue  namely that human rights are adversely affected by hunger  poverty and fear  by the unjust conditions of international trade  let alone foreign occupation of some of the territories of developing countries and the practice of a racist and exploitive policy against their citizens and their interests. Consequently  we insist on linking human rights as generally defined with the rights of peoples to freedom  progress and self-determination.These notions were behind the objective discussion that took place at the recent summit of the non-aligned countries about those issues which preoccupy peoples everywhere and affect their security and safety. There was consensus within the Movement to seek to reach a common concept to face these urgent issues on the basis of comprehensive dialogue with developed countries. We hope this consensus will meet with the approbation of those countries and that they will look upon third world countries as an equal partner in the management of tomorrow's world  not a third party merely receiving what was decided in absentia  benefiting from the positive aspects  which it had not shared in forging  and suffering from the negative aspects  which it had not caused or helped aggravate.The United Nations has always assumed an important role in laying down the bases of a settlement to the Middle East problem  particularly as regards the Palestinian problem  which enjoys special attention by all African and thirdworld countries. A milestone on the path of a just and peaceful settlement was Security Council resolution 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967  which incorporated a perception of the balance that should be struck between the rights and obligations of both parties. This was complemented by the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly at its consecutive sessions dealing with the rights of the Palestinian people.The Middle East problem has undergone several developments that have brought the Palestinian question to the fore and demonstrated the importance of dealing with it in all its aspects if the objective is to reach a historic comprehensive reconciliation between the Arabs and the Israelis. Such a reconciliation would put an end to war  conflict and devastation. It would also pave the way for a creative coexistence between two parties which are not alienated by historical enmity or by theories based on racist or ethnic considerations. The two parties are bound by the same interest in consolidating peace  stability and development in favour of all the peoples of the region.Therefore  we have insisted that the Palestinian people participate directly in the settlement efforts through the initiation of a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue supported by all peace-loving forces. Such dialogue is aimed at bridging the existing gap in positions  exploring the way to eliminate the conflict once and for all on the basis of applying the principle of land for peace and attaining coexistence and co-operation among all the peoples of the region. The Palestine Liberation organization  as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  has taken positive positions that will help to achieve those goals. This deserves the full support of the international community.I am pleased to state that the efforts we have been making in this respect in the past years have begun to bear fruit. Conditions are now favourable for launching such a dialogue without pre-conditions. It is hoped that the proposed dialogue would lead to a converging perception of steps that would pave the way for peace and for an overall agreement on the conditions and terms for a comprehensive settlement. Therefore  we believe that if this opportunity should be lost it would be a grave mistake certainly surpassing all errors made in the past which led to the loss of historic opportunities to contain the conflict and to end its aggravation.Needless to say  this dialogue will not start from a vacuum. Rather  it will be based on the resolutions and positions which give it international legitimacy  in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people. The dialogue should be followed by steps that require wider international participation within the framework of an international peace conference so that a final comprehensive settlement to that dispute  which has persisted for more than 40 years now  can be reached As far as the Iran-Iraq war is concerned  we express our satisfaction that the cease-fire has become an established fact. However  we cannot conceal our concern with the existing state of no peace  no war  and the probabilities of a new flare-up as a result of the non-completion of arrangements that would lead to the end of belligerence and all its related claims as well as the removal of all its complications. We truly consider that Iraq has declared its willingness to honour its obligations in the context of the sincere implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and in conformity with the August 1988 agreement. It has demonstrated its good faith to participate in the achievement of a just and lasting peace in that region.We hope that Iran - which is bound to the Arabs by deep-rooted historical and spiritual ties - will adopt a decisive position in favour of peace and will seek to establish normal good-neighbourly relations with its Arab neighbours  especially with Iraq  so that Arab-Iranian relations can return to the situation maintained throughout history - a situation that is necessitated by geographical neighbourliness and a similarity of perils and interests.We have also followed the bloody tragedy in sisterly Lebanon for years now with great regret and sorrow. We believe that the suffering of the Lebanese people must be ended. The threats to which they are subjected  which endanger their national and territorial unity  should be halted. This will be achieved only through the cessation of all forms of occupation and foreign intervention in its affairs  the removal of all restraints imposed on its independent national decisions  respect for its sovereignty and right to free choice and the elimination of aspects of partition which have intruded on Lebanon in these years of agony. We therefore support the sincere efforts made by the Arab tripartite committee towards achieving those objectives. We hope that those efforts will succeed  thus leading to the adoption of the decisive steps we anticipate within the few coming weeks.Any setback in these efforts would have the most serious consequences to all parties  even if they are unable to grasp this indisputable fact.I need not emphasize our full support for the United Nations and our adherence to its purposes  principles and Charter. They are entrenched in the hearts of our peoples and have been a source of inspiration for our peoples in formulating the framework that governs their domestic and international actions  particularly with respect to the Organization of African Unity  which was established to liberate Africa from domination and exploitation  and to apply the principle of equality among individuals and States  irrespective of their share of power or might  to achieve co-operation among the African States  which face the same dangers and challenges  to spread a human and noble message based on adherence to morality and sublime ideals in transactions  respect for the. rights of others  rejection of the theories of supremacy or discrimination between human beings and on building bridges between all nations and peoples.The third world countries stand firm with all other countries in the world in expressing their confidence in the United Nations and their appreciation of its role  looking to the future of collective life on our planet with great hopes and aspirations. They have resolved to assert their will for the option of peace  to mobilize their resources to serve the objectives of development and progress  to orient their potential towards safeguarding security and stability and to open up vistas of hope for generations to come.Through objective and constructive action  armed with clear vision that does not miss the target  with faith in the unity of human destiny and through adherence to legitimacy and the rule of law  we shall forge ahead towards a better tomorrow  nurturing the growth of freedom and hoisting the banners of peace  building glory and spreading civilization. With enlightened thinking and determined action  weshall overcome hardships  surmount obstacles and barriers  place right before might and civilized discourse above the harsh growl of cannon."
"47",2207,"ESP",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like to express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Joseph Garba on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at this session. His qualifications and outstanding activity in this Organization are of fundamental value for the success of our work. I also wish to express my thanks for the excellent work done by his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  and to reiterate our full support and deep gratitude to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for his untiring work at the head of the Secretariat.Since the founding of the United Nations  we have probably never witnessed as we do today so many efforts to improve the international climate or so many changes in the framework that has governed international relations for the past 40 years. Ideological intransigence  confrontation as a means of diplomacy and indifference to the overwhelming economic  social and political problems of a significant part of mankind have started to give way in the face of mankind's growing aspirations to broaden the scope of coexistence  to lay the foundations of true peace and to consolidate the notion that the individual is the direct and primary beneficiary of all government action. Although  unfortunately  many bloody conflicts persist in various parts of the globe  in recent times the use of force as an instrument in international relations has been shown to be futile. International co-operation  in which multilateralism must  in our opinion  be a key factor  has now to a large extent reduced the level of confrontation and the number of situations that could lead to war. Owing to the globalisation of current problems  we must also judiciously consider other dimensions which are equally essential to peace  and in which this increasingly vital international co-operation has not progressed as much as we would have liked. I refer  for example  to issues such as the differences between rich and poor countries  economic development  man's relationship with nature and the progressive deterioration of the environment  and phenomena such as terrorism and drug trafficking - to which I shall refer later in my statement.First  with regard to the changes in Europe  the new climate in East-West relations - which has been observed in this Assembly - is encouraging. This is true not only with regard to the reduction of tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the military alliances and their members  but also in relation to domestic changes in many countries  with progress in democratisation and respect for human rights. In this context  I wish to highlight the processes under way in Poland and Hungary and in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately  not all Eastern European countries are following these desirable paths.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)   with all its dimensions  has played a fundamental role in this whole process of European detente between countries and within countries. Moreover  it has been imbued with fresh vigour with the adoption of the Final Document of the Vienna meeting.We welcome the significant role played by the United Nations in the present international context. Recognition by its Member States of the undeniable value of multilateralism has considerably broadened the Organization's scope for manoeuvre and has enabled its efforts to be more fruitful. The growing political realism of many countries which in the past were reluctant to accept solutions that were not extreme; the progress towards more pragmatism in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries; the resolute action of the Security Council reinforced by the new co-operation among its permanent members; and the intelligent work of the Secretary-General are basic elements of that stimulating process.Nevertheless  we are still a long way from an international society in which violence  poverty and the violation of fundamental human rights are absent. The United Nations can do and has done much to bring us closer to that objective  but its action cannot be successful if  at the same time  those engaged in these conflicts do not have the clear political will to terminate them.Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  adopted over two years ago  laid the foundations for negotiating a solution to the bloody war between Iran and Iraq. It is true that since then the guns have been silenced  but peace in the region is fragile and little progress has been made towards a just and lasting solution reached through the full implementation of resolution 598 (1987). Therefore the process of negotiation now under way under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative must be intensified  and I assure them once again of the full backing of my Government for their delicate mission.In Afghanistan  the signing in April last year of the Geneva Agreements opened the way to a solution. This year the final withdrawal of Soviet troops has been completed  making a peaceful settlement of the problem possible. Efforts must nevertheless be intensified to achieve a lasting settlement based on the Afghan people's exercise of the right to self-determination without outside interference. In order to achieve that goal  a broadly based Government representing all the parties to the conflict must be formed and any refugees wishing to do so must be allowed to return. The continued efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve that peaceful settlement should be supported  and the General Assembly should renew his mandate.The evolution of the situation in southern Africa over the past year has shown hopeful signs on some fronts. Unfortunately  the intolerable system of apartheid persists in South Africa. We trust that the recent political changes in South Africa will lead to a more realistic and intelligent attitude when the time comes to undertake the necessary process leading to a truly democratic  pluralistic and non-racist society in that country. Once more we demand the lifting of the state of emergency  the legalization of all political parties and groups that oppose apartheid  and the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners.The historic process that started in Namibia last April has our unconditional support. We are confident that the process of independence will be completed within the agreed schedule and we reiterate our full confidence in and support for the Secretary-General and his Special Representative regarding their mission in Namibia. Spain is participating by means of a large contingent in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. I should like to place on record here our determination to provide financial backing for the new country.We welcomed with great satisfaction the Gbadolite agreements complementing those which  towards the end of last year  made it possible to start the gradual withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. We trust that there will be a total cessation of hostilities  which will lead that country to national reconciliation. free of foreign forces. At the same time  we support the contacts established in Mozambique with a view to ending the violence. We call for the immediate cessation of all outside attempts to destabilize that country. We also express our hope that the processes begun in Namibia and Angola will have a positive influence in Mozambique and the southern region as a whole  particularly in the front-line States.The withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia constitutes a positive but insufficient step. We regret the suspension of the Paris Conference  where greater flexibility from the parties involved in the conflict could have been expected. Efforts must continue in pursuit of a settlement allowing for the establishment of a broadly based Government of national reconciliation that will enable the country to face its future reconstruction with optimism  with no possibility of a return to a recent past which inflicted so much suffering on the Cambodian people.We have followed with interest the proposals by the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage in bilateral talks. President Roh's initiative submitted at this forum on 18 October of last year was particularly praiseworthy. However  tension on the peninsula still prevails. This can be overcome only through intensified dialogue and greater flexibility.The tragic events that took place in China deeply moved large sectors of international public opinion. We are following the evolution of the situation with the greatest interest and we hope that the process of reform and openness in all its aspects  including the political  will gain strength shortly  in order to satisfy the Chinese people's legitimate aspirations to liberty and democracy.The Maghreb is a region of special interest to Spain. My Government has already expressed its satisfaction at the historic agreement reached at the summit in Marrakesh  at which the Maghreb Arab Onion was set up.We must increase the co-operation and efforts aimed at solving the Western Saharan problem. Spain is following developments in this respect with justifiable concern. The positive steps taken last year - and particularly the acceptance in principle by the parties involved of the Secretary-General's proposals for the holding of a referendum on self-determination in satisfactory conditions  under United Nations supervision - gave a great impetus to the process  which nevertheless has not yet finally crystallized. Spain  which is providing all the necessary technical co-operation  continues to support unreservedly the efforts aimed at unblocking the process. The pursuit of direct contacts between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front could contribute significantly to that.The Cyprus problem has yet to be solved despite the renewed efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative. The interruption of the inter-communal dialogue is a cause for concern. We state once again that the solution must be based on respect for the unity  independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus  pursuant to the relevant United Nations resolutions.In the Middle East  prospects for achieving a just solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict remain uncertain. The situation in the occupied territories continues to deteriorate dramatically. We deplore the measures of collective punishment carried out by Israel  which have merely increased the already great; suffering of the population. We appeal to the Israeli authorities to abide by the Security Council resolutions on the subject and to respect the provisions of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention  which is fully applicable to the occupied territories.We believe that the permanent members of the Security Council have an important part to play in achieving a rapprochement between the parties to the conflict and facilitating the convening of the International Peace Conference. The Palestine Liberation Organization must participate in that Conference  which we still believe to be the appropriate framework for bringing about the opening of direct negotiations between the parties involved.The guidelines of the policy of the Twelve are reflected in the Madrid Declaration referred to by the current Chairman of the Council of Ministers  Mr. Dumas. We trust that the appeal that we made in Madrid to the parties involved lead to peace and will not be disregarded. President Mubarak's efforts to bring about talks between Israel and a Palestinian delegation deserve our support  with a view to an overall  just and 1 as ting solution based on the principle of peace for territories.In that context  our call for moderation and good sense in Lebanon is even more peremptory. There has been a tragic deterioration in the crisis. Violence has claimed thousands of innocent lives  including that of the Ambassador of Spain in Beirut  Mr. Pedro de Aristegui. We confirm our backing for the work of the Tripartite Committee. Once more we call upon all the parties to the conflict to co-operate unreservedly by immediately establishing and respecting a total cease-fire  which will enable the necessary internal reforms to be implemented and make peace possible in a sovereign  independent Lebanon  free of foreign forces.Central America has continued to be the focus of the international community's special attention. The Security Council has given explicit backing to the Central American agreements. Over the course of recent months we have had clear evidence of the political will of those directly involved to overcome their differences and find solutions through dialogue. The El Salvador agreements reached last February and the recent Tela summit conference of Presidents outlined a very positive set of initiatives.That progress also owes a great deal to the tenacious action of the Secretary-General aid his collaborators. At the express wish of the Central American Presidents  the United Nations is playing an important role in this process. The time-limits foreseen in the Tela agreements have been changed to speed up the process. We trust that the Security Council will adopt the necessary resolutions to ensure that this process will be set in motion as quickly as possible.Spain is especially hopeful about this process  which it has encouraged from the beginning. It has given - and remains willing to give - all the necessary help within its power. Our will is clear. There is no alternative to this framework for peace. We will support with concrete actions  not just with words  all efforts in this direction. In this connection  I wish to remind you of the support provided by the European Community to the programme for Central American regional economic integration. In this respect  we welcome the discussions which have already begun between the Government of El Salvador and the EMLN  and we trust that these may lead to complete national reconciliation.In this context I would like to discuss peace-keeping operations. The United Nations is playing an ever greater role in the search for solutions to regional conflicts. We are pleased that it is receiving the necessary backing from the Security Council. Spain has decided to participate in various operations. It has supplied military observers for the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and a significant part of the air component of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. Spain is also willing to co-operate in the operations which will presumably be launched in Central America.The United Nations has contributed decisively to the process of decolonisation  which  with the forthcoming independence of Namibia  is approaching its conclusion. However  some cases are still pending. One of them is that of Western Sahara  to which I have already referred. East Timor is another. The start of talks between Portugal and Indonesia is a positive element towards a solution in conformity with the principles of the United Nations.With respect to the Malvinas Islands  we have always supported direct negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom as a means of solving all outstanding problems between the two countries  including that of sovereignty. There have recently been new expectations of dialogue and we hope that the talks to be started by the two countries next month will lead to progress in this direction. We are pleased that both countries  with which we have friendly relations  have chosen Madrid as the place for the holding of these talks.A particularly anachronistic colonial situation persists on the European continent  which affects the territorial integrity of my own country. No one is unaware of Spanish sensitivities in connection with the question of Gibraltar. We have chosen the path of negotiation as recommended by the General Assembly  with a view to concluding the process of decolonisation through the restoration of our territorial integrity  while at the same time preserving the interests of the Population of Gibraltar as well as those of the population of the ""Campo de Gibraltar"". As regards disarmament  confidence and transparency are. and we hope  will continue to be crucial elements in the process of East-West detente. We must continue to seek the reaction of the existing balances in the various categories of weapons as confidence- and security-building measures. In this process of enhancing security through disarmament and the reduction of levels of armaments  verification must play a fundamental role in order to ensure that agreements are copied with and also to avoid arousing suspicions.Spain welcomes the progress made in Europe in the field of arms control and disarmament since the last General Assembly At our last summit meeting the countries members of the Atlantic alliance stated our intention to conclude the  negotiations on conventional weapons by the mid-1990s  thus contributing to increasing the security not only of the European continent but also of the international community as a whole.As regards nuclear weapons and the strategic arms reduction talks (START) we trust that by 1990 the negotiations  including the current ones  will be concluded. To that end  the results of the conversations held last week in Wyoming are encouraging.The question of arms control and disarmament must not be limited  however  to the East-West dimension. The recent Paris Conference stressed the urgent need for the rapid conclusion of the treaty for the complete and global elimination of chemical weapons. The proposals made by President Bush at the current session and Mr. Shevardnadze's positive response to them are encouraging in this respect.On the question of human rights we have seen undeniable progress made in some countries  although in many others there has been stagnation  if not regression. We must prevent the economic difficulties encountered in some democracies which tend to perpetuate certain violations of human rights. The task of international codification in relevant aspects of the protection of human rights has recently been considerable  and this gives us great satisfaction.In particular  I should like to express Spain's support for the draft Convention on the Rights of the Child  which we hope will be adopted at the current session  and the draft Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. Nevertheless  we continue to think that rather than concentrating on creating new international instruments  we must emphasize the proper application of those already in existence. We must strengthen the United Nations mechanisms for the identification and eradication of violations of human rights. In particular  we consider highly desirable both the strengthening of the Commission on Human Rights and increased co-operation with it on the part of Member States.I wish to refer to some items which continue to be on the United Nations agenda and which  unfortunately  will continue to be for some time. First  with reference to human rights - in regard to which there has been undeniable progress in many countries  although in others the matter has been at a standstill and in still others it has been retrograde - we must not allow the economic difficulties suffered by some democracies to perpetuate certain violations of human rights.I wish to highlight our particular satisfaction with the strengthening of democracy and freedom taking place in Latin America. We are convinced that the forthcoming elections in Chile will lead to the full restoration of freedom in that country. However  the urgent economic problems  which in some countries coincide with the advancement of freedom  democracy and human rights  have given rise to a new phenomenon: economically poor democracies.The latest report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) points out that there are three problems that have been fuelling one another and leading to a vicious circle: external debt  domestic financial instability  and social and economic stagnation. A number of Latin American countries have failed in their attempts to stabilize and revive their economies.The burden of debt is strangling many countries. There can be little optimism about the expectations for growth and about inflation in the Latin American countries next year  Patience  tenacity and imagination will be required. We need to build a new global framework for the purpose of redesigning the debt strategy  while at the same time approaching each case individually. The objective is not merely to attain economic growth in those countries  but rather to sustain its development.Here we must work on two fronts. True  the debtor countries must continue to strive to increase the competitiveness and flexibility of their economies  without dissembling the cost to society. The international community must facilitate the obtaining of adequate external financing through a combination of three elements: repatriation of capital  the reduction of debt and of its servicing and new loans.I should like to point out the important role of the Brady Plan concerning debt reduction. Here  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank must work together; designing and supervising the adjustment and growth programmes and also contributing to reinforcing debt reduction transactions through the channelling of new funds.Spain has proposed that a European guarantee fund be set up in the European Community. This initiative was discussed in the Council at Madrid. The European Community has become even more aware of the magnitude and seriousness of the debt problem  as was seen at the meeting we had in Grenada with the Permanent Mechanism for Consultation and Political Co-operation  the Group of Eight.The main goal is balanced economic development for the less favoured countries. Price oscillations and problems affecting some commodities do not help to achieve this goal. These commodities are of great importance in the export earnings of a large proportion of developing countries. We must regulate the commodities market  hearing in mind the component of co-operation and development aid. We are pleased about the coming into force of the Common Commodities Fund  putting an end to the deadlock which has lasted for 10 years.We are also pleased  within the context of international trade  by the unblocking of the Uruguay Round.Finally  we should recall here that the high level of indebtedness and the fall of export earnings in commodity markets have in the case of sub-Saharan African countries been combined with the advance of desertification  cyclical droughts and natural disasters to create a tragic situation. We must support  and are doing so  the various financial initiatives that have been advanced by various international organs  at the same time reinforcing the policy of co-operation with the African continent by giving significant economic stimulus for co-operation with those countries.I should now like to make a very specific reference to North-South relations within the context of the United Nations.Next April the General Assembly will hold a special session on international economic co-operation and the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries. We believe that this will be an ideal occasion to achieve  among ourselves  a realistic economic consensus on a world scale. Work in this direction must proceed along with the preparations for a new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade  the launching of a new substantive programme of action for the less developed countries  at the Paris Conference in September 1990  and  lastly  the International Conference on the Environment and Development  in 1992.In referring to the environment  I should like to point out that international co-operation of a new kind is necessary in trying to solve another problem that affects nothing less than living conditions on our planet. The recent Hague Declaration  adopted at a conference at which countries all over the world were represented  states that as the problem is planetary  its solution can only be conceived at a world level and that it has three characteristics: it is vital  urgent and global.The holding in 1992 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development should be focused on an analysis of these problems  apart from co-operation between the North and the South  and hence on consideration of the environmental factor in programmes of development aid.The Conference will of course deal with questions of world dimensions  such as the greenhouse effect  protection of the o2one layer  the trans-border movements of wastes  and other things. These affect all countries but have major implications for the developing countries  both economically and financially  as well as with respect to technological support and transfers. It is an enormously delicate subject  and any solution therefore must be based on mutual respect and co-operation in a joint effort.Spain agrees with the Bruntland report recommendation that environmental problems be tackled while taking the different regional situations into account.I would recall that the European Community has already taken some important steps in some respects for preservation of the global environment. Among these general problems I have referred to  which form part of the new agenda of the United Nations  as I put it  I would like to add a few words about terrorism and drug trafficking. In spite of the efforts of the international community terrorism still gravely endangers the lives of countries and coexistence among nations. This threat manifests itself individually in each country  but it is a collective threat. Terrorist attacks are an act of aggression against the whole international community. We therefore have to strengthen international co-operation. Sensitive to this need  the General Assembly succeeded in achieving an important consensus against terrorism in resolution 40/61. Today  it is our task to consolidate and develop it.We cannot talk of terrorism without talking about drug trafficking  they are so often connected. In his annual report the Secretary-General reminds us that ""the monetary value of drug trafficking has recently surpassed that of international trade in oil and is second only to the arms trade"". (A/44/1  p. 23)We are  then  faced with a problem of tremendous ramifications. The way to fight this threat is through concrete international co-operation  accompanied by reinforcement of each country's domestic measures.The International Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs is a far-reaching instrument. All Member States should adhere to it without delay.We should also make progress in harmonizing and bringing national legislations closer to each other. There are matters that must be resolved urgently. We must activate this process. The 1983 Convention can serve as a framework of reference.As a result of that Convention  the importance of the so-called precursors for drug synthesis has been made clear. Precursor-producing countries must make an effort to control their exports and thus co-operate in repression of the illegal drug trade.Drug consuming countries also are responsible for the drug-trafficking phenomenon and must carry out programmes and action directed at decreasing domestic demand and thus reducing the traffic in drugs. For some years Spain has been developing educational and preventive measures to this end.We should not forget  either  on this major theme of narcotic trafficking  actions designed to investigate large capitals  properties and the bank accounts of alleged drug traffickers  actions that have made possible a qualitative change in the fight against this scourge. The world banking system shares responsibility for the solution of this problem. We therefore ask for its co-operation. Similarly  it is necessary for the so-called tax havens to understand that hiding information related to business derived from drug trafficking is tantamount to collaborating in one of the most serious acts of aggression against mankind.We have to continue pursuing action in support of and in co-operation with Governments and peoples of coca-producing countries  helping their economic development and generously promoting alternatives to cultivation of this substance.The action taken by the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control has proved effective for this purpose.I should like to stress that there has been exemplary action  which we support  by Colombia  which should receive an adequate response from international bodies in this cause. In Colombia what is at stake is the capacity of the State based on the rule of law to stand up to a group of criminals who are attempting to destroy its basic structures.In contusion  I should like to make a brief observation. As I have said throughout this statement  international co-operation must now go beyond the mere fundamental pursuit of peace. We must improve the quality of international life  so that we also improve the quality of national life  aid above all the personal life of each individual. We must strive to achieve a new world in which all men and woman count. This Assembly and the United Nations as a whole  will face not fewer but more problems. I trust they will contribute significantly to their solution.There are some old questions among these new problems  often urgent. We have spoken of poverty and marginalization  and of the threats of drug trafficking and terrorism  which threaten our whole planet and the environment. The time left to us before these problems become catastrophic is not without limits} it is  indeed  rather short. The solution lies in our own hands if we are willing to co-operate. Thus  Spain believes we are witnessing a new era in the history of the United Nations."
"48",2279,"ETH",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to extend to you  on behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and on my own behalf  wane congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.Your election was indeed a great tribute both to the significant role our sister country of Nigeria plays in world affairs and to you personally  as a widely experienced diplomat. As I state my delegation's conviction that you will steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion  I wish at the same time to assure you of our fullest co-operation as you discharge your heavy responsibilities.I wish also to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to your predecessor. Nr. Dante Caputo  for the effective manner in which he presided over the forty-third session of the General Assembly. Let me also put on record our sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Peres de Cuellar  for the firm commitment he has always shown to multilateralism and for his unflinching dedication to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.Since the last session of the General Assembly we have been expressing optimism about new trends in international relations and increased hope about the future of our planet. The relaxation of tension in world politics over the course of the past two years has to a large extent justified that outlook. Today more than ever before we have sufficient reason to be more confident about the possibility of erecting a structure of peace in our world. The improvement in relations between the two major Powers has contributed significantly to the reduction of tension and to a better climate in international relations. Confrontation has started gradually to give way to dialogue and co-operation.Obviously  the past cannot be undone. But lessons learned from past mistakes should prepare the international community to seize the new opportunities that are opening up. It is to be recalled that the confrontation between the power blocs that was the hallmark of the period after the Second World War gave rise to a Mind-set which was oblivious to the common danger faced by the human race. The Mutual hostility engendered and fuelled by the cold war left no room for accommodation.Reason has  however  always pointed to the fact that those differences  regardless of their significance  were never important enough for us to allow them to overshadow mankind's common interest in ensuring survival. Nevertheless  the establi3hment of durable peace became elusive. The wasting of human resources In the quest for military supremacy  a pursuit that has always been  chimera  drained off resources that could otherwise have been used to promote development and alleviate the sufferings of humanity.The adverse implications of the cold war were especially notable for newly independent and developing countries. In a climate of intolerance for different ideas  efforts by independent nations to seek their own solutions to their problems were viewed with hostility.In the meantime  it was becoming abundantly clear that  apart from the nuclear danger that has been a part of our life since the Second World war  the number of challenges directly impinging on our survival  the proper engagement of which required international co-operation  were reminding us of our interdependence and our common destiny. We are indeed gratified that in the past years the first steps have been taken  albeit in very limited areas of International life  to address issues of vital importance on the basis of accommodation and compromise.In the past few years we have had the opportunity to see how  given the necessary political will  an international political environment conducive to the removal of obstacles to the search for solutions to some of the most intractable political problems could be created. The commencement of the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia is a testimony to the capacity of the United Nations to discharge such important responsibilities when there exists the appropriate international environment. At the same time  we recognize that the Organization is facing a major challenge in ensuring free and fair elections in Namibia under its supervision and control on the bas is of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).That South Africa is only going through a pretence of allowing free and fair elections in Namibia has been obvious all along. Its determination to steal the elections scheduled to take place next month has been made plain by events in Namibia in the course of the past few months. Not only is South Africa committed to seeing the elections conducted on the basis of rules that would allow it to get the elections to go its way  but it is also making every effort through intimidation and murder to prevent the South West Africa People's Organization from participating fully in a free and fair election.Under the circumstances  the United Nations - and particularly the Security Council - must continue to be vigilant and take all necessary effective action with a view to ensuring that the November elections in Namibia are conducted in full compliance with the spirit and letter of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Successful implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia will no doubt constitute a significant step towards lasting peace and stability in the region  thus contributing to an improvement in international relations. Although a conclusive settlement of the Iran-Iraq conflict is still awaited the fact that the cease-fire continues to hold is a significant achievement.Tranquillity is yet to be restored in Afghanistan  but the Geneva Agreements have demonstrated the values of peace and the consequent reduction in international tension.Ms are also hopeful that the efforts aimed at resolving the problem in Cambodia will pick up momentum once again. No doubt  the withdrawal by Viet Nam of its troops contributes towards expediting the achievement of a durable peace in Cambodia.In Central America  the steps taken by the States in the region have paved the way for greater understanding. We extend to them our support in their continued efforts to implement their joint decisions. It is our earnest hope that Nicaragua will finally be given the opportunity to concentrate fully functional construction.As we duly note the positive changes taking place in our world  we need at the same time to be realistic enough to acknowledge that such remains to be done in order to ensure peace and the survival of humanity  as well as to lay the foundation for a structure of international relations based en justice  equality and democracy.Despite notable achievements made in the area of nuclear disarmament in the last few years the momentum towards the complete elimination of these dangerous weapons of destruction has not been commensurate with the expectation of the international community. The threat posed by the stockpiles of nuclear weapons remains as grave as ever. Older the circumstances  a speedy conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  measures to prevent the extension of the arms race into outer space  and an agreement on the prohibition of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons continue to be priority issues. No less because  we feel it should be attached to the need to finalize and conclude as soon as possible  the ongoing negotiation on a chemical weapons convention.. The commitment expressed both by the Soviet Union and the United States at this session of the General Assembly to destroy the bulk of their chemical weapons will  no doubt  give impetus to the efforts under way at the Conference on Disarmament towards achieving an agreement on the long overdue convention.It is also obvious that there are still a number of vital issues relating to international peace and security that have not yet been properly addressed or regarding which little progress has been made.Indeed it remains a source of major disappointment to us that  despite the changed international climate and the reform promises of the racist regime  no significant move has been made towards the dismantlement of the evil system of apartheid. Conditions in South Africa continue essentially unaltered and no progress can be anticipated unless the international community takes effective measures to increase the pressure on Pretoria  including the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.In this connection  my delegation wishes to emphasize the significance of the declaration adopted by the Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the Organization of African Unity on the question of South Africa at its 3rd meeting in Harare  Zimbabwe  on 21 August 1989. The implementation of the principles and ideas contained in that declaration could facilitate the peaceful resolution of the problems created by apartheid and the establishment in South Africa of a government based on equality  justice and democracy. At no time should it be forgotten  however  that this aim can succeed only if international pressure on the racist regime is vigorously continued.In the Middle East  durable peace will always be beyond reach so long as the Palestinian people are denied their rights as a people. In this connectionÂ· I wish once again to reiterate the repeated call made by the General Assembly for the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all parties to the conflict.The prevailing increased level of international understanding is yet to have an impact also on the state of affairs in the Korean peninsula. The quest for peaceful reunification by the Korean people should be addressed without further delay. My delegation fully supports the desire and efforts of the people of Korea foe the restoration of their national unity and looks forward to the day when it will assume its rightful place in this community of nations.The search for global freedom and justice will remain incomplete so long as peoples continue to be subjected to the evils of colonialism and racism anywhere. In this regard  the year 1990 - during which we shall be commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  as well as ensuring the success of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism - should afford us added opportunity to intensify our concerted efforts towards the total elimination of all manifestations of colonialism by the year 2000.These are but some of the major indications that the task of making the current improvement in world affairs more complete and comprehensive is a challenge  the international community has yet to address.A new world order  radically different from the one we ought to leave behind us requires  as its foundation  a full democratization of international relations. This should be a world in which principles relating to the sovereign equality of States  non-interference in internal affairs and the sanctity of the independence and territorial integrity of countries are fully respected. The new world order we wish to see would of course not be devoid of major Powers. But it should be an order in which the greatness of nations is measured not by their relative military might or economic power but by the respect they command through their contribution to international co-operation and harmony  as well as to the development of human civilization.We should go beyond the conception that international peace and security are jeopardized only by issues that are political and military in nature.The framers of the Charter of the United Nations had the foresight to declare  in Article 1  the achievement of  international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character  as one of the purposes of the United Nations.We have seen throughout the 1980s the gradual deterioration in the economic situation of the developing world. The overall condition in these countries  especially in the least developed among them  is becoming a source of great concern.In order to reverse the deteriorating economic situation and ensure sustained development  developing countries have resorted to what we may refer as the orthodox structural adjustment programmes. But these have not helped arrest economic decline  largely because the economic problems of developing countries are deep-rooted and require more than playing around with monetary policies for their effective resolution.This has been obvious from the experience of existing structural adjustment programmes. These programmes  relying on a combination of devaluation  trade liberalization and deflation  have often failed to give sufficient attention to the human dimension of development. After the Khartoum Conference there is now universal agreement that countries on the brink of economic disintegration cannot possibly undertake a further cut in their social welfare budgets. In addition the historically inherited and persistent structural constraints on developing countries  particularly the least developed countries  are only now being fully appreciated. Such constraints are numerous and span a wide spectrum ranging from a lack of physical infrastructure and market integration to steady environmental degradation  high and accelerating rates of population growth  pitifully low levels of technology  and exceptionally narrow domestic markets. These are exacerbated by the unfavourable external economic environment.In the African region  the recognition of these problems and the continued exacerbation of economic conditions  even with the orthodox structural adjustment programmes  have led us to search for an alternative conceptual framework for the alleviation of our economic difficulties. This search has involved a long process of consultation  discussion and revision  which has finally resulted in the unanimous adoption of the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes (AAFSAP) by the joint meetings of Ministers of Planning and Finance of the countries members of the Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa last April.AAFSAP  taking its cue from the Lagos Plan of Action and the African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery  and the lessons to be learned from a review of current structural adjustment programmes  aims at evolving an alternative  human-centred framework for adjustment with transformation. It should be noted that the African alternative framework is above all a framework and not a blueprint for economic transformation  and will no doubt be enriched by greater dialogue  application and monitoring.Of course  even before the finalisation of AAFSAP many countries in Africa had already begun to think of appropriate development strategies for the 1990s. In ray Own country  despite the heavy burden on our meagre resources caused by a massive influx of refugees  now totalling nearly 1 million  we have initiated a number of  measures designed to ensure food self-sufficiency. These range from a detailed national food and nutrition strategy to the more recent disaster prevention and preparedness strategy intended to provide  inter alia  an effective early warning and food buffer-stocking capability. We have also been moving ahead with a national population policy to place development on a sounder footing. Various new economic programmes are also being implemented. The objective of the new economic policy initiatives and directions is to encourage the private sector to invest in agriculture  industry and services and the public sector to improve its management and thereby raise the level of its efficiency.Currently  we are also engaged in the formulation of a national conservation strategy aimed at stemming the rapid erosion of forest cover and the consequent decline in soil fertility. In addition  during the last two years there have been institutional designs in planning and administrative structures geared towards greater decentralization of decision-making. By these means we hope to ensure that the great ecological and cultural diversity of the country is taken fully into account in the appropriate regional plans.No doubt this search for new development strategies is under way in most countries in Africa. The adoption of adjustment with transformation as outlined in AAFSAP constitutes a further step towards the working-out of nationally led programmes of economic transformation in the coming decade.It is clear that for their part developing countries need to do whatever is necessary and to exert maximum effort in order to remove the impediments to their economic development. In the final analysis  each country is indeed responsible for its own development. However  what we should not fail to appreciate is that a favourable external environment is needed to unleash the potential of the developing countries. Moreover  even in the best of circumstances  development will always be a difficult goal to achieve unless States are given the opportunity to establish peace within their territories as well as within their respective regions.In this regard  I am happy to note here that the situation in our region has improved markedly over the last year or so. As the normalization of relations between my country and Sorealla pursuant to an agreement concluded between the two countries last year testifies  we have been exerting the maximum effort to create the necessary conditions for the prevalence of peace and stability in our region. We have also continued our effort with a view to establishing a firm basis for constructive and friendly relations based on mutual trust and confidence between my country and the Sudan.Indeed  our commitment to peace has always been unreserved. There is no better testimony to this fundamental and decisive steps that the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia continues to take in our own country. It would be remiss of me  in this connection  if I failed to express appreciation to the international community for the encouragement and support it has given to our efforts to restore peace in our region and remove the obstacles to our economic development.It has become evident that issues requiring international co-operation have started to proliferate. The problems of the environment  if not properly managed  could seriously affect the survival and viability of our planet. The scourge of drug-trafficking has assumed dangerous proportions  thus calling for urgent and concerted international action. Hence  attaining the goal of strengthening the role and voice of the United Nations in international affairs is a matter to which the highest priority ought to be given. As a country very closely associated with the Organization since its very inception  we draw satisfaction from seeing the United Nations becoming more effective in the discharge of its responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security. It is our earnest hope that the Organization will play an equally effective role in the quest for solutions to the problems that affect international economic relations.In this connection  my delegation looks forward to the convening of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and in particular to the revitalisation of economic growth and development in the developing countries Â· which is scheduled to take place in April next year. We are confident that the special session will provide the necessary Impetus for removing the obstacles that have stalemated the North-South dialogue.It goes without saying that as the tasks assigned to the United Nations expand so will its requirements for resources  if it is to be able to discharge its responsibilities effectively. Thus  the financial standing of the Organization should continue to be given the maximum attention it deserves.In concluding  I wish to reaffirm Ethiopia's continued commitment t to the United Nations and our determination to contribute our share to all endeavours designed to give the Organization a decisive voice in world affairs. "
"49",2325,"FIN",44,1989,"ï»¿May I begin by congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your wide experience in the United Nations makes you especially qualified to guide the Assembly and its deliberations. You have my best wishes for the demanding task that lies ahead of you. May I also express my thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Dante Caputo  who so ably fulfilled his role on behalf of the Assembly. It gives me particular pleasure to pay tribute to the Secretary-General. We owe a great deal to his authority and leadership.As we are assembled here for the annual general debate  every Member state needs to reflect on certain fundamental questions. Is the United Nations doing everything possible in order to meet its challenges? Are we making progress? Can we say that the United Nations enters the last decade of this century with determination and justified self-confidence? Is my own country doing everything it can in order to help the world Organization? The answers to these questions must be sought in the actual work of the Organization and of its Member States. For my part  I shall try to emphasize some of the challenges we in Finland regard as particularly imports at the present time. It seems to us that the main challenges can be expressed in two words -insecurity and poverty. Both produce fear  d suffering. Neither can be dealt with by any single remedy.The United Nations was created first and foremost in order to maintain international peace and security. In this respect  the past year represents a mixture of success and disappointment. We are encouraged by the high-level dialogues that have continued between the major Powers. we have witnessed with satisfaction such concrete achievements as the continuing progress in the verified dismantling and destruction of American and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear weapons. As one of the participating States in the process of the Conference on Security and cooperation in Europe  Finland follow  closely and with  much hope the new efforts to achieve substantive conventional disarmament in Europe.At the same time we are concerned about the violence that has erupted and continues in many parts of the world. Most of the underlying problem are already on the agenda of the General Assembly  and we shall express our views on them in due course. Now I want to speak about the global challenges. As regards the process of disarmament on the global level our hopes in Finland are fastened particularly on the preparation of a chemical weapons convention. The political will is there  as was demonstrated again at the conferences held in Paris and in Canberra this year. During this year  as before  Finnish experts have continued their research in order to help to develop appropriate methods that could meet the complex verification requirements  global and comprehensive chemical weapons convention. We expect progress from the protracted negotiations with growing impatience. We welcome the impetus recently given them in the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.Security on the global level must take into account other factors in addition to armaments and military threats. Security requires confidence in the future. Such confidence must be felt both by Governments and by their peoples. Only a representative Government that respects human rights and that therefore enjoys the confidence of its own people can face the future with a sense of security and successfully maintain stable relations with other Governments. Some dramatic - in fact  tragic - events have recently illustrated the importance of respect for human rights. We hope that lessons have been learned.Confidence in the future also requires that the other global challenge  that of poverty  be overcome. The sufferings of poverty may not be in evidence everywhere  but the challenge requires global co-operation for development. The Assembly will meet next year in a special session devoted to international economic co-operation. Soon thereafter a new international development strategy for the 1990s should be adopted. A successful special session and a new and realistic strategy should help to bring about a new spirit of international economic co-operation.In the process of preparing both the development strategy and the special session emphasis should be on the development of human resources in all forms  including the recognition of a well-functioning private sector in balance with an effective public sector. In that context funding generated by national and international sources should be well co-ordinated. The necessary investments in developing countries require increasing domestic and external financing.The debt overhang has resulted in the transfer of resources from developing countries  which exceeded $US 50 billion last year  a trend that should be reversed. This requires that a political solution  including a functioning debt strategy  be found. The debt overhang cannot be overcome by the international community at the upcoming special session of the General Assembly and in the new international development strategy. It would be important for the efforts to reverse the transfer of resources from the developing countries if the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as development-and transfer were generally reached. For its part  Finland will this year reach that target set by the General Assembly.The structure of the United Nations in the economic and social fields should respond to the tasks to be specified in the strategy for the 1990s  thus -consolidating the role of the world Organization. The Finnish Government finds that the Secretary-General has a major catalytic role to play in putting forward concrete proposals to improve the Organization's effectiveness in those fields. That would also help Governments in agreeing on the areas where they are to concentrate the activities of the United Nations in the economic and social fields. Today I wish to emphasize two issues that must  in my opinion  have a Prominent place in this respect. Development cannot be sustainable if the world population continues to grow at its present rate. Development cannot be sustainable if the natural resources of the Earth continue to be depleted at the present rate. There is a growing awareness of such problems in all parts of the world. That awareness is more and more strongly reflected in the work of the United Nations  it has prompted a number of positive measures. More is needed.According to recent United Nations estimates the world population could stabilize in the twenty-first century at the level of 10 to 11 billion persons. An early stabilisation of population growth would  of course  facilitate the fight against poverty. To reach that goal  determined population policies  translated into national population plans as spelled out in the World Population Plan of Action  should be pursued vigorously.With regard to the protection of the environment  no problem has lately becomeso apparent and widely recognized as the problem of climate change. Both industrialized and developing countries are directly affected by the depletion of the ozone layer through increasing emissions of carbon dioxides  which produce the so-called greenhouse effect in the climate of the Earth  and by the increasing presence of substances in the atmosphere that cause acid rain and direct dangers to health.It is therefore hardly a surprise that we have witnessed increasing international activity in this field. Several initiatives have been taken to launch concerted international action to combat atmospheric pollution in all its aspects  including climatic change. It is our view that effective strategies and policies should be developed by the international community as soon as possible in all fields relating to environment. That is a major undertaking that requires consolidated effort by the General Assembly and by the relevant United Nations specialized and other agencies. Environmental problems have a universal character. Any new activities should be streamlined with already ongoing action and well-established treaty-making procedures. The General Assembly must play a pivotal role in that effort.Five months ago Finland hosted a Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer aid the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Those instruments  of 1985 and 1987 respectively  have this year already been found inadequate in light of the latest advances in knowledge. At the Conference the representatives of the more than 80 States present agreed unanimously to the Helsinki Declaration on the Protection of  the Ozone Layer  which contains an ambitious undertaking to phase out completely the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000  or sooner if possible  and to phase out other ozone-depleting substances as soon as possible. We expect that undertaking to be converted into a legally binding decision at next year's meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Appropriate measures should also be undertaken to make environmentally sound substitutes widely available to developing countries as soon as possible.In the field of environment protection the problems that are typical in the industrialized countries are often also found in the big urban centres of the developing countries. The problems that are now typical in many developing countries - such as soil erosion and the destruction of forests - illustrate mistakes already committed by earlier generations  most of all in Europe. We can therefore all learn from each other. There is information available about the environment and its protection  and about earlier mistakes. The available knowledge needs to be applied and converted into practical programmes  not only on the level of global strategies  but also on the level of regional  national and local development.In our own development co-operation programmes  we in Finland have emphasized such activities as deforestation  where we feel that we have some experience and expertise. We see deforestation as urgent in order to help stop soil erosion  counteract the greenhouse effect and counterbalance the continued cutting of trees for fuel and for other immediate human needs. In this respect  the development of new and renewable soirees of energy is of crucial importance.On a broader scale  we look forward to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We see it as representing probably the most important joint effort required of mankind during the remaining part of this century. This session of the General Assembly is called upon to take important decisions for the preparation of the Conference. In that connection  as in all our activities to face up to environmental problems  we in Finland will strongly emphasize the need to support the developing countries in order to ensure that their development is environmentally sustainable.A large part of the burden  particularly for financing research and the introduction of new environmentally sound technologies  will have to be borne by the industrialized countries. We accept our part of this burden  knowing of course that all states will have to share in the efforts according to their capabilities. Since concern for the environment is global  this concern should in our opinion give a further incentive to all States without exception to involve themselvesactively in international co-operation for environmentally sound and sustainable development. We also think that the time is ripe for the preparation of structural reforms making the United Nations Organization more responsive to the problems of protecting the environment. My Government has an open mind regarding the various ideas that have been discussed. We would find it natural for this Assembly to take decisions ensuring environmental Questions a permanent and prominent place in the structure of the Organization.One of the activities of the United Nations which has rightly gained prominence during this year is peace-keeping. At the present time  Finland is the biggest contributor of personnel to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. Their total strength is close to 15 000  and the number of Finnish personnel is now almost 2 000. It is therefore with particular satisfaction that we in Finland share the pride felt in this house over the latest Nobel Peace Prize  which was awarded to the United Nations peace-keeping forces. In co-operation with the other Nordic countries  Finland has this year taken steps to share with other interested States its experiences concerning the training and preparation of national contingents for peace-keeping tasks.We are also satisfied at the reactivation of the United Nations Special Committee on Peace-keeping Operations. The accumulated experiences in this field have already grown to such an extent that it is high time indeed to make a thorough review of all practical proposals that may help to strengthen the role of the United Nations in peace-keeping.In this connection  I wish to emphasize the importance of finding a lasting solution to the financial difficulties that still affect current peace-keeping operations  thus indirectly undermining the financial basis of the whole Organization. The idea of having sufficient financial reserves for peacemaking and peace-keeping  particularly for the start-up phase of operations  which my   predecessor put forward in his address to the General Assembly last year  has received support in a number of Quarters. I note in particular that the Secretary-General  in his own report to the General Assembly  has referred to the possibility of establishing a special reserve fund for peace-keeping  to be supported by all Member States. We hope that this idea can soon be followed up in practice with full respect for the principle of collective responsibility. The first condition  in our view  is that Member states should accept the principle of financing all operations without exception through assessed contributions and that they should pay all their assessed contributions in full and on time.The principal factor explaining the recent growth in the participation of Finnish personnel in United Nations peace-keeping is the deployment of an enlarged battalion within the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. A sizable number of volunteer soldiers has thus been added to the two Finnish battalions and smaller units already serving in the Middle East and elsewhere.Namibia is a major test for the United Nations. The beginnings of the UOTAG operations to implement Security Council resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia were unexpectedly rough and difficult. It is still too early to draw conclusions from the whole process of transition to independence  but we believe that the programme has been brought back on track thanks to the persistent efforts of the Secretary-General and the competent performance of the UNTAG personnel. Of course  many problems still remain to be solved and call for our unrelenting attention. We are looking forward with confidence to the moment when we can welcome independent Namibia into our midst as a Member State of the United Nations. For Finland  Namibia will be a major partner in our development co-operation.  The situation in the Middle East continues to pose a persistent threat to international security. The dangers of the absence of peace in the area are demonstrated almost daily. Repressive measures continue in the territories illegally occupied by Israel. The cycle of violence has not been broken. Theeking turmoil in Lebanon gives cause for deep concern. There must be a way to or the suffering of the Lebanese people by the common endeavours of the Lebanese themselves  the Arab League and the international community.It is pressingly urgent that the way should be prepared towards an international peace conference and  further  to a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. There is an almost universal recognition of the basic principles for a settlement. The right of all States in the region to live within secure and recognized boundaries  as well as the right of the Palestinians to national determination  should be recognised. Democratic elections in the occupied territories could facilitate this process. If such elections are properly mentored and take place within the framework of a structured effort  they could provide a link in a process leading to a comprehensive settlement. The momentum for achieving a solution to this long-standing conflict will be lost unless all possible avenues are pursued vigorously and with an open mind. In this respect  the proposals made by President Mubarak of Egypt are welcome and merit serious consideration.The United Nations has manifestly demonstrated its relevance and strengthened its role as a forum for co-ordinated international action. Yet the world Organization and its member States can do more. Serious global problems call for urgent global solutions. Only a re-invigorated United Nations can answer the challenges the world will inevitably face in the 1990s and beyond. Let us unite our forces to make the United Nations capable of meeting those challenges. "
"50",2369,"FJI",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Republic of Fiji  I extend to Ambassador Garba our warmest congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. His unanimous election is without doubt a recognition of the esteem in which he is held personally; it concomitantly reflects the high regard we all have for his great country  the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We are confident that his distinguished leadership will guide this forty-fourth session to a most successful conclusion. And the success that we achieve at this session will strengthen the supportive climate for international relations and further instil the need to interact positively among ourselves so as to solidify the basis for permanent international peace.The General Assembly is a meeting of representatives of sovereign nations and  in a sense  is about how we can enhance relationships and co-operation  how we can promote economic and social progress and how we can live in peace with one another.The world is now poised on the threshold of the last decade of the twentieth century and we will soon enter a new millennium. But what of the old century? The twentieth century has seen mankind suffer from two global wars  one of which was described as ""the war to end all wars"". Fifty years have now passed since the Second World War and  despite only limited conflicts and a period of cold war  we have witnessed the development of massive arsenals. the positive side  we have seen phenomenal advices in science and technology  enabling man to land on land on Moon and taking him to the final frontier  space. Scientific developments have helped improve living standards  increased agricultural and industrial production  and have added years to our lives.The story of mankind is  however  not simple and our achievements will pale -to insignificance if the international co-unity cannot come to terms with itself. In this regard  it is gratifying to note that international tensions are beginning to wane  that major conflicts which have afflicted certain parts of the world appear to be in the process of resolution  in many cases using the good offices of our Secretary-General. It is a tragedy that  while the Iran-Iraq war has seen an end to fighting  People of Lebanon be subjected to a life of violence and insecurity? The United Nations  in an effort to eliminate suffering and pursue peace in Lebanon  sent what was to be an ""interim force"" which has been in that country for over 11 years. The mediation of the Tripartite High Level Arab Committee is welcomed and we earnestly hope that it can find a durable solution to the issues. Fiji continues to support the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and to a homeland  while at the same time recognizing Israel's right to exist as a State within secure boundaries. My delegation welcomes the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea. which  we earnestly hope  will lead to the restoration of peace and to reconstruction in that ravaged country. The central role of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be crucial in this regard and deserves the fullest support of the international community.It is also pleasing to note the new dialogue between the two Koreas which we sincerely hope will reduce the obstacles to peaceful reunification. However  as we have said in the past  we believe that in the meantime neither of the two should be denied the right to join this Organization.My delegation welcomes the recent developments in Namibia. It is most gratifying to see that  after years of international criticism and condemnation  South Africa has finally renounced its intransigence and agreed to let the people of Namibia achieve their cherished dream of independence. We look forward to the early admission of Namibia into the United Nations.My delegation renews its call to South Africa to bring a speedy end to the abhorrent and inhuman policy of apartheid and grant to the black South African people their right to play an effective role in the government of their country. We will continue to support the measures being pursued by the international community to dismantle apartheid in South Africa  including the banning of sports contacts with South Africa.We welcome the recent initiatives being taken to bring peace and stability to Central America. As I said earlier  the twentieth century could be looked upon as the century of world wars. The creation of the League of Nations and its successor  the United Nations  clearly manifested man's desire not merely for lasting peace  but also for social and economic benefits for all mankind. And while with all our hearts we sincerely desire permanent and secure peace  ironically  this noble objective has continued to elude us.It has been argued that the possession of arsenals of nuclear weapons has created a regime of peace based on a balance of nuclear power. But the build-up of nuclear weapons only takes us closer to the edge of the holocaust. It is therefore important that the dialogue  discussions and active reduction of nuclear weapons should continue.My country is committed to permanent and secure peace in our world. In pursuit of that commitment  Fiji has fully supported the United Nations in its peace-keeping activities. We have contributed troops for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and for the United Nations good Offices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP) and  most recently  policemen for the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia. Some 23 of my countrymen have paid the ultimate price while serving under the banner of the United Nations. Decolonisation  which has been one of the outstanding achievements of the United Nations  is reaching its final hour. My delegation welcomes the positive developments in New Caledonia. We are confident that France will honour the commitment made in the Matignon Agreement to give the people of that Territory the right to exercise their will through a free and genuine act of self-determination in accordance with the principles and practices established by the United Nations.We are  however  indeed sorry that when that day comes one of the champions of the independence movement in New Caledonia  Mr. Jean Marie Tjibaou  will not be there to witness it. We in the Pacific were shocked to learn of the assassination of Mr. Tjibaou with his Deputy  Mr. Yeiwene. Mr. Tjibaou had become a familiar figure in the corridors of the United Nations  championing with dignity and forcefulness the cause of his people. He will be missed by us all.The South Pacific is a relatively calm and peaceful region. We have pursued a number of initiatives to ensure maintenance of that situation. For example  we have established the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty - or the Treaty of Rarotonga  as it is more commonly known. Regrettably  however  France continues to carry out nuclear testing in the region. Its action has earned the strongest condemnation by all countries in the South Pacific. When the French Prime Minister visited Fiji last month  I reiterated our concern when I told him:""If I were to ask only one thing of you  Mr. Prime Minister  my plea would be simples please put an end to your nuclear-testing programme in the Pacific"". Many of the Pacific Island countries depend almost entirely on the sea for their sustenance. Continued nuclear testing seriously threatens the resources on which they depend.Another danger posed to our food supply and economic sustenance is the indiscriminate exploitation of our marine resources by drift-net fishing or the ""wall of death"" constructed by distant water fishing fleets. It is the unanimous position of the South Pacific Forum that this practice must stop.There is a third danger which threatens our environment. The phenomenon called ""the greenhouse effect"" or ""global warming"" is likely to cause a rise in sea levels which would submerge many of the low-lying islands in the Pacific and elsewhere. This issue must continue to be addressed by the international community as a matter or urgency.It is important for us to preserve  protect and promote our indigenous natural resources. And if it is important for us to preserve and protect our indigenous natural resources  then it is even more important for us to protect our indigenous human resources  our indigenous and tribal peoples - their special rights  their traditions  their culture.In that regard  the international community has been concerned about these issues. The rights of indigenous and tribal peoples are guaranteed and protected under the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention of 1957 and under the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries of 1989. Permit me to make a few remarks on the situation in my country. At the heart of the two military actions in 1987 in Fiji were the concern and fear of the indigenous Fijian people about their future. The indigenous Fijians settled in the islands of Fiji more than 3 500 years ago. Immigration into Fiji during the early part of the British colonial administration led to a situation where  before the founding of the United Nations  the indigenous Fijian people had become a minority in their own country. With the abrogation of the 1970 Constitution in October 1987 and the institution of an interim civilian Government in December 1987  there began the sensitive task of drafting a new Constitution which would guarantee and protect the special rights of the indigenous Fijian people while at the same time addressing the rights and interests of the other communities in Fiji. The Interim Government prepared a draft Constitution. Subsequently  a Constitutional inquiry and Advisory Committee was set up to receive the views and opinions of the people on a new Constitution. This 16-member Committee was made up of eminent persons in Fiji; it comprised six Indians  five Fijians  four from other races and one Rotuman  who was the Chairman. After conducting hearings throughout the country and receiving written and oral submissions over a period of eight months  and after deliberating over its report for a further three months  the Committee submitted a unanimous report to the Interim Government. It recommended  inter alia  a two-chamber parliament of Fiji - a house of representatives comprising 37 Fijians  27 Indians  four from other races and one Rotuman; and a 34-member senate consisting of chiefs and prominent citizens from other communities.The Interim Government released the report of the Constitutional inquiry and Advisory Committee for public information earlier this month. The Fiji Times  independently controlled and the only English daily newspaper in Fiji at the time  said in its editorial:	""The Constitutional inquiry and Advisory Committee has produced a generally balanced report after an exhaustive nation-wide enquiry. It is certainly not going to please everyone but the Committee  working within its terms of reference  has presented a compromise package that it hopes will be acceptable to all different communities ...""It recognizes that its package is by no means perfect - that is why it recommends a review within seven years - but makes out a strong case for its acceptance now as a workable document  and workable it is""."
"51",2416,"FRA",44,1989,"ï»¿I am speaking on behalf of the European Economic Community. Mr. President  allow me in my turn to extend to you on behalf of the European Community and its member States warmest congratulations on your unanimous election to the office of President of the General Assembly. Your experience in international affairs  your perfect familiarity with the United Nations system and your personal qualities particularly qualify you to occupy that important office. We have no doubt that those attributes will enable you to work wonders.Let me also include in this tribute your predecessor at the head of the Assembly  Mr. Dante Caputo. The energy and efficiency with which he discharged that office merit the gratitude of the entire Organization.I should like also  on behalf of the Twelve  to assure the Secretary-General of our unswerving and unqualified support in his weighty task  and to express our admiration for his untiring activity throughout the world in favour of peace.The European Community and its member States have always considered that they have a special contribution to make to the efforts being made to build a more just and peaceful world bound by ever-closer ties of solidarity.I should now like to put forward a few thoughts about the main thrust of our external action  by pointing to our common struggle for peace  the outlook for economic development and the fight against the scourges inflicted on our societies by human rights violations  terrorism and drug abuse.I should like first to say a few words about the hopes that have been kindled by developments in the year gone by. while the progress made is still too fragile for the international community to be certain that it will soon see the dawn of peace break upon the world  and while tensions still exist or are worsening here and there and indeed new conflicts are emerging  the fact is that  all in all  the cause of peace has advanced more than it probably ever has done in recent times.In relations between the eastern and western parts of Europe  recent developments suggest that the deep wounds of history  once considered as incurable  are now beginning to heal. On both sides  a common language is enabling us to talk to one another  negotiate and reach agreements that only a short time ago seemed beyond our grasp.The European Council has sought to give fresh impetus to East-West relations  as this is warranted by the changes towards greater political and economic freedom that have taken place in the Soviet Union and several Central and Eastern European countries  notably Poland and Hungary. While we must regret that there remain serious violations of human rights in some of those countries  how could we fail to welcome the reforms on which they have embarked and support and encourage them when they are quite plainly contributing to overcoming the divisions of the last War at a pace and on a scale hitherto unprecedented in Europe.The proceedings of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe are closely bound up with that prospect. Since the adoption of a closing document last January in Vienna  two key meetings - the Information Forum in London and the first session of the Conference on the Human Dimension in Paris - have made it possible to take greater advantage of the scope of the Helsinki process to advance the cause of fundamental freedoms  the rule of law and the values of democracy.As for the negotiations on measures aimed at building confidence and security and on conventional forces in Europe  whose purpose is to remove the imbalances liable to undermine the stability and security of the continent  they have taken a decisive turn  and there are hopes that in the coming months significant progress can be made which would have major importance for the future of East-West relations.In the broader setting of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  there have been encouraging results following the impetus created by the Conference on chemical disarmament held in Paris in January 1989. The Twelve would like to see the conclusion at the earliest possible opportunity of a comprehensive  verifiable treaty banning chemical weapons. The results achieved in that field at the recent United States-Soviet meetings are a most encouraging sign in this respect.By the same token  I welcome the progress announced yesterday by the President of the United states and moments ago by the Soviet Foreign Minister with regard to their bilateral negotiations on reducing by half their stockpiles of strategic weapons. We hope there will be an early outcome to these negotiations and that the significant gains of the past  such as the anti-ballistic missile Treaty  will be preserved.But Europe is not the only theatre in the struggle for peace  to which our Organization attaches universal significance. Encouraging signs have emerged in many parts of the world  holding out promise of the settlement of some conflicts. The utmost must be done to give added impetus to those favourable develops  and the Twelve are setting about that task.In Namibia  the process towards independence and peace is under way. The twelve unreservedly support the action of the Secretary-General and earnestly call on all the parties not to impede the movement towards peace. The European community stands ready to welcome an independent Namibia among its partners under the Lome Convention.The rewarding dialogue started with the front-line States  notably in Luxembourg last June  shows that everyone aspires to an early settlement of these long-standing conflicts which have delayed or thwarted the region's development plans. Here again  the Community is more than ready to foster reconstruction and  whether it be in Angola  Mozambique or elsewhere  to help the population build a new era of peace. In that connection  the Community and its member States have always insisted on the need to put an end to the apartheid system and bring about the establishment of a just  democratic society in South Africa. I shall come back to that basic demand.The Twelve are particularly attentive to the implementation of the Secretary-General's peace plan for Western Sahara  which is expected to lead to a referendum on self-determination and holds out hopes for a settlement of this issue. They are convinced that the creation of the Arab Maghreb Union will contribute to that end.Through the recent Tela agreements  the countries of Central America have demonstrated their determination to take their destiny in their own hands. This is a source of satisfaction to us. The success of the exercise will depend on the different parties abiding by the undertakings they have given. It is also envisaged that the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) will lend their support to the implementation of the peace agreements.The Community and its member States wish to pay a tribute to the sense of moderation and dialogue displayed by the Central American Heads of State  moved as they have been by the spirit of democracy. The San Pedro Sula Conference  held in February 1989  showed the determination of the European Community and the Contadora group of countries to give their support to the process of negotiation and economic integration which the Central American Governments have set as their goals.The Twelve also note with satisfaction the progress made by democracy in SouthAmerica  and especially the prospect of positive developments in Chile  heralded by free elections.Since the announcement of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  which was welcomed by the entire international community  the Secretary-General has  with the Twelve's support  pursued his endeavours to ensure that the negotiations move progressively towards a final settlement. But we should not be content with the current ""no war - no peace"" situation. The Twelve accordingly wish to launch an appeal to the Governments of the two countries to contribute to the efforts of theSecretary-General and his colleagues to transform the present armistice into a lasting peace and to lose no more time in fully implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1987).The Twelve express the hope that the Iranian leaders will demonstrate their readiness to contribute to international life in a constructive and peaceful manner consonant with the norms governing relations among States  so that that country can again take its rightful place in its region and in the international community at large.The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan was a necessary  but not sufficient  condition for a political solution. As long as the conflict continues  there will still be a need for all the Afghan parties to seek ways and means of bringing about a genuine process of self-determination  leading to the formation of a fully representative government and the existence of a truly independent and non-aligned Afghanistan. The Twelve confirm their support for the United Nations Secretary-General in the efforts he is making to facilitate a settlement  in the hope that the refugees will be able to return to their homes in freedom and dignity  the Community and its member States stand ready  once a settlement has been reached  to contribute to the reconstruction of Afghanistan  in the same way as they are already contributing to the humanitarian assistance being provided for the long-suffering people of that country.In Cambodia  signs have emerged in recent months  albeit tentatively  of a possible return to peace. The Twelve have welcomed the decision of Viet Nam to withdraw its troops and consider that their withdrawal has made it possible to seek an overall political solution to the Cambodian conflict. The Twelve's support could not but encourage France to take the initiative of convening an international conference in Paris  with the co-presidency of Indonesia  bringing together all the Khmer parties and the countries most directly involved  in the presence of the UN Secretary General. Although the meeting did not make it possible to reach an agreement  it can be said to have marked a very important turning point in the search for a peaceful solution. The process which has now started should be pursued  with the requisite determination  with the aim of arriving at least at an overall settlement guaranteeing the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and neutrality of Cambodia and enabling the Cambodian people to control its own destiny through free end internationally supervised elections. The temptation of the different parties involved to seek a solution in the field still by force of arms could lead only to a stalemate.The Twelve are convinced that the only way out of this long-drawn-out conflict lies in dialogue and national reconciliation. The continuing instability in that region is also adding to the tragedy of the Vietnamese boat people. The Twelve share the determination of the Secretary-General and the international community to find a solution to this problem. In the case of the Korean peninsula. we should like again to voice the hope that  in accordance with the principle of universality enshrined in our Organization  the Korean people may enjoy full representation in the United Nations at an early date.The progress that has been accomplished and the stronger conviction we now have that peace is possible everywhere can only strengthen our resolve to work the Middle East. In the Middle East at a time when  on the Palestinian  side  a number of important decisions have opened up fresh prospects for a realistic search for a settlement of the Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question  no real progress has yet been made in responding to those moves. Yet the passage of time is not working to anybody's advantage. Let us beware of the disappointment that is bound to be aroused by such missed opportunities.The Community is making the same message plain to one and all: if a peace settlement is to be reached  then it is necessary to recognize  both in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world  the right of all States  and of Israel in particular  to security and the right of all peoples to justice - in other words  the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  with everything which that implies. In the Community's view  the appropriate way to attain those goals remains the organization of an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations.The situation in the occupied territories provides a dramatic illustration of the effects of the lack of progress in seeking a settlement. The measures taken against the population in those territories - the continued closure of the universities  the expulsions  the extension and increase in the number of detentions on administrative grounds - have prompted the Twelve to appeal yet again to the Israeli authorities to abide by their obligations as the occupying Power  in accordance with the Security Council resolutions.The Twelve  in the Madrid Declaration  have made their position known on the Israeli plan for organizing elections and granting provisional self-governing status to the territories. For the impact of such elections to be really meaningful  they should form part of a comprehensive settlement process based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the application of the principle of land for peace  and they should be held with adequate guarantees of freedom throughout the occupied territories  including East Jerusalem. In the same spirit and on the basis of the same principles  the Twelve welcome Egypt's contribution to the peace process  as set out in the 10 Points  which President Mubarak has Put forward. The Twelve hope that this willmake it possible  in particular  to set in motion the necessary dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.Without waiting for the settlement which  they so earnestly desire  the Community and its member states plan to step up their cooperation with the occupied territories and to develop their program of assistance to the population  which has suffered so severely from the continuing occupation and its attendant restrictions. I now  wish to refer to Lebanon. In Lebanon  the tragedy of a nation that has been torn apart has lasted for 14 years now. Never has the suffering been so great as over the past few months  nor the battles so bloody  nor the ordeals borne by everybody so horrendous.It is this that has prompted the Community and its Member States to call for an effective cease-fire and the lifting of the blockades and for a start to be made towards a process of national reconciliation ensuring the full restoration of Lebanese sovereignty on the basis of fresh institutions. They have constantly given their support to the moves made by the Arab League  which were initially led by the Committee of Six and subsequently by that of the three Heads of State. They welcome that top-level Committee's resumption of its mission  which they fully support  and hope that once the parties have all agreed to its proposals  dialogue and the quest for peace will prevail.It is now essential that  at a moment when dialogue is being renewed  all Lebanese parties be freed from external pressures so that they may be able to agree on a new system for living side by side  one that takes into account the existing demographic and social situation. Through the introduction of such a system and the withdrawal of all foreign forces - with the exception of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) - Lebanon must regain its full sovereignty  independence  unity and territorial integrity. This is what France has been endeavouring to do  and will continue to do with the support of its partners in the Community  while making it its constant concern to support the Arab moves led by the Tripartite Committee until hope is rekindled in Lebanon.At the same time the Community and its member States have signified their solidarity with the entire Lebanese people by undertaking an assistance programme aimed at alleviating their suffering and at contributing to the restoration of normal living conditions and the resumption of economic and social activities.We cannot speak of Lebanon without referring to the fate of the hostages  several of whom are nationals of the Community's member States. How can we forget Colonel Higgins  who was serving the United Nations? The Twelve condemn the taking of hostages  which must be fought with all the means at our disposal in the spirit of the relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council. The Twelve wish to appeal to those countries which might be able to exert some influence in secure the liberation of the hostages.I should like to state the Community's unchanging position with regard to Cyprus  a member of the European family. The Twelve call on all the parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General and his Representative on the spot with a view to overcoming the existing obstacles and finding the paths to dialogue. The Twelve ask them not to let slip the opportunity now available for a just and lasting settlement that will safeguard the independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and unity of Cyprus in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.We all know that world peace is a sacred cause. It warrants all the energy and resolve we can devote to it. It calls for determination and obstinacy. We may. no doubt  feel rather discouraged when no sooner has one hotbed of tension died down than others flare up  for we are then dogged by feelings of hopelessness  like those which Sisyphus may be felt at the top of his mountain before the stone started to roll down again.And yet  hope remains alive when the chain of men and women epitomized by our Assembly are still linked together in the service of peace. We know that that unremitting task is a collective one and that progress cannot be made unless we are all mobilized.Hence it is with the same determination  the same degree of hope and the same trust in good fortune that we have to tackle other conflicts and other areas of tension  evidence of further rifts here and there.I should here like to turn to the case of those two countries  Senegal and Mauritania  which were living in harmony and united by a common design  but which have suddenly been rocked by violence to the point where they have now become brother enemies. Can Senegal and Mauritania soon return to the path of understanding and dialogue? The Twelve earnestly hope so. This is why they are supporting the mediation efforts of President Mubarak and hope that conciliation and reason will prevail.Other tragedies are being played out. In Ethiopia  where the civil war continues to rage bringing in its wake a host of displaced populations  suffering and poverty  prospects for dialogue seem nevertheless to be emerging. The Twelve hope to do all they can to pave the way for negotiation and reconciliation. The same holds true for the Sudan and Somalia.In this connexion I should like to pay a tribute to the action of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)  whose work everyone considers irreplaceable.Lastly  I should like to mention the hopes aroused by the discussions between the Governments at Colombo and New Delhi in a bid to restore peace and national unity in Sri Lanka. In the case of East Timor  the Twelve reaffirm their support for the contacts between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General. They hope that early progress will lead to a just and comprehensive settlement  accepted internationally.The cause of peace is making progress in spite of everything  as we can see  and our Assembly bears special witness to the fact. It is making progress through multilateral and bilateral dialogue  through the readiness of States to renounce war in settling their differences  and through the action of the United Nations in every instance where its mediation is imperative. The Twelve intend to associate themselves fully with this ever renewed task and they will play a major role in quelling conflicts  by reasons  I would say  of their very nature and calling  and through the example they are setting through the agreement among them and their prospective union.Yet peace-making  the reduction of tensions and the banishment of violence cannot be dissociated from the struggle against the inequalities marking international economic development. We must take care - I say again - not to provoke new trouble spots that might be stirred up by the revolt of the poor. We must make sure that growth world-wide is shared more fairly and is more balanced and more geared to coping with the abject poverty of those countries which have few natural endowments or which have been ill-treated by history or crushed by the burden of debt. Action in favour of growth and development is  more than ever  an integral part of the struggle for peace. The Community has made that fact a key feature of its relations with the rest of the world.Since the beginning of the 1980s  economic growth has recovered and has brought about a sharp increase in trade. Our aim is to consolidate that trend while at the same time continuing the struggle against inflation and unemployment. We have to ensure that everybody benefits from the movement. The fact that whole regions  in particular in Africa and Latin America  are continuing to lag behindwould reduce all efforts to naught if priority were not given to North-South solidarity.As the world's foremost trading power and its leading provider of aid  the European Community considers that tangible steps have to be taken in the three key areas of international economic co-operation  development and the environment  about which I shall now say a few words.In recent years Europe  together with Japan and a number of other Asian partners  has progressively taken over the momentum formerly generated by growth in the United States. Such growth is healthy and is the outcome of efforts of investment and modernization and the determined and convergent action of member States to hold down inflation and  above all  to finalize the establishment of the internal market by 1993.This internal market will not be self-contained. The Europe of 1993 will be a ""Europe of partners"". The programme for finalizing the creation of the internal market will not entail any weakening of the Community's international obligations. All its multilateral or bilateral commitments are and will be respected. It is in our very interest to preserve and encourage a free and open trading system.All Europe's partners will benefit from the single market of 1993 as a result of the dismantling of frontiers  the improvement of access procedures and the greater degree of transparency. The economic growth generated by the merger of 12 markets into a single market of 320 million consumers will work to the advantage of everybody when it is borne in mind that imports  which already account for one quarter of its gross domestic product  are expected to progress even further.In more specific areas  the efforts deployed by the Community at the internal level will also have positive effects for third countries. For instance  the progressive accomplishment of economic and monetary union - which will be one of our major priorities in the coming months - will be instrumental in contributing to the stability of the international monetary system.The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy  on which work started five years ago  is continuing  it is contributing to the improvement of the world market situation. The Co-unity reaffirms the undertakings it gave at the mid-term meeting of the Uruguay Round negotiations in April 1989. The efforts it is makingare considerable  and I would recall that it remains the world's largest importer of agricultural products.In 1989 the Community has continued to strengthen its relations with all the regions of the world. First  it is making preparations with the European Free Trade Association for a renewed framework for dialogue and co-operation. Then  a series of agreements have been concluded with the countries of Eastern Europe: with Hungary  Czechoslovakia and  even more recently  with Poland  to which Commissioner Adriessen and myself paid a visit. Developments in this last-named country make it increasingly urgent to dispatch the aid that was decided on at the Summit of the Arch and accepted by 24 countries. We must force the pace to respond to the extent of the need.Negotiations are being conducted with the Soviet Union and Bulgaria  and are being envisaged with the German Democratic Republic. This is the basis on which the Community plans to engage in a variety of forms of co-operation to supplement that in which its member States are already engaging.The creation of the Arab Maghreb Union will enable the European Economic to step up and diversify the already very rewarding relations it maintains with those Mediterranean countries. Discussions are proceeding with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council for the purpose of supplementing the Cooperation Agreed signed in 1988 by means Of a fresh trade agreement.In Asia  1989 has been a year marked by new joint steps taken by the EEC and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN  in their bid to further industrial cooperation by stepping up investments. With its Latin American partners  the Community is pursuing its efforts to diversify cooperation and trade. in Central America  it is developing it cooperation under the San Jose Agreements  thereby enhancing the efforts being made by the countries of the isthmus.Lastly  I should like to express my deep satisfaction at the improvement in the Community's trade relations with its main partners in the developed world  where willingness to negotiate is now the overriding consideration.This improvement in the climate is fragile  and our best chance of consolidating it is to complete the Uruguay Round negotiations by the date scheduled and to secure substantive results in all areas.In the coming months  North-South solidarity will be in the international headlines: the renewal of the lome Convention  the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on economic cooperation and development  the second international conference on the least developed countries in Paris  and the launching of the fourth development decade.Let us grasp the opportunity offered by these various occasions  for they will make it possible to take stock of what has been achieved and also to realize that we need to go further. Development depends to a large degree on the domestic strategies adopted by the countries concerned themselves. A large number of developing countries have embarked on a courageous adjustment process that is an essential requirement  even though it may sometimes give rise to problems from the social and political standpoints. I wish to pay tribute to their efforts which often demand heavy sacrifices.However  these efforts will be useful only if they are made in a favourable international environment. In the first place  it is absolutely essential to lighten the burden of excessive indebtedness which has now become intolerable. In this crucial area  the concerted and constructive approach that has prevailed has already made it possible to overcome the inhibiting factors and to record some measure of progress.Several of the Community's  member States have taken additional steps in favour of the poorest countries by cancelling official development assistance loans. France  for its part  has announced through the President of the Republic an across-the-board cancellation of the debts accruing from development assistance in the case of 35 of the poorest African entries. This measure will come into force on 1 January 1990 and is - I must say here - free of any conditions.At the same time  other countries which are certainly not as poor but which are grappling with a heavy burden of indebtedness to the banks are having to face difficult political and economic choices. This is particularly the case in Latin America where solving the debt problem should make it possible to consolidate and strengthen democracy in the region. Two countries  Mexico and the Philippines  have already successfully embarked on that path. But progress in coping with indebtedness cannot be sufficient in itself to ensure development  and fresh resources are necessary. Such resources must  in the first instance  be generated by trade. The Community has already  to a large extent  opened up its market to products from the developing countries  without awaiting the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  it has recently made significant improvements in the access of tropical products to its market.In the ongoing renegotiation of the Lome Convention  it will endeavour to improve further an arrangement that is already proving advantageous. Even so  for the vast majority of the developing countries  dependent as they are on a handful of export comities  access to the markets of the industrialized countries is not enough. The Common Fund for commodities  should now come into force. For its part  the Community plans to strengthen the STABEX and SYSMIN mechanisms for the stabilization of export earnings under the Lome Convention.Alongside these measures  official development assistance still represents a lifeline  and the Community is already making a considerable effort in that regard. The assistance proved by its member States taken together has been quite clearly moving in the direction of the 0.7 per cent target since the early 1980s.In the final analysis  however  economic development hinges on an unfailing international mobilization of forces to protect our environment. The heating up of the atmosphere  the deterioration of the ozone layer  the pollution of the oceans and freshwater resources and desertification - all pose a threat to our entire planet.Contending with this threat at an early date is a responsibility that is incumbent upon all of us.Many developing countries do not always have sufficient funds for that purpose. An effort by the industrialized countries to introduce new forms of co-operation and financing will make it easier for the individual countries in the world to take care of the environment and to manage their natural resources in a common endeavour. This must surely be one of the most necessary forms that international solidarity can take.Such solidarity is exemplary when it takes the form of protecting the tropical forests  helping Bangladesh to combat the incalculable consequences of flooding  or setting up an observatory in the Sahara.The planetary scale of the threat is such that international negotiations are needed to spell out the objectives of common interest.With that prospect in mind  the conference on the environment and development  which the United Nations Secretary-General is convening in 1992  will represent a major turning-point. Before then  the world climate conference which will take place in 1990 should afford an opportunity for making significant progress on the question of the greenhouse effect. The Community earnestly calls for the conclusion of an international agreement on climatic changes  and it would also like a dialogue to be started on ocean-bed mining. The Community has already taken  or is about to take  a number of decisions having immediate effects the early implementation  and at a faster pace  of the Helsinki decisions on the eradication of chlorofluorocarbons; the launching of a programme of action on the greenhouse effect; accession to the Basle Convention on movements of dangerous waste; the creation of a European environmental agency and the drawing-up of a tropical forest assistance programme.These actions  coupled with support for the current international negotiations and with the integration of environmental issues into co-operation with the developing countries  are indicative of the Community's growing commitment to the preservation of our planetary environment.There are other threats that also call for our vigilance and decisive action. We likewise cannot keep silent at the violations of mankind's most fundamental freedoms and rights. There are many such violations and they unfortunately continue to exist in too many countries on all the continents.The Twelve are constantly waging war on behalf of human rights  which are the foundation of the United Nations  for they cannot remain indifferent to the intolerable violations to which those rights are being subjected. It is not that they are trying to behave as a censor  rather their fight is inspired by the values which underpin the Community and have brought its member States together.The events of Tiananmen Square are still present in our memories  we may ask whether the European Community's relations with Beijing have been compromised for a long time to case. We sincerely hope that this will not be the case. We shall show vigilance  however  in the hope that the leaders of the People's Republic of China will eventually heed the appeals addressed to them by the entire international community. We also attach considerable importance to ensuring that China fully abides by the undertakings it has given in respect of the constitutional instruments for Hong Kong.The Twelve wish to launch a further appeal for the Burmese people to be allied freely to exercise its right of expression.Free elections have been held in Panama also. The Twelve are giving their support to the efforts of the Organization of American States to put forward a solution to the crisis  they reaffirm their reservations about the new regime currently in power  which does not enjoy any form of institutional legitimacy.I turn now to South Africa - yet again. It has to be asked whether the winds of change bluing over southern Africa as a whole will also have a positive impact in South Africa. The Twelve  which have constantly denounced the particularly odious apartheid regime  have taken note of the statements made by the South African leaders asserting their determination to embark on reforms. However  thetwelve likewise note - and deplore - the extension of the state of emergency  the continuing ban on anti-apartheid organizations  the pursuit of repression and the continued detention of a large number of political prisoners  starting with Nelson Mandela. They will not let up the pressure until the aims being sought have been attained.Violations of human rights are the blight of international relations  the leprosy of modern times. The Assembly has been witness to the emergence of the most admirable legal instruments and high-minded resolutions  which every State has accepted. How can one not speak here of the emotion of people who are suffering and whose hopes have been suddenly dashed in the face of brute force and the abuse of authority or merely a lack of understanding at man's relentless and courageous march towards freedom? I should like to pay tribute to the Commission on Human Rights  which is striving with all its might to win respect for the values enshrined in the United Nations. This year the Commission has submitted two particularly important drafts to the Assembly  after some years spent on thedifficult task of putting them together. These are the draft of the second optional protocol covering the abolition of the death penalty and the draft of a convention on the rights of the child. I hope that final consultations will permit the General Assembly to adopt these two drafts by consensus at this session.Respect for freedom cannot be dissociated from the rejection of terrorism. Resorting to the barbaric practices of terrorism is unwarranted  whatever the circumstances. All terrorists have to be brought to justice. That means that every country must adopt a very firm attitude and that there has to be a concerted response.With the early prospect of the creation of a Community area without internal borders  there is increased collaboration between the agencies responsible for public order in the Twelve  which consider that  as the threat stands at present  there are no grounds for relaxing their vigilance.But there is another challenge to democratic values which cannot go un-mentioned: the scourge of drug abuse. The tragic events in Colombia last month  when the drug traffickers demonstrated their deadly power  have once again underscored the need to strengthen international cooperation in the fight against drugs. I wish to pay tribute to the authorities of Colombia for their coverage. The Community gives its full backing to them and to the measures taken by the President of the United States. Over and above the action being taken at the regional level  the Twelve consider that an effective solution to drug problems has to be sought in an international context involving producer countries  consumer countries and the countries of transit. It is with that in mind that the Twelve consider that the right forum for this purpose is the United Nations  with its Commission on Narcotic Drugs and the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control  and that they have contributed to the adoption of the new United Nations Convention against illicit drug trafficking  opened for signature on 20 December 1988.The Community attaches the utmost importance to the work of the United Nations  as demonstrated by its very active participation in peace-keeping operations. That is why our first concern is to see the efficiency of the United  Nations enhanced and to learn about the initial results of the reforms undertaken for that purpose.This is the first time that it has fallen to France  which is the current President of the Council of the European Communities  to speak in this capacity before the Assembly on behalf of the Europe of the Twelve. I am conscious of the honour that has been done to me. In France's eyes  the European Community is a very great undertaking whose scope it readily adopts as its own. I hope that the Community's identity will grow stronger as it increasingly opens to the world. Through its voice in international organizations and the presence and action of the ""troika"" when urgent issues arise  the Community sends out a message of peace from its own people to the other peoples of the world. I am happy to have been able to speak on behalf of Europe.Allow me  in conclusion  to say a few words on behalf of my own country. The ardent desire for peace  the aspiration for progress and the sacred defence of the law all represent  for every man and woman on our planet  the sum total of hope that no force on earth can ever stifle. That is the significance of the steps which France has taken in 1989  with the Conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons  action on human rights  action on behalf of Lebanon  and the Paris Conference on Cambodia. That is also why France has resolutely chosen  in the family of nations  to support the most impoverished and least favoured peoples. On the threshold of the year 2000  we are faced with and involved in fresh struggles. Let us wage them without beating around the bush and without asking futile questions. Future generations will judge us by the manner in which we have responded to the major challenges of the present  such as the threat to the environment  the crushing poverty of millions of human beings  and the violation of rights and freedoms.   The key word in response to all these problems is .is solidarity. It is France's fervent hope that voices will speak out in unison from this prestigious forum to enjoin the international community to give fresh impetus everywhere to dialogue  development and peace."
"52",2484,"GAB",44,1989,"ï»¿The sessions of the General Assembly of our Organization offer Government officials such as ourselves the solemn opportunity both to give the views of our respective countries on the status of the world and to take a look at prospects for its future. I myself am particularly honoured to address the Assembly for the first time on behalf of my country  Gabon.1 should like first of all to discharge the pleasant duty of conveying to President Joseph Garba  the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations  on behalf of His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo  the President of Gabon  and on my own behalf  the warmest fraternal congratulations of the Gabonese people on his brilliant election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The confidence thus demonstrated shows the esteem he enjoys among us  and is a tribute to his outstanding qualities as a man well versed in international affairs and his commitment to the Special Committee against Apartheid  which he chairs. The President may rest assured that in this body the Gabonese delegation will be guided by its firm determination to make a sincere contribution to the success of our work.It is my delegation's conviction that under the presidency of Joseph Garba the deliberations of the Assembly will proceed in the spirit of the principles and purposes of the Charter of our Organization for the achievement of a just and equitable world.We should also like to congratulate the members of the Bureau  who are working with the President to ensure the success of our deliberations. We take pleasure in availing ourselves of this opportunity to thank Mr. Garba's predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  and his Bureau for the invaluable work they did during the forty-third session.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  my country would like to pay a well-deserved tribute for the self-sacrifice  talent and complete dedication he has shown in carrying out his difficult tasks. By way of illustration I would mention his recent visit to southern Africa  as well as his participation in both the twenty-fifth summit of the Organization of African Unity and the ninth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement.With the experience it has acquired from the various trials  tribulations and upheavals that have taken place since its creation  our Organization is more than ever aware of its place and its responsibilities with regard to the destiny of mankind. Each of us must become aware of the need for all Members to take part in world decisions in this body  for without a doubt the United Nations remains  the centre for the harmonizing of the actions of nations in the attainment of common ends.The signing of the American-Soviet agreement of 8 December 1987 on the dismantling of intermediate-range nuclear missiles? the conclusions of the Belgrade summit last September  and the determination then restated by the non-aligned countries to work towards the building of a better world; the very recent American and Soviet proposals for the elimination of chemical weapons? the tireless activities of the United Nations in these spheres - all have given rise to a climate of detente and confidence truly propitious for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts.The same applies to Afghanistan  and Gabon hopes that  following the Geneva agreements  as well as the withdrawal of foreign troops  an international and national consensus might emerge to enable the Afghan people to express its legitimate aspirations and devote its resources to the rebuilding of its country without external interference of any kind.As regards Cambodia  we take pleasure in noting with interest the role played by the ASEAN countries at the Jakarta meetings  and the first peace initiative of France  which has led to the creation of three so-called monitoring  safeguard and refugee committees  as well as to the establishment of an ad hoc committee. The mission of inquiry of the Secretary-General in Cambodia  as well as the establishment of machinery for international monitoring  are not only a useful tool but also and above all a prerequisite for a return to peace in that country.Concerning the Korean peninsula  my country has always worked for peaceful unification in a framework of sincere joint efforts that take into account the will of the Korean people as a whole  a necessary prerequisite for the genuine representation of that country in our Organization.Taking advantage of the overall climate of detente  the parties to the Iran-Iraq conflict have agreed to negotiate in Geneva on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We can only welcome this  while exhorting the two parties to commit themselves to doing their utmost to help the Secretary-General in the full implementation of that resolution. That is how they can show their true willingness to achieve peace.As regards the Middle East crisis  my country has always held the view that its settlement requires the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the Arab occupied territories  de jure recognition of the PIO as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and free exercise by the latter of its right to self-determination  and its right to have its own State with internationally recognized borders. Gabon  then  fully subscribes to the idea of an international peace conference on the Middle East under the aegis of the United Nations  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.I commend here the excellent relations Palestine has had with my country  which were manifested in the opening in 1986  in Libreville  of Palestinian diplomatic representation.We cannot talk about the situation in the Middle East without dealing with the painful problem of Lebanon because above and beyond the ordeal suffered by its people for more than 15 years  it is Lebanon's survival  that should concern us today. Gabon  therefore welcomes the resumption of the work of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League on Lebanon  which should form part of overall broad-based diplomatic action  and supports its efforts to find a lasting solution to this real human tragedy.As regards the situation in Central America  Gabon hails the conclusion of the Esquipulas II and Tela agreements  which pave the way for the return of peace to that region. It also welcomes the Security Council's firm support for these agreements  which should facilitate the achievement of the objectives set forth in the plan.I could not conclude this part of my statement without touching on the conflicts that beset our dear continent of Africa.As regards the Chad-Libya border dispute  the Heads of State and Government  at the twenty-fifth summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  renewed the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee  which has been chaired by my country since 1977.I take pleasure in emphasizing in this connection that the recent conclusion in Algiers of the framework agreement on the settlement of the Chad-Libya border dispute is the logical culmination of the various initiatives of the Ad Hoc Committee and its Chairman. At the twenty-fourth summit of the OAU His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo proposed that pride of place be given  as a necessary prerequisite for peace  to the establishment of a climate of confidence between the two countries and the dynamics of dialogue  bringing the two parties together  which would be very significant. The Angolan issue  also  was dealt with by Heads of State of the African sub region  including the President of Gabon  and they reaffirmed their support for the plan for peace and reconciliation in Angola formulated in the Gbadolite declarations.In international terms  Gabon would like to express its satisfaction to those countries that have provided military observers and international officials  and to the United Nations for all its technical assistance for the verification mission in Angola. As regards Namibia  my country welcomes the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of that territory. Furthermore  we express full appreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts within the framework of Security Council resolutions 629 (1989) and 632 (1989) and urge the South African authorities to co-operate with the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in their implementation.Finally  we are grateful to the Security Council for its vigilance  shown recently in resolution 640 (1989)  whereby it requires that all parties concerned  especially South Africa  comply  among other things  with the provisions of resolution 435 (1978).The process of Namibia's accession to international sovereignty - long overdue - is today irreversible. The desperate manoeuvres at intimidation of the civilian population and the attacks against the leaders of the South West Africa People's Organization - all plots hatched by a minority of proponents with a backward-looking  anachronistic vision of history - cannot stop or delay its implementation.The situation in Namibia is not the only source of tension in southern Africa. Apartheid  which has become a crime against humanity  is also a considerable source of tension. That is why  now more than ever before  and taking into account current political developments - the results of the sustained action of forces for change within South Africa and of external pressure - Gabon demands that the state of emergency be ended and that all political prisoners  including in particular Nelson Mandela  be released. furthermore  we ask those who stillsupport that regime to face the facts and to help in the total eradication of that shameful system.I could not conclude my statement on the political situation in Africa without referring to the burning question of the Comorian island of Mayotte. Gabon reaffirms its solidarity with the fraternal people of Comoros and reiterates its determination to continue its efforts to have the Comorian island of Mayotte returned to its homeland. I come now to international economic issues  which various parties have met to discuss. Among other issues  I want to mention the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund  which met in Washington on 31 March 1989 and at which Gabon presided  and the last summit of the seven most industrialized countries held quite recently in Paris.If we have seen a slight improvement in 1988 and 1989  as compared with previous years  we are bound to note that the developing countries have not really benefited from it. The trend of negative net transfers from our countries to the industrialized world and the international financial institutions  the deterioration in the terms of trade  the increase in international interest rates and a reduction in the gross domestic product of our various countries are the best illustration of this.As regards the delicate problem of debt  which in 1988  according to the estimates of the World Bank  had reached the outrageous sum of 31 245 billion for all the developing countries taken together  including 3230 billion for African countries alone  it is well known that the current cost of servicing this  by absorbing a growing proportion of export and budgetary income  is undermining adjustment efforts and is a major obstacle to the development prospects of our countries. I . spite of the rescheduling agreed to by creditors  our countries have not yet been able to achieve an overall improvement in the financial balance.The African countries in particular  with the assistance of international financial institutions  have even set up programmes of structural adjustment in order to cope with their serious indebtedness. The Gabonese Government  for its part  has  since 1986  established an adjustment programme with the objective  on one hand  of remedying the medium-term imbalances  both internal and external  and  on the other hand  of reducing the vulnerability of our countries to fluctuations in the price of oil.We must admit that these efforts have not yielded all the desired results. Therefore  taking into account the reasons for these distortions  the African countries have advocated  within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  collective steps with a view to tailoring structural adjustment programmes to the specific characteristics of the countries concerned. This approach is in accordance with the general guidelines suggested in the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes for Socio-economic Recovery and Transformation (AAF-SAP)   submitted last July at the fiftieth session of the Council of Ministers of the OAU  which adopted it  and by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa. Gabon requests that the General Assembly  in turn  adopt the AAF-SAP and hopes that the Development Committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  as well as the Group of 24  will do likewise.Furthermore  my country notes with interest the American initiative - the so-called Brady Plan - and the announcement  by President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand in Dakar  of the intention to write off the public debt of 35 African countries. Even though Gabon aid other medium-income countries have not benefited from this last measure  these are initiatives that we hope will lead to additional resources  and they are a real cause for satisfaction. In any case  they demonstrate the emergence of solidarity between North and South. Gabon  for its part  hopes thatprovisions to reduce the volume of trade debt and alleviate the cost of servicing it will be adopted. In this spirit  my country urges the creditor community to be impartial by establishing greater equity in the treatment of debt.I should like to take this opportunity to salute the Canadian Government for its recent initiative in writing off the debt of medium-income African countries. By and large  the economies of the developing countries will not show real growth so long as the prices of raw materials are not at a level that takes into account the movement in those of manufactured goods and the sluggishness of international markets.The international detente which we all agree should be emphasized and the development efforts agreed on for my country are aimed at achieving a better life for mankind in a sound environment.As regards the environment  the perils of the modern world - such as industrial pollution of the air  the warming trend in the planet  the greenhouse effect  the depletion of the ozone layer  and the dumping and storing of waste of all types  to name only a few - call for world-wide attention.In the face of what might seem to be a brake on progress  my country has adopted measures that should alleviate the repercussions on its people. I am thinking particularly of the establishment  in the Ministry of the Environment and the Protection of Nature  of a national anti-pollution centre and the establishment of a policy on the recycling and treatment of waste produced by our country and programmes to improve and preserve living resources through the reforestation of specific areas. It is in this spirit that  in international terms  my country welcomes the recent decision of the World Bank to include the idea of protection of the environment in the development projects that it finances. We also support the convening  in 1992  of a United Nations conference on the environment and development  described as a development which will help to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their needs.Over and above the fears caused by degradation or deterioration of the environment scourges such as the problem of drugs are no less serious in undermining our societies. Although confined  so far  to certain regions  the spectre of this calamity haunts the rest of the world. That situation led my country to convene  in June 1989 its first national seminar on the drug problem  and the recommendations to be adopted will include the setting up of an inter-ministerial committee to combat drugs  the development of a toxicology laboratory in Libreville for regional use  and the introduction of legislation on the use of  and trafficking in  narcotic drugs  adapted to the requirements of the penal code and the public-health code.These recommendations  which are similar to those enunciated by the President of the United States  and to those contained in the Secretary-General's plan  will we hope  help to stamp out this scourge of our times. Among all the ills that afflict our world today  AIDS is the most mind-boggling. Its lightening-like progression  as well as the devastation it wreaks  are staggering.Our countries  whose health infrastructures still have to be improved upon  are particularly concerned over this threat and we are following with the greatest of interest the efforts made by researchers the world over to find a cure. Gabon  thanks to its facilities for advanced medical research at the international centre in Franceville  recently organized a symposium on AIDS. We are firmly determined to continue  through this machinery  to make our contribution to the campaign against this terrible illness  and hope to see an intensification and diversification of exchanges with similar facilities in the rest of the world.The developing countries  committed as we are  along with international financial institutions  to programmes of structural adjustment  cannot overlook the effects of those programmes on the poorest strata of our society  especially the risk of social upheaval  which is bound to threaten international peace and detente.Thus  after the Bamako Initiative  the proposals made by the United Nations Children's Fund for ""adjustment with a human face"" - the only way our countries can hope to begin developing - were welcomed by us.While efforts made in recent years for international detente are worthy of praise  it seems nevertheless necessary to call the attention of our Assembly to the fact that its gradual establishment has not yet led to significant changes in international relations.Our times demand that detente not be thought of as immobility  or as a breathing spell for the great Powers  lb the contrary  by its underlying dynamism detente should serve the cause of world peace.Our common destiny requires that we work towards this together in order to achieve one of the major objectives of our Organization  to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war"".More than ever it is time to act with determination in order to achieve this end. Our Organization has so many commitments to meet  that only this prospect will allow for the achievement of the ideal of peace  which is the basis of all of Gabon's policies.Peace  justice and harmony in Africa and in the rest of the world: that is the message that my country wished  through me  from this lofty rostrum  to address to this Assembly."
"53",2531,"GBR",44,1989,"ï»¿Let me first  if I my  sir  add my congratulations to those you have already received on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. The first country .that I ever lived and worked in outside my own was Nigeria - in Jos  your home town - and I have a very great affection for the country and for its citizens. I wish you the greatest possible success in your presidency. I wish also to thank the outgoing President  Mr. Dante Caputo  and to pay a tribute to the tireless work of the Secretary-General throughout the past year.Fifty years ago this month  war began in Europe and spread throughout the world. Fifty-five million people died. The landscape of international relations was profoundly changed. That war inspired the creation of this Organization. The United Nations  conceived out of war  was the best framework our predecessors could devise for law  for order  and for peace. Hopes for it then were high  but they did not last. Even as the General Assembly was meeting for the first time  in London  divisions were opening between the two halves of Europe. The peoples of the East  for whom my country went to war  found that victory had been secured at an appalling price. They had won the peace  but they had lost their freedom. That division of Europe and that loss of freedom imposed a polarity on world affairs which has bedevilled international politics for over 40 years. Today  I am struck by the enormous and cheering contrast with those times. I believe that the feeling of hope and opportunity in world affairs is greater today than at any time since the Assembly first met  in London  my home town. The hopes of the early days have been revived. Ideologies have become less Potent: it is less and less relevant to talk of Easiest  or North-South  or the first  second  third or even fourth worlds. Instead  we should talk of a world whose nation States have reciprocal rights  responsibilities and obligations. There is only one world. We all share in it and must make of it what we can. Today  the opportunities for the United Nations to make good use of that fine framework for law  order and peace I spoke of have suddenly become real. There are new problems that we must face together. We have moved from cold war to global warming. Fresh ideas and attitudes are changing the face of the Soviet Union andEastern Europe. I agree with Mr. Shevardnadze that it is in the interests of all of us for perestroika to succeed.Liberty is reasserting itself in Poland and in Hungary and is drawing thousands of Germans from East to West. The cold war is ending where it started. Even the Berlin Wall cannot stem the exodus of people seeking a new life in freedom. No one doubts  I think  that we are only at the beginning of a long and difficult process. Patience and goodwill are necessary on a11 sides. Yesterday  Mr. Shevardnadze offered an authoritative Soviet view of recent events in Poland. I warmly welcome his remarks. I hope and believe that in making them he was burying  once and for all  the so-called Brezhnev doctrine  which was used to justify the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. with freedom no longer seen as a threat  there is a real opportunity to build a new Europe.The first priority for East-West relations must be to support and encourage the process of reform which is now under way. That will reinforce trust and confidence. A co-ordinated approach  including very substantial economic support  is essential. The European Community has made clear its readiness to play its full part  with both short- and long-term measures. Both will be needed. The challenge is to work in partnership with others to bring about a Community of Europe  to stand alongside the Community in Europe. The goal is a Europe of peace  prosperity and freedom  where the terms East and west have more to do with geography than with politics - a Europe without enforced divisions  whose people are at liberty to determine their own future.Increasing trust will assist the process of arms control. Success in this field is a priority. For the past 40 years the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has resolutely maintained the peace in Europe. Now it is taking new opportunities to consolidate that peace. NATO countries have tabled far-reaching conventional arms proposals. Their aim is clears it is enhanced security at equal and lower levels of forces in Europe. More peace at less cost is an attractive bargain for everyone.We are encouraged by the steps agreed upon between the United States and the Soviet Union to achieve faster progress towards an early START agreement. The proposed 50 per cent cuts in their nuclear arsenals will make a major contribution to international security and stability.We are working also for the achievement of a global chemical weapons ban. I warmly welcome the proposals made by President Bush on Monday and the positive Soviet response to them. The reduction of United States and Soviet stockpiles ahead of a convention will do much to reassure countries that do not possess chemical weapons and will also remove the rationale for other countries to cling to their stocks. It is through practical steps like these that Governments can best show their determination to get rid of these gruesome weapons. My country gave up its chemical weapons 30 years ago. We look forward to other countries destroying theirs.We should look also for a way to give more impetus and focus to the Geneva negotiations on chemical weapons. Today I propose one way to do this: let us move from the present intermittent pattern of negotiations to round-the-year meetings  as already happens in other areas of arms control. We can also be encouraged by the progress that has been made towards the resolution of regional conflicts in different parts of the world. In Namibia the international community  and the united Nations in particular  has shown what co-operation can achieve. Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is more than a decade old  but its principles have remained valid. That in turn has opened the way to Namibian independence.The Namibian independence process is the direct responsibility of the United Nations and the Secretary-General personally  since we met last year  there has been major progress towards implementation of the United Nations plan. Now  as Namibia's elections draw near  it is vital for all of us to give our full support to the Secretary-General and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). All the parties involved must show restraint  particularly in the face of provocation  such as the recent murder of Anton Lubowski. Violence and intimidation will serve only those who wish to deny Namibia its freedom.But Namibia will need help after independence as well. Britain will Play a full part in that effort. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting next month we shall also be considering what help the Commonwealth can provide. Next year  I hope  a free  independent Namibia will have taken its place in the Assembly and also  I trust  as a welcome new member of the Commonwealth. Fighting still continues in Angola and in Mozambique  but there is now some movement towards peace in both of those countries. I urge both sides in Angola to restore the cease-fire and to resume negotiations on the basis of the common ground identified in June. For our part  we shall continue to give full support to President Chissano's efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement with Renamo. We call upon the new South African Government to support those efforts in the letter and spirit of the Nkomati accord. That means making sure that no support - no support - goes from South Africa to Renamo.South Africa remains the key to lasting stability in that region. In the recent elections  70 per cent of the white-minority electorate voted for change. One hundred per cent of the black population  denied a vote  are calling urgently for change. Mr. de Klerk campaigned from a platform of reform. He committed himself to work for a new South Africa  in which all the people would be fully represented. He made a clear declaration of intent. There is now a clear mandate. Now the declaration and the mandate must be turned into action.Of one thing I am sure. Apartheid cannot survive and it does not deserve to survive. It is not something to be tolerated or to be patient with  it is something to oppose constantly and comprehensively. Violence is not the answer. Nor are economic sanctions. They weigh the possibility of change against the certainty of immediate  lasting hardship to the black community whose growing economic muscle is already contributing to the erosion of apartheid.No. The answer to apartheid is unremitting political pressure on South Africa to reform itself  wise policy lies in assistance and support for the innocent victims of apartheid within South Africa - political prisoners and township dwellers alike. It lies also in support for the economies of South Africa's neighbours and help for them to defend themselves against attempts at destabilization. Positive action  constructive action - action in which Britain's record is second to none and will remain so. Many brave men and women in South Africa have struggled peacefully and Persistently against apartheid. If I single out Helen Suzman  it is because  for 40 years  often alone in the South African Parliament  often in the face of threats and intimidation  she fought for freedom. She is in London today. I am pleased to tell the Assembly that she will be honoured by Her Majesty the Queen with one of our highest awards for all she has done in the campaign for justice. In her name  Britain will be funding a new scholarship scheme  soon bringing to 1 000 the number of our annual scholarships for black South Africans.  The new Government in South Africa must now move quickly and unambiguously to meet its commitment to fundamental reform. A new and just society cannot be constructed overnight. But we are clear what should happen. We want to see the release of detainees  the lifting of the state of emergency  the suspension of violence and a dialogue with black leaders to consider and to implement the changes that must be made.  I hope that the United Nations will be ready to respond appropriately to clear and practical signs of change. But signs there must be. That should be our common message to South Africa's leaders.Since we last met  my country and Argentina have taken significant steps towards achieving a more normal relationship  in doing so  the two countries have agreed to set the question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands on one side. Following preliminary talks here in August  both sides will be meeting again in Madrid this month. For our part  we shall work hard to ensure the success of the process which has now begun. It will not be easy. And our ambitions should not be set too high too soon. But we enter these negotiations hoping for agreement. In the Middle East  the resolutions which are the core of the search for peace are now nearly a generation bid. Another generation of refugees and dispossessed people has new been added to what is first and foremost a human tragedy.Last year's renunciation of terrorism by the PLO and its willingness to recognize Israel were a major breakthrough. I hope that Israel will come to recognize that. The Israeli Government's proposal for elections in the occupied territories is a positive step too. I hope the PLO will come to recognize that. I pay tribute to the efforts of President Mubarak in taking these ideas forward. Elections must be part of a process leading to final status negotiations on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We believe that the best framework for these negotiations is an international conference under United Nations auspices.In Lebanon  we have witnessed for years a process of national self-destruction. Now it seems there is a glimmer of hope. We have welcomed and supported the efforts of the Arab League Committee of Three. They offer a bridge to peace. We hope all concerned in Lebanon's conflict will cross it. A particular threat hangs over the hostages in Lebanon. They are the victims of a detestable form of blackmail which threatens the entire international community.It is hard to appreciate the anguish of those held hostage  although I have seen the suffering of some of their families  and seen  too  their courage and determination  which is remarkable. John McCarthy  Terry Waite  and now Jackie Mann  three British hostages  have been held for a total of more than 2 000 days. We must keep them and the other hostages constantly in the public eye. They most not be forgotten or overlooked. We must make every effort to press for their unconditional release. There are countries with influence on the hostage-takers. They should use that influence without delay to secure the hostages  safe release  state terrorism is no more acceptable through agents than carried out directly.  It is time to return the hostages to their families  and that should be the message from this Assembly.  Upon one further Point we must all be clear. We must and we dare not give in to the blackmail of terrorists. The Security Councils resolution on terrorism last July added the authority of this Organisation to that message. We need to work for the wide adoption of specific counter-measures. After horrific bombing of Pan Am night 103  the United Kingdom  with Czechoslovakia. is seeking an international agreement on the marking of explosives. All of us are naturally concerned at inflict or tension between countries  or within countries. A number of instates were raised on behalf of European Community countries by my colleague  Roland Dumas. yesterday. I would single out only one  Burma  where  here is an urgent need for the restoration of human rights and democracy through free elections. Earlier this year millions of us around the world were shocked to see Chinese troops kill and wound their fellow citizens on the orders of their own Government. The measures that we have taken in response to those events are not. however  intended to isolate China. We hope to see China return to genuine reform and to repair the damage done to its international relations. No Government can survive indefinitely by the suppression of peaceful dissent. By treaty. Hong Kong will revert to China in 1997. By treaty  Hong Kong will also preserve its traditional freedoms and way of life. That treaty  the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984  is binding. It has been registered as such at the United Nations by both Britain and China.I welcome unreservedly China's reaffirmation of its commitment to the Joint Declaration. Britain is likewise committed  bindingly and whole-heartedly. But our common commitment must now be reflected in action. And practical reassurances are required from China to the people of Hong Kong  so that they may feel secure in their future  both up to 1997 and beyond. Hong Kong is resilient. Its economy continues to thrive. But it will take time  steady nerves and  above all  an explicitly supportive attitude on the part of China to restore Hong Kong's confidence in its future.For our part  Britain will continue vigorously to represent the interests of Hong Kong's people in our discussions with China  we intend also to introduce concrete measures to reassure people in the territory about their future. They include-  the early introduction of a Bill of Rights; the development of more representative government; and a package to encourage people essential to Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity to stay there  by giving them guarantees of resettlement in Britain if they wish. That package will be designed not to strip Hong Kong of its people  but to give them hope and confidence to remain in Hong Kong. 	Hong Kong's continued confidence and success is in the interest of the entire international community. In return  Hong Kong needs international understanding and support. That was recognized by the Paris economic summit  and I hope it will also be recognized by this Assembly. International understanding and support is also required in response to the intractable problem of the Vietnamese boat people.The continuing human exodus from Viet Nam has imposed an insuperable burden on Places of first asylum in the region. Hong Kong alone has more than 56 000 boat people in its camps-  over 32 000 of them have arrived this year.Yet the bleak reality is that for most of these people there are no homes to go to outside their own country. They are not political refugees. Under the criteria laid down by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  they have left Viet Nam for economic reasons  and not under political pressure.  In June  at Geneva  the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees agreed that: ""Persons determined not to be refugees should return to their country of origin in accordance with international practices reflecting the responsibility of States towards their own citizens."" That is surely the only answer. Alas  there is no room for them in Hong Kong. There is no hope of a home in any new country. The existing situation is  therefore  unsustainable.The international community knows that it cannot simply leave this problem with Hong Kong in the hope that somehow they will cope. They cannot cope. The Government and the people of Hong Kong have done all they can. They have put up 15 camps. They have provided food  clothing  schooling. But the limit of their capacity to help has been reached.For those boat people who are genuine refugees  homes are being found in countries around the world. That is as it should be. But for those boat people who are not refugees  there can ultimately be only one home: the one they came from  so far  only a few of them have recognized this and volunteered to return. We look to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to step up counselling of the non-refugees to ensure that more of them know that there is no future for them outside their own country.In mid-October  the international community will review developments since the Geneva Conference. The main purpose must be to agree a programme of repatriation under the good offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That must involve the phased  orderly and monitored return and re-integration in safety and dignity of all those who are not genuine refugees. To achieve that  Viet Nam must assume full responsibility for its own people and co-operate in the programme. We shall work in good faith with the Vietnamese authorities to that end.The world that many of us grew up in was haunted by memories of war and overshadowed by the threat of nuclear destruction. Yet  for many of us  it was a much more innocent world than today. Our parents did not live in fear that their children could be exposed to the lethal menace of drugs. We as parents today can have no such peace of mind.That is why the town of Medellin is now a household name throughout the world. That is why Colombia's battle against drugs is a battle on behalf of us all. The power of the traffickers transcends national boundaries. It demands an international response. I can announce today that  following discussions with the Colombian authorities  my Government has approved a substantial package of assistance for Colombia. It draws on our experience in fighting terrorism. It will comprise communications and towards equipment  technical assistance  and training for those in Colombia involved in the anti-drugs campaign. However  it is vital to make intensified efforts to reduce demand in consumer countries - to put the traders in human misery out of business. Britain will be hosting  in close co-operation with the United Nations  a major international conference in London next April to tackle the problems of demand reduction and cocaine.The United Nations already makes a significant contribution to international efforts to combat the drugs menace. But we must all do more. All states should ratify the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Britain will do so and has also signed nine agreements so far with other countries permitting the tracing and confiscation of the assets of drug traffickers. The world in which many of us grew up was also a more ignorant world. Pew then appreciated the fragility of the environment which sustains life. But today  if ever there was an issue that should unite the nations  it is this one. To meet this global challenge we need stronger international institutions and clearer priorities. That is why Britain has more than doubled its voluntary financial contribution to the United Nations Environment Programme. That is why Britain called in May for the early negotiation of an international convention on climate change. And that is why Britain is active in helping to protect tropical forests  whose importance in terms of both climate and resources is now far better understood. The priorities of preservation must live alongside the priorities of development and economic growth. A balance has to be struck. Our philosophy has to be sustainable development  development that benefits mankind and protects his environment. Partnership is a new watchword for the relationship between developed and developing countries. The priorities for that partnership are clear. In the first instance it must be for developing countries themselves to pursue sound economic policies. But development aid has an important part to play. So does action by creditor countries to relieve the debt burden on countries pursuing reform  and most especially on the poorest. International trade must be kept open and inflation contained to assist growth. Britain will continue to work for progress in all those areas.Experience has shown us that focusing tightly and in turn on the key issues is a better approach than looking for generalized global solutions. The international community  with the United Nations as its chosen instrument  faces a formidable range of challenges. But they are matched by opportunities. The demands on the United Nations are growing. But so is its prestige. So is its authority. So too is the extent of its engagement in new areas.As we recall the conflict which created the United Nations  it is reassuring to find the Organization developing its role so successfully today. With the membership's continued support the process can be taken further still. All of us will gain from that. For  as the then British Prime Minister told the very first session of the General Assembly:  ""The United Nations is really a coming together of all peoples in all countries and continents. It is not 'them' - it is; every one of us seeking  as citizens of the world  peace and security for humanity."" Now  at last  we cure doing just that."
"54",2602,"GHA",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to offer you  on behalf of the Ghana delegation  our warm congratulations on your unanimous election. Your election is a reflection not only of the international recognition of the valuable contribution which your country  Nigeria  has made and continues to make towards the promotion of global peace and security  but is also a tribute to the part which you personally have played in fashioning stable and credible international relations. We look forward to working with you in the tradition of our two countries. I should also like to congratulate your immediate predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  for his excellent leadership during the forty-third session of the General Assembly.Since our last meeting the international political climate has improved but not so the economic situation in most developing countries  which continues to be among the major preoccupations of countries such as mine. In sub-Saharan Africa  in particular  the situation remains critical in spite of the reform policies being implemented by African Governments and tine initiatives being taken by the international community to support African recovery efforts. Urgent measures are required to control the crisis and put Africa an the road to sustainable growth.The Ghana delegation would like to take this opportunity to express sincere appreciation for the financial end other support extended by the international community to Africa since the last session of the General Assembly.The fact remains  however  that sub-Saharan Africa will continue to require the maximum support and co-operation of the international community  particularly in dealing with the problems of external constraints  which  as confirmed by the Secretary-General in his report on the mid-term review  are ""emerging as the most critical obstacle to African recovery and development"". These relate to depressed export earnings  the severe debt-servicing burden and insufficient availability of finance.These obstacles have contributed in no small measure to the weak economic performance of the region  even as global output and trade in 1988 recorded significant growth and expansion. In that year  world trade grew at the remarkable rate of 8.3 per cent and the prices of non-fuel commodities improved substantially. However  the benefits of this strong growth in world trade and output were not evenly shared. Except for metals and sugar  the prices of commodities of interest to Africa either fell or remained weak. Ghana  for instance  lest about 3100 million in 1988 on its earnings from cocoa. With the international cocoa price falling further below last year's levels  the estimates of our losses this year are even higher.We believe that the way to bring stability to commodity markets and ensure remunerative prices fair to producer and consumer alike is to make effective use of the mechanisms provided by the Integrated Programme for Commodities. One such mechanism is the Common Fund for Commodities. My delegation  therefore  welcomes the coming into force of the Agreement on the Common Find for Commodities earlier this year. We should all work actively and constructively to make the Common Fund a worthy example of international co-operation for development.The large fiscal and trade imbalances of some of the major economies have created considerable strains in the trading system. Protectionist pressures have been mounting  as have unilateral actions. Access of developing countries' exports to markets in the industrialized countries has become increasingly difficult. The Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations must lead  among other things  to the removal of both tariff and non-tariff barriers  so as to restore free trade to its proper place in the international trading regime.Seven years ago  the common that had long been growing over the external indebtedness of developing countries erupted into a crisis. Rally aware of its potential for systemic disruption  the international community embarked on an uncertain search for solutions to the problem. Today  we are nowhere near a solution. The crisis has rather deepened. Debt service ratios have on the whole worsened and the magnitude of the debt has increased from a few billion dollars to 31.3 trillion. One can with good reason conclude that the strategies pursued so far have not been effective. The rescheduling of unmet obligations or the provision of funds to pay accrued interests  which have been the hallmark of debt management strategies  have only postponed current obligations and made debt-servicing burdens over the years even more onerous. Characteristic of the two-little-too-late approach to the solution of the debt problem is the rescheduling options for the Paris Club creditors agreed upon at the Toronto summit in June 1988. The Toronto consensus was heralded as holding promise for significant debt relief for the poorest developing countries on the basis of comparable burden-sharing by all official bilateral creditors. Since then the Paris Club has given further definition of the new options  end it is clear that the short-term cash flow benefits are unlikely to have a significant impact on the debt-servicing burdens of the countries concerned.When the multilateral financial institutions which were created to assist countries in meeting their short aid long-term resource needs become net recipients of resources even from debt distressed developing countries in a region like Africa  it is a clear failure of international policy. The various facilities aid programmes established for the purpose of enhancing the lending capacities of the Bretton Woods institutions  such as the World Bank's special programme of assistance to support concessionary co-financing and the Fund's structural adjustment and enhanced structural adjustment facilities  have not been adequate to stem the tide of reverse transfer of resources to these institutions  particularly the Fund. Furthermore  the commendable effort being made by some debtor countries  in spite of severe resource constraints  to meet their debt and other obligations has resulted in the untenable phenomenon  in recent years  of the net transfer of huge resources from developing to developed countries.This is indeed troubling because other sources of capital flours have levelled off. Reduction in private lending has been drastic while official development assistance has stagnated at more or less half of the target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product established by the United Nations. I must here pay a deserved tribute to those developed countries that have attained or even exceeded this target.Faced with these constraints  most developing countries carrying out structural adjustment programmes have not been able to register growth in their economies. Investment to enable them to expand their productive base and create jobs and wealth has had to be drastically curtailed. Equally affected is investment in social infrastructure  such as health and education.In Africa  the economic and social situation is a matter of deep concern. Per capita output has been negative for several consecutive years. Average living standards have been falling end large sections of the population are unable to meet their basic needs. It is a region that  according to the estimates of the Economic Commission for Africa  suffered terms of trade losses in 1987 of the order of $19 billion  transferred over 91 billion net to the International Monetary Find (IMF) and repaid several billion dollars to creditors. It also faces a resource gap variously estimated by the World Bank  the IMF and the Secretary-General's Advisory Group on Resource Flows to Africa to be between 31 5 billion and 3 5 billion per annum.At a time when many developing countries have been carrying out structural adjustment and policy reforms  it is difficult to understand why their determined efforts should be so needlessly undercut by an inadequate response of the developed countries. It is even more incomprehensible that the industrialized countries stubbornly refuse to engage in such dialogue as would ensure justice for the developing countries. The alternative to dialogue is confrontation. The economic and social hardship imposed on developing countries through a conscious policy of maintaining economic inequalities emanating from colonialism is a potent threat to international peace and security  to the sustainability of the adjustment programmes and indeed of debt-servicing obligations  with dire implications for the international financial system as a whole.Clearly the growing economic marginalization of important regions in an interdependent world cannot be allowed to continue. That was why the Group of 77 called for the holding of a special session of the General Assembly to examine ways and means of reactivating growth  particularly in the developing countries. The session  to be held early next year  should reach a consensus on policy measures to be adopted to ensure the economic recovery and development of the developing countries. The outcome of the special session will no doubt provide useful inputs for the elaboration of the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade. We should make the 1990s a decade of hope  of recovery from economic and social decline  of equitable international economic relations  and a decade in which development will regain its lost momentum.No country can today remain aloof from the concern expressed world-wide over environmental degradation and the daily damage to our climate conditions whose harmful effects know no boundaries. The Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77 held in Caracas this year recognized the importance of this issue and emphasized the close relationship between poverty aid environmental degradation. Ghana therefore supports the proposed conference on the environment to be held in 1992.We wish to stress that the developed countries bear greater responsibility not only because they are largely responsible for the degradation of the environment aid pollution of the atmosphere but also because they have the resources and technical know-hew for reversing the situation while promoting sustainable development. They also have responsibility to stop the unconscionable conduct on the part of their industrialists of dumping hazardous wastes in developing countries. We should also like to see an international convention with appropriate penalties for the dumping of toxic waste. In this connection  it is a matter of deep regret that the Basel Convention of 22 March 1989 on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and Their Disposal has not met the concerns of all. It does not provide for stopping waste traffic from the industrialized world to developing countries desperate for hard currency.We would also like to caution against the concern for the environment on the part of the developed countries being translated into environmental conditionalities for development assistance. That concern should be channelled into research for new and environmentally more secure technologies that should be freely available to all.Improved East-West relations continue to strengthen prospects for further advances in arms control and disarmament. This is particularly true of the ongoing East-West talks in Vienna on cutting down conventional weapons and thereby reducing the risk of war in Europe. While the negotiations are fraught with complexities the opening bargaining positions have been close enough to give hope that a conventional arms treaty in Europe could be a reality. The lesson of the Vienna talks should not be lost on developing countries  which should not indulge in unrestricted purchase of such weapons. In this regard much will depend on the extent to which East-West detente aid non-interference in the internal affairs of developing countries makes this unnecessary.We welcome President Bush's proposals on the banning of chemical weapons and the encouraging response by the Soviet Foreign Minister  Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze. Ghana shares the international concern about the use end spread of chemical weapons. This concern underlies our signing of the 1925 Geneva Protocol  which outlaws such weapons  aid our support for the declaration adapted at the aid of the Paris Conference held early this year. We hope that the statements by the Soviet Union and the United States will help speed up the Geneva negotiations on a chemical-weapons convention.With regard to nuclear disarmament  Ghana is concerned about the slow rate of progress so far registered. Despite current positive developments in the field of disarmament  the world is still threatened by the massive stock of nuclear arsenals. We call upon the super-Powers aid other nuclear-weapon States to redeem their promises of effectively eliminating nuclear weapons from our planet.The global drive for peace continues to show encouraging results in several regions. Conflict and confrontation seem to be giving way to political dialogue and negotiation  aid even if the guns are not entirely silent the over whelming desire is for conciliation and mutual accommodation.It is a matter of deep regret that the united Nations  which has been a major contributor to this encouraging trend  should continue to be starved of funds  particularly as the reforms recommended in 1985 by the high-level governmental experts have been implemented almost in full.To the critics of the united Nations we say that the problem does not lie with the Organization. The problem may well lie with their perceptions of the Organization  which fortunately are not shared by the majority of Member States. We wish to reiterate our appeal to those member States still withholding their contributions to release them so as to make the Organization solvent. We also takethis opportunity to support  in principle  the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of a special reserve fund for peace-keeping operations.Ghana had hoped that the month-long Paris Conference on Kampuchea  which ended in failure five weeks ago  would build upon the very useful groundwork done in Indonesia earlier in fee year. We are happy to note  however  that it will reconvene in the spring of 1990. We urge all the parties to exercise maximum flexibility in order to resolve their outstanding differences..On the Middle East  Ghana continues to support the call for an international peace conference under the auspices of the united Nations  to be attended by all parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  to deal with the problems of Palestinian rights aid secure boundaries for all States in the region. The recently announced  hard-line conditions for carrying out the election proposals made by Israel have not improved the prospects for peace in that troubled land. The conditions - which are that no elections will be held until the intifadah ends  that Arabs in East Jerusalem will not be permitted to take part  that Jewish settlements will continue to be built  and that Israel will not agree to give up any land - are not designed to promote peace. So far  the PLO and its Arab friends have been making all the running for peace. We call upon Israel to reciprocate these peace gestures.The current peace efforts in the Afghanistan situation urgently need to be strengthened. Eighteen months after the signing of the Geneva Agreements and seven months after the Soviet troop pull-out  Afghanistan continues to suffer from gross and unwarranted external interference. The Assembly should call for the immediate cessation of external interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan so that the Afghan peoples can together reconstruct their corn try.The peace process in the Iran-Iraq situation also requires a new impetus. He welcome the several rounds of talks under the auspices of the United Nations  including the proposals for confidence-building measures between the two parties. For the peace efforts to succeed  however  Iran and Iraq would have to show the necessary flexibility and move away from the present impasse by narrowing their positions on the constituent elements of the cease-fire  including  in particular  the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized boundaries and the early return to navigation of the Shatt a 1-Arab waterway. We also call upon the two parties to allow the prisoner-of-war exchange to proceed as required by article 118 of the 1949 Geneva Convention.Since the last session of the General Assembly significant developments have been taking place in Central America  raising the prospect of peace in that region. It is our firm conviction that the Esquipulas- II Agreements remain the most viable basis for bringing peace to the region. We therefore support the efforts of the five leaders of Central America and urge all parties to exercise the necessary political will aid restraint  which alone can give the peace arrangements the chance to work.The current wave of international peace has also washed the African shore. The peace treaty signed on Thursday  31 August  between Libya aid Chad  ending their 16-year-old conflict  reflects the happy turn of events an the continent. We welcome the peace efforts in Angola and Mozambique. We continue to watch with much in sorest the ongoing consultations on the planned referendum on Western Sahara  whose people cannot be denied their legitimate aspirations indefinitely.The situation in southern Africa  however  continues to be a matter of deep concern. The brutal repression send harassment of the members of the mass democratic movement protesting against the sham all-white elections held on 6 September should make all those who see the end of apartheid in South Africa's cost to peace overtures sit back aid think again. The racist regime has not  despite its recent declarations and overtures  shown any willingness to move in the direction of real justice for the black majority. The racist regime continues to fund and direct the Mozambique National Resistance (MNR) to ravage Mozambican peasants and workers. It also continues to provide weapons to the UNITA bandits to undermine the efforts for peace in Angola. It has through trickery and treachery sought to rig the Namibian elections  in flagrant disregard of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). The verdict of the Security Council contained in its unanimous resolution 640 (1989)  adapted in August  has clearly exposed the contradiction between what South Africa preaches and what it actually does. There is a need  therefore  for the international community to remain vigilant aid maintain its pressure on the racist regime.Our oft-stated position  in the light of the worsening situation  is that South Africa must lift the state of emergency immediately and unconditionally  release Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and detainees  lift the ban on all political organizations and opponents of apartheid  commence meaningful negotiations with genuine black leaders on ending apartheid  halt the carnage in Mozambique and Angola caused by its surrogate organization  and cease military aggression against its neighbours in order to end apartheid and bring peace and security to the area. Until that is done  comprehensive mandatory sanctions should be imposed on the racist regime by the international community.In conclusion  we must stress that the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries remains an urgent matter for solution by the international community. It calls for a realistic approach which fully reflects the spirit of interdependence and international co-operation which has emerged in dealing with political issues.Ghana welcomes the commendable efforts by the United Nations in the discharge of its role of promoting peace  social progress and better standards of life for peoples throughout the world. As we enter a new decade  this role will become even more important. The United Nations requires the co-operation of all Member States in the years ahead in dealing with its daunting tasks. The people and Government of Ghana stand ready to play their part."
"55",2648,"GIN",44,1989,"ï»¿It is a pleasure for roe once again to extend to the. Assembly the warm and friendly greetings of the Republic of Guinea and of its President  General Lansana Conte.Your election  Sir  to preside over the current session augurs well for success in our work  thanks to your great diplomatic experience and your outstanding personal qualities  which fit you very well for your high office. You are the representative of a continent constantly struggling for the advent of a new world order. Your country  Nigeria  is noted for its dynamic commitment to peace and progress. Moreover  we hardly need recall that Africa's economic charter  approved in April 1S80  bears the title of ""the Lagos Plan of Action"". I assure you of my delegation's full co-operation as you discharge your mandate.I also wish to pay a well deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  who presided ably and competently over the forty-third session. My delegation would also pay a tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for his courageous and tireless work for peace and for understanding between peoples.While welcoming the positive changes in international relations in recent years  we have to note that some political crises persist in the world. We are concerned about the situation in southern Africa  Palestine  the occupied Arab territories  Lebanon  Afghanistan and Cambodia.In southern Africa  in just under two months the future of Namibia will be decided when elections are held in the Territory. In that connection  my country condemns Pretoria's delaying tactics to hinder the proper implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). Because of those tactics  the Security Council must shoulder its responsibility for the full implementation of that resolution.Effective action must begin with the demobilization of the troops integrated into the South African police - in particular  the notorious Koevoet  set up to be veritable commandos of death and terror in Namibia.I repeat my country's unconditional support for the South West Africa People's Organization. We hope that the courageous people of Namibia will soon see the dawn of an era of regained freedom and true independence.In South Africa itself  the racist Pretoria regime's 12-month extension of the state of emergency is further proof of that regime's disregard for our Organization's resolutions and decisions. Neither the spectacular departure of Mr. Botha nor the fancy diplomatic footwork of his successor can hide the omnipresence of apartheid. There are still restrictions on the press  and arbitrary arrest of the regime's political opponents is the daily lot of the people of South Africa.The mockery of elections that exclude 75 per cent of the population exposes the stubborn  racist nature of an increasingly condemned system. Those elections are not only contrary to the legal norms of the United Nations  but flagrantly violate the right of the South African people freely to decide their own future on the basis of the principle of one person  one vote.Meanwhile  support for the African National Congress of South Africa  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and all those others that are fighting the anachronistic system of apartheid must become more real  and international action to increase awareness of the problem must be continued and intensified.The Government of Guinea endorses the recommendations of the latest Summit of the non-aligned countries  held in Belgrade from 4 to 8 September this year  which called on the international community to take concerted action to compel the apartheid regime to answer for its crimes against mankind.Pretoria is pushing its arrogance even further beyond the limits  by stepping up its acts of aggression and destabilization against the front-line and other neighbouring States. That State terrorism has led to disturbing population movements in the region  jeopardizing the economic and social balance. I therefore repeat the appeal made in the Oslo Declaration of August 1988 on humanitarian aid to States suffering so much from that scourge.Elsewhere on the continent we should support the commendable efforts of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity and all others of good will to establish conditions favourable to a climate of peace in Chad  Angola  Ethiopia  Sudan and Mozambique. My Government supports this peace process  which is based on dialogue  the search for agreement and mediation.We also have hopes of a final settlement of the question of Western Sahara  through the holding of the self-determination referendum.The talks now under way between France and the Comoros reflect the willingness of the two parties to reach a just solution to the question of the Comorion island of Mayotte.As for Lebanon  my Government appreciates the responsible role being played by the Tripartite Committee of the Arab Heads of State with the aim of putting an end to the unspeakable suffering of the people of Lebanon caused by the civil war.The question of Palestine is at the heart of the Middle East crisis. Therefore  any viable solution must involve the following factors: Israel's total withdrawal from all the occupied territories  including Jerusalem; the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people - particularly its right to a homeland; recognition of the State of Palestine and the peace initiative of President Yasser Arafat; and  finally  the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East  with the participation of all the parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  on an equal footing.Guinea welcomes the cease-fire in the conflict between Iran and Iraq  and urges the two parties  under the auspices of the United Nations  to move their positions beyond the current situation of no war  no peace  and to establish an atmosphere of good neighbourliness  in keeping with Security Council resolution 598 (1987).Despite the meagre results of the Paris Conference on Cambodia  consultations must continue with a view to establishing more favourable conditions for the resumption and eventual success of the work of that Conference. The dialogue that has begun between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union will certainly help to ease the situation.Despite the withdrawal of foreign troops  the fighting has become even more deadly in Afghanistan  so there is an urgent need fully to implement the letter and spirit of the Geneva Agreements  including providing increased food aid to the Afghan refugees and ensuring their repatriation and their speedier reintegration into society.With regard to New Caledonia  the Matignon Agreements  signed in Paris on 26 June 1988 by all the parties  marked an important stage towards the realization by the New Caledonian people of their aspirations.Only respect for territorial integrity and national unity can help bring about peace in Cyprus and the Korean peninsula. The Korean people is waging a legitimate struggle  worthy of our full support  for the peaceful reunification of its country  without outside interference.Similarly  we support the current negotiations between the Cypriot Government and the Turkish community  under the auspices or the Secretary-General.The situation in Central America is also a matter of serious concern. My Government welcomes the efforts of the Heads of State of the region  and of other Latin American countries  to achieve a final agreement  in keeping with the spirit of the Esquipulas II and Tela meetings.In opening this session on 19 September 1989  which was also the International Day of Peace - and peace is so very dear to mankind - the international community's intention was  in our view  to urge all those of good will to ensure that this year again we shall add one more stone to the fine house we are called upon to erect together. At no time in the past 40 years has peace been so near at hand than it is now. After having been threatened for so long by antagonistic ideologies  chauvinism and passion  peace is now looming on the horizon  not as the light at sunset but as the light of the sun rising inevitably towards the zenith.That is why the Government of Guinea is convinced of the following: disarmament is the business of all States; nuclear disarmament is still the priority  but conventional disarmament should also be accorded the importance it warrants; the creation and extension of nuclear-weapon-free zones strengthens security; chemical weapons must be eliminated; there is a symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development  since the resources freed by disarmament can be used for economic and social progress.While most speakers have shown a certain optimism with regard to the resolution of many political crises  the same cannot be said with regard to economic matters. The main feature of con temporary international relations is interdependence between political stability and economic progress. The North-South dialogue our countries have so much yearned for is still deadlocked. In the meantime  the gap between the rich countries and the other countries is widening  as is clearly shown by the persistence of the current world economic crisis.Arbitrary prices for commodities and for goods manufactured by the North completely negates measures that are being put forward to ease the foreign-debt-servicing burden. Trade is carried out in a discriminatory manner. Our countries still do not have access to modern science and technology. Financial flows to the South are becoming increasingly rare while paradoxically  the North is accentuating the factors responsible for the continued financial bleeding of the South. With regard to the question of debt  indebtedness continues to absorb the fruit of the efforts of the poor countries  in particular in Africa  where the income is falling significantly in spite of the harsh measures taken in structural adjustments. While some creditor countries have agreed to forgive official debt - for which my country expresses its sincere gratitude - it is nevertheless clear that the solution to the economic crisis rests mainly on promoting remunerative prices for commodities.It is fitting to emphasize that the critical economic and social situation in the countries of the South - aggravated in the case of some by a growing influx of refugees and displaced persons - is not conducive to ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights called for by the international community as a whole.The various United Nations development decades have not yielded significant results. Hence  it is essential to prepare the kind of international strategy that will allow us to see the light at the end of the tunnel. In this regard  the convening in September 1990 of the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and the holding in April 1990 of the special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation  as well as the implementation of a strategy within the context of the Fourth United Nations Development Decade  will provide added impetus to efforts for the establishment of a new international economic order. Environmental degradation is today a reality that can only be dealt with at a world-wide level. Deforestation  gaps in the ozone layer  pollution and natural disasters have all overwhelmed the ecosystem and endangered life.My delegation recognizes that the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme have already begun to study climatic change through the setting up of an intergovernmental working group. We also support the strengthening of the programme on climatology already in place. We believe that in so doing we will help avoid the fragmentation of research in this area at a time of international economic difficulties.On the question of toxic wastes  the cross-border transport and dumping of such wastes has negative effects on development and on the environment that call for a greater awareness and the speedy adoption of a world convention.With regard to human rights  let me point out that in my country we say that the human face of. poverty  despair and ignorance is often that of the woman  the innocent child  the old person living alone or the handicapped person without resources. Hence my Government clearly sees the right to development as a specific human right. That is why the Military Committee for National Recovery believes that eliminating material poverty  social inequality and ignorance is the sine qua non for promoting human rights. As far as the Republic of Guinea is concerned  freedom  whether it be individual or collective  either is or is not; it must be seen as a whole  as an essential benefit that cannot be either negotiated or forfeited. It is the most valuable resource God has given to man.Accordingly  the national authorities have advocated that international legal instruments on human rights be included in the domestic legal system of our country through the adoption of legislation.There is a phenomenon today that has assumed unmanageable proportions: I refer to the problem of drugs and psychotropic substances about which the alarm has sounded in many countries. There is no doubt that the use of such substances is injurious to health and corrupts the youth  which is the most vulnerable sector of the population and the hope and the future of human society.The struggle against this endemic evil necessarily involves international co-operation in stopping the production and consumption of drugs and their illicit trafficking. The example of the United States of America aid Colombia is one that could well be followed. It is the concrete expression of an active solidarity that is essential if we are to erect an impregnable barrier against this scourge.I new turn to terrorism. Whether it be by an individual or a group of individuals  or the deliberate policy of a State  terrorism is criminal  and the Guinean Government condemns it most vigorously. Because terrorism threatens or kills innocent persons aid undermines international security  there cannot be any moral justification for it. Furthermore  it cannot become a tool in the legitimate struggle waged by peoples for freedom and emancipation.The preservation of peace and the struggle for progress requires democratisation in international relations. Hence we must step up the role and influence of this world Organization while ensuring respect for and the promotion of the norms of international law. We must also take a fresh look at the challenges before us  in particular the economic challenge.It is encouraging to see that the United Nations is now reviewing its role and doing its utmost to discharge its historic mission. The world is changing quickly and the United Nations cannot stand aloof. Its effectiveness depends on how it can adapt to the realities of the twenty-first century - that is to say  its ability to conceive a strategy in keeping with a universality that is its essential character is tic.Today the trend on the part of us all is towards greater love for our fellow man  for the earth and for the heavens  and we must all resolutely look towards the future for the advent of a new world  young and beautiful  based on justice  freedom  prosperity and peace."
"56",2687,"GMB",44,1989,"ï»¿Let me first of all extend to Mr. Garba my warmest congratulations on his election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His unanimous election is a clear testimony of the high personal regardâ esteem and confidence which he enjoys in this Assembly given his vast experience as a seasoned diplomat  a fine soldier and a statesman  it is equally a recognition of the respect we all have for his great country and people. My country enjoys most cordial and very special relations with the sister Republic of Nigeria and we are indeed proud of the leading role his country has always played and continues to play in the cause of freedom  justice and peace. While wishing him all success in his presidency  I would like to assure him of my delegation's fullest support and co-operation throughout the session. I would also like to express our sincere thanks and gratitude to his Predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  for the efficient and successful manner in which he directed the work of the forty-third session of the General assembly. To the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  I salute his unswerving efforts and relentless pursuit of the promotion of world peace and international understanding.  The forty-fourth session is taking place at a momentous time in the history of international political relations  when the quest for collective security and peace has witnessed very positive developments  particularly in the prevailing atmosphere of detente between the two super-Powers. It is often said that in world diplomacy things move glacially; but the recent positive achievements in resolving regional conflicts are in themselves unprecedented. The commencement of the independence Process for Namibia  the cease-fire in the Gulf and the progress towards resolving the Kampuchean problem are achievements of which our Organization can rightly he proud  and it is the fervent hope of my delegation that this encouraging trend in seeking peaceful solutions to conflicts between nations will be further consolidated in the years ahead. The Gambia believes that in the United Nations we have the machinery for the peaceful settlement of differences among nations; the machinery for replacing mistrust with mutual confidence  for engendering understanding instead of suspicion  and above all the machinery that can institutionalise dialogue in place off confrontation as a means off settling disputes among nations.My delegation also believes that the achievements made so far in resolving regional conflicts will be negated so long as the threat of nuclear destruction continues to hang over our heads like the sword of Damocles. That is why we note with satisfaction that disarmament stays on the agenda as a high priority in world politics. The United Nations has an exceedingly important role to play in establishing a climate conducive to meaningful dialogue on this critical issue. The elimination of weapons of mass destruction and an end to the arms race will not only serve the cause of world peace and security  but will also release human and material resources that could be devoted to meaningful and beneficial social and economic programmes in developing countries. In this vein. President Bush's declaration before this Assembly that the United States is ready to destroy over 80 per cent of its existing chemical weapons stock even before the conclusion off the chemical weapons convention and the Soviet Union's positive response to this proposal is an unprecedented occurrence in super-Power relations that should be applauded by all Members of the United Nations.However  those of us in the developing world should admit that the end off the arms race by the super-Powers would be meaningless in terms off mobilizing more resources for national development if those countries themselves continue to spend colossal suns out of their national budgets on defence expenditures. The disproportionate amounts being spent on military expenditures by developing countries not only diverts valuable resources from national development but also puts into question our declared aim of peaceful resolution of disputes.It is regrettable that the notable achievements made in the resolution of regional conflicts or in creating a salutary atmosphere in international political relations generally are not reflected in the situation in southern Africa  where the racist minority require in Pretoria continues to pursue its odious policy of apartheid at home and its aggression against the front-line States  thereby causing havoc and untold suffering in the region. The pernicious and outrageous system of apartheid remains an unacceptable affront to the civilized world and should be met with a firm and uncompromising response on the part of the international community. Attempts at appeasing  persuading or pampering the racist Pretoria regime in order to make it change its policy can only fortify that regime in its defiance of world opinion. It is true that the wind of change blowing across South Africa has raised some optimism about the final demise of apartheid. But it must be admitted that without the courageous and determined stand of the freedom fighters of South Africa under the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) and other democratic and popular movements  coupled with the limited economic sanctions against the apartheid regime  there would not have been the trend towards change in that country. There is need  therefore  to maintain and intensify the pressure for the abolition of apartheid. The racist regime should not be left to proceed at its own pace. The peoples of South Africa  as has been demonstrated by the current campaign of defiance of segregationist laws and regulations  cannot wait indefinitely for the reform of a system that is unreformable and must be destroyed. Freedom is an inalienable right; it cannot be negotiated or dished out in small morsels over a period of time.The Gambia is firmly convinced that one of the most effective and peaceful ways of compelling Pretoria to enter into immediate and substantive negotiations with the authentic representatives of the majority population is the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime.The Gambia has been following with keen interest the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978J  and we are gravely concerned about the obstacles and impediments that South Africa continues to place on the track of the independence process. Because of the continuing irregularities in the implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  the minimum conditions for holding free and fair elections are still absent in Namibia. The continued existence of the notorious paramilitary Koevoat elements  which under different reasons harass and intimidate the local population in a reign of terror  is designed to disrupt the electoral campaign of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and enhance the electoral chances of Pretoria's puppets in Windhoek. This is a blatant sabotage of the independence process and is totally unacceptable. But what can one expect from a regime suffering from moral bankruptcy and institutional decadence? My delegation would therefore urge the Security Council to continue to intensify its efforts to bring pressure to bear on South Africa to comply with resolutions 435 (1978) and 640 (1989)  which will guarantee free and fair elections in Namibia leading to the early independence of the Territory.Apart from the critical situation in South Africa  the continent is still beset by the persistence of a number of regional disputes. It is our fervent hope and desire that these long-standing problems and the new ones that might emerge will finally be resolved within the framework of the organization of African Unity (OAU). The Gambia will give its full support to the endeavours of the current Chairman of the OAU  President Mohammed Hosni Mubarak of Egypt  to find a peaceful solution to these disputes.On Afghanistan  my delegation is very happy to note that foreign troops have now been withdrawn from that war-torn country and it is our hope that favourable conditions will be created to guarantee the safe return of all refugees to their country  thereby ensuring the restoration of peace and stability to Afghanistan. Once again I should like to take the opportunity to pay a tribute to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the valuable role it has played in providing refuge to millions of displaced Afghans and also for its endeavours to create an atmosphere conducive to the resolution of the Afghan problem.It is also gratifying to note the suspension of hostilities in fee conflict between Iran and Iraq  a conflict that has bedevilled the international community by fee intensity of its destructiveness. We strongly urge the two parties to co-operate in the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) so that fee peace process can result in fee attainment of the desired objective of a genuine and durable peace in the Gulf. An end to this fratricidal conflict not only would enable Iran and Iraq to undertake fee much-needed national reconstruction  but would also remove the threat of the internationalisation of the conflict in a region of strategic political and economic importance.The situation in Kampuchea continues to be of concern to my delegation. Despite the continued efforts of fee international community in the search for a peaceful solution 4so this protracted conflict that has resulted in immense suffering  fee problem still remains unresolved. It is hoped feat the recently suspended Paris Conference on Kampuchea will resume in the near future and that a negotiated comprehensive settlement will be achieved  a settlement based on fee independence  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Kampuchea. A genuine withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea will  it is hoped  accelerate fee peace process in that country  and my delegation calls on all parties to the dispute to continue to support fee efforts of fee United Nations and fee Association of South-East Asian Nations (asEAN) to resolve the problem of Kampuchea.With regard to the situation in fee Korean peninsula  fee Gambia welcomes fee process of dialogue initiated to ensure the reunification of that divided country  and we are of fee view feat if membership in fee United Nations would facilitate the process of unification the international community should support the admission of the Koreans into fee Organization  in accordance with the principles of universality.In the Middle East  the situation continues to pose a grave threat to international peace and security. My delegation wishes to reiterate the Gambia Government's conviction that the Palestine question is at the crux of the Middle East problem and that a just and permanent solution can be achieved only if the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to an independent homeland  are restored. The Palestinians have suffered for decades and have made many sacrifices in pursuit of their aspirations  as manifested by the 22-month-old intifadah. They have also made many concessions in the search for peace and security. These peace overtures are highly laudable  and we once again call on Israel to respond positively in order that the genuine search for peace in the Middle East can take off. He are convinced that unless the attitude of Israel changes the Middle East situation will continue to be a threat to world peace and security. It is for that reason that the United Nations must be closely involved in finding a solution to the problem in the Middle East  and in this connection my delegation renews its call for a United Nations-sponsored international conference on the Middle East with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.In the eastern Mediterranean  the Gambia will do all it can to encourage contacts and negotiations between the representatives of the two communities in Cyprus under the good offices of the United Nations Secretary-General. He therefore fully support the search for a mutually acceptable political arrangement which recognizes the equal status of the two communities in Cyprus.The seriously deteriorating situation in Lebanon gives cause for genuine concern. We therefore urge the warring factions to put an end to this unduly protracted conflict  which  in .addition to the heavy toll in terms of human and material costs  continues to pose a grave menace to the peace and stability of the region. We believe that any solution guaranteeing Lebanon's sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity must include the complete withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanese territory. In this spirit we express our support for the peace plan of the Tripartite Committee of Arab Heads of State  comprising the Kingdoms of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria  and we welcome the results achieved so far. Although the current session is taking place at a time of considerable improvement in the international political climate  deep structural imbalances in the world economy continue to characterize the current international economic environment. The most serious and critical of these imbalances is the widening socio-economic gap between the developed and the developing countries.These negative trends not only threaten the socio-economic and political fabric of developing countries but also will endanger international political security and peace and will undoubtedly undermine the positive effects of the ongoing relaxation of world tension.The current decade has seen very painful structural adjustments on the part of several developing countries  particularly the least developed ones in Africa. These countries  while already facing formidable structural handicaps  experienced a sharp deterioration in their overall socio-economic situation  in spite of significant domestic policy measures undertaken by them pursuant to the declared objectives and commitments contained in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development (1986-1990)  which was adopted in 1986.Their efforts  however  have in most cases yielded inadequate results owing to the insufficient flow of external assistance  unfavourable terms of trade and crippling debt-service obligations.The role of the United Nations system in mitigating the social effects of structural adjustments cannot be over-emphasized  in this regard  mention must be made of the valuable contributions of specialized agencies such as the United Nations Development programme (UNDP)  the united Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Economic  Social and Cultural organization (UNESCO) in the initiation and promotion of programmes feat address those sectors which are fee first to be adversely affected under structural adjustment programmes. In particular  fee Gambian delegation would like to command UNICEF for its tireless efforts in providing support and assistance to the most vulnerable group of our growing population - the child. In this respect  I should like to emphasize fee importance we attach to the draft convention on the rights of the child  which fee General Assembly will be called upon to adopt in the near future. I should like also to place on record our unequivocal support for the holding of a world summit on the child  as proposed by UNICEF.There is need  however  for the developed countries similarly to undertake appropriate structural reforms aimed at adjusting fee structural imbalances in their economies feat have given rise to high interest rates  fluctuations in commodity prices and a resurgence of protectionism - policies that are inimical to equitable international economic relations and also to the capability of developing countries to address fee serious economic problems confronting them.There is  finally  a need to develop a new debt strategy geared towards a substantial alleviation of fee burden on developing countries  including possible debt reduction  rescheduling on concessionary terms or debt write-offs. As we rejoice at some of the positive developments in current international relations  we are willing to acknowledge that other challenges continue to require the attention of the international community. We in the Gambia have been paying special attention to environmental issues. In this regard  we are deeply concerned at the threat of climatic changes  the over-exploitation of the earth's resources and the pollution of the seas. My delegation would therefore like to reaffirm the need to strengthen international concerted efforts and co-operation for environmental protection within the framework of the United Nations.We also welcome the increased international attention being paid to the inextricable link between the environment and development. My delegation would like to launch a solemn appeal from this rostrum for more supportive measures from the international community to help developing countries in their efforts to protect their environment. It is our hope that the United Nations conference on the environment and development  in 1992  will be able to address environmental issues from an overall and integrated perspective  making possible the formulation of action-oriented programmes with regard to the most urgent environmental and developmental problems facing mankind.The Gambia  being fully aware of the grave dangers posed to our survival by the dumping of toxic wastes  is committed to collaborating with all members of the organization of African Unity (OAU) in the dissemination of information on the movement of toxic wastes. The practice of the illegal dumping of these hazardous substances in mostly poor and developing countries is a serious phenomenon whose repercussions are as deadly as the trafficking in narcotics. Those involved in this practice of dumping hazardous wastes are traffickers in slew-motion death directed against developing countries  and their activities - nay  their trade - should be roundly condemned by the international community. A few weeks ago we held at the United Nations the second annual observance of the International Day against drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking  pursuant to the proclamation by the General Assembly in December 1987. The problem of drug abuse and illicit trafficking is of serious concern to my Government. In the words of the Secretary-General  which we endorse  the problem of drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs constitutes ""one of the most devastating threats facing the world today"". We in the Gambia therefore share the generally accepted view that the terrible dimensions of the drug phenomenon transcend frontiers and cut across political  economic and social boundaries. No country can handle it single-handed. No country can consider itself immune from it.The adoption  last December  of the International Convention against Illicit Trafficking in narcotic drugs and Psychotropic Substances can therefore be seen as a clear indication that Governments are now determined to co-operate against this new social evil  which is undermining the very foundations of our societies and destroying the future of our youth. The Gambia has already embarked on the necessary process of signing and ratifying this Convention.We should therefore like to appeal to the international community to make available the necessary resources  both at national level and within the relevant international bodies  for a more forceful  world-wide campaign against the production and use of all kinds of illicit drugs. In this regard  we should like to pay a tribute to the governments of the United States of America and of the United Kingdom for the valuable assistance they are providing in the fight against this modern-day scourge.An issue of cardinal importance to the Gambia is the question of human rights. The Government and people of the Gambia are firmly committed to the protection and promotion of human rights.It is true that recent developments on the international scene augur well for the future of multilateral diplomacy. However  the current favourable international climate of reduced tensions  the new spirit of co-operation between the major Powers and the achievement of peaceful solutions to many long-standing regional conflicts have not been matched by meaningful progress towards increased respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in some countries.While international machinery is already in place for the protection of human rights  it is still important for the international community to undertake a world-wide campaign and education to ensure that basic human rights are enjoyed by all persons everywhere on this planet  in keeping with the noble and worthy ideals embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human rights  adopted by this Assembly some 40 years ago.We in the Gambia maintain our position that the issue of human rights transcends the narrow barriers of self-centred political and economic interests. This firm sentiment to the observance of fundamental human rights is embodied in our domestic laws and manifested in our foreign policy. In order further to promote and consolidate our achievements in the field of human rights  the Gambia has taken the initiative of establishing an African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies. The Gambia Government has also provided the necessary infrastructure for the headquarters of the Commission on Human and People's Rights of the organization of African Unity (OAU) in Banjul  the Gambia. His Excellency the President of the Republic of Gambia  Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  whose commitment to human rights and democracy is renowned the world over  inaugurated the facilities for those institutions on 12 June this year.We should like to acknowledge the support given by the United Nations Geneva-based Commission on Human rights to the African Centre for Democracy andHunan rights  and we appeal to all those who have an abiding faith in the cause of human rights observance to support and provide assistance to the Centre.Given our stand on the issue of human rights  the Gambia cannot but be very concerned about the gross violations of the fundamental human rights of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria. The unprecedented deportation and expulsion of hundreds of thousands of people of Turkish origin from Bulgaria is a serious development which should be condemned by the entire international community. The pathetic sight of thousands of women and children being expelled from their own country on grounds of race and religion  and suffering in refugee camps  is intolerable  and the international community should speak out lest silence be taken to mean acquiescence. We call on Bulgaria to accept Turkey's invitation to enter into a meaningful dialogue so that an amicable solution be found to this humanitarian problem.My delegation therefore supports the proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of fee Federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Genscher  when he addressed the Assembly on 27 September about the need to appoint a United Nations high commissioner for human rights and set up an international court of human rights.The pressing political issues facing the international community are complex  but we share the hope of many feat  wife dedication and determination  they can be resolved  and in a way that assures peace and stability for all nations.On the economic front  hot/ever  there is a dire and compelling need for a whole range of North-South issues to be addressed wife greater political resolve and in a realistic and constructive manner that will take due account of fee acute and growing needs of the developing world in order to achieve a more balanced and equitable order.It is therefore imperative that the same dynamic and pragmatic spirit that has characterized international relations  which is indeed responsible for the recent developments on the political scene  should be extended to the economic sphere  with the hope that it will yield the long overdue desired results.I therefore conclude by reaffirming the Gambia  total commitment to the maintenance of peace and security and to meaningful international co-operation for the economic and social advancement of all peoples.The lofty ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations deserve our full attention  our firm dedication and energetic support.In this regard  we shall continue to render all necessary support to the United Nations system  which is and will remain the custodian of the hopes and aspirations of mankind for long-lasting peace  progress and prosperity."
"57",2727,"GNB",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. Garba's election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly is for my country  Guinea-Bissau  a source of great satisfaction. His qualities as a wise and experienced diplomat and his deep knowledge of the United Nations system and the major world problems all guarantee enlightened leadership in the work of this session.We are pleased that the unanimous choice of the international community has tills year beer  the representative of Nigeria  to which Guinea-Bissau Is tied by particular links of friendship  fraternity and co-operation. I assure him of our full co-operation.The excellent work done by his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  equally merits our full appreciation and thanks. We should also like to make a special mention of the Secretary-General of our Organist ion  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his perspicacious and innovative leadership of the United Nations and for his personal contribution to strengthening the role and prestige of the Organization.His report on the work of the Organization certainly reflects the complexity of the problems still facing the world; but it also reflects the efforts made by the United Nations over the past year to consolidate the ongoing peace process in some regions of the world  lessen dangers and attenuate conflicts in other areas of the planet. It also speaks of the specific initiatives aimed at strengthening international co-operation with regard to peace  security and development.The past year has been marked by events of great importance for mankind that seemed to confirm the depth of the changes occurring in the world in recent years.In this context the beginning of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia is doubtless one of the most significant events in world political life  an event whose effects go far beyond the borders of that African country. Namibia's independence will mark a decisive stage in the process off total liberation of the African continent and usher in a new era in the struggle of the peoples of southern Africa to establish a lasting peace and a climate of trust  understanding and co-operation in the region.The process of dialogue already begun in Angola and Mozambique  thanks to the openness aid clear desire for peace demonstrated by the Governments of these two countries  deserves the unanimous support of the international community. There are numerous examples in contemporary history of international solidarity and joint action to meet the aspirations and common interests of mankind  especially when these aspirations and interests are linked to international peace and security. The positive developments in the world political climate are largely the result of an awareness that the growing interdependence and integration in the world is in the common interest.Detente between the two super-Powers  the tendency towards lasting peaceful solutions  the establishment of dialogue and harmony over confrontation and use of force  as well as the primacy of law in the settlement of disputes between States  are new exerting a growing influence in structuring international relations at the end of this century. Thus we note with satisfaction the encouraging progress made in solving the questions of Western Sahara and Kampuchea and in working out a final settlement of the Chad-Libya dispute.Solidarity in the struggle to preserve the environment or against such destructive scourges as terrorism and drugs is a positive sign allowing foe a new vision of the future.But in speaking of the future we must now take into account the current negative aspects that daily continue to weigh heavily upon mankind.The persistence of the apartheid system in South Africa  repression in Palestine  confrontations between communities in Lebanon  the tragic situation in East Timor and the tensions still afflicting others areas in the world - especially in the Korean peninsula  Afghanistan and Cyprus - as well as the remaining vestiges of colonialism in some regions - all are still  unfortunately  matters of great concern to the international community  to which must be added the social and economic problems affecting much of mankind.The elimination of extreme poverty and misery in the world and meeting essential human needs - such as hygiene  health  education and housing - remain formidable challenges for individuals. States and the international community as a whole. The overwhelming majority of the world's population is daily confronted with shortages an& disease as a result of conditions of extreme deprivation.Africa  for example  is poorer today than it was 20 years ago. The World Bank predicts that this decline will continue over the next 10 years.According to tine Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  if the trends of recent years continue  per capita food production will continue to fall until the year 2010  and food self-sufficiency in Africa south of the Sahara will decrease by 85 per cent. The cereal deficit will increase from 20 million to 100 million tons  and food imports will reach  in constant prices  the figure of 32.5 billion  the equivalent of twice the amount envisaged for agricultural exports.What can be said of this indebtedness and its harmful consequences for our economies? The developing countries' debt service exceeds very greatly the flow of foreign capital  a situation that will worsen if urgent measures are not adopted to reverse this trend. The continued fall in the prices of our countries' products in international markets is a grave and constant obstacle to our development efforts.It is logical  therefore  that the question of development should be the focus of the international community's concerns and should no longer be regarded simply as ""assistance"".Development problems should be analysed in terms of concrete measures to guarantee minimal living standards and progress for all  by stimulating growth and promoting beneficial interaction between the economies of the developed and developing countries.This is really a major imperative of our times and a vital prerequisite for the full affirmation and enjoyment of mankind's political  economic and cultural rights. The adoption of appropriate and courageous measures to solve developing countries' economic and social problems is indeed a genuine priority  and tackling these problems requires now more than ever the eradication of their underlying causes. In tills context it is essential to stress the need for a new coexistence between States based on solidarity and reciprocity  a partnership consciously assumed by each one of us in a world where the ability of a small number of economically strong States to affect positively or negatively the future of the majority of mankind has never been as great or as real.This coexistence will require the final elimination of the psychological gap between the northern countries and the southern countries and the promotion of a constructive global dialogue on issues of vital importance for all mankind. But  as Amilcar Cabral stated. ""To coexist  one must first exist."" The real challenge is not to ensure the survival of disinherited populations  but rather to create conditions that guarantee their full rights and basic freedoms  and the blossoming of their creative abilities  making it possible for them to determine  consciously and responsibly  the best way to achieve development compatible with their true aspirations and the needs of our times. We believe it is this process that will ultimately yield true freedom for us  because  in our times  any scientific  technological or economic backwardness will inevitably affect the present and mortgage the future.The special session of the General Assembly to be devoted to international co-operation scheduled for 1990  will offer an appropriate framework for joint reflection on the best way to resume a constructive global dialogue on questions of development. We expect from the developed countries the openness and commitment that will make it possible to bring a new dynamism into international economic relations.The international development strategy for the 1990s must also reflect the commitment  desire and will of the entire community of nations to make the next decade a period of profound changes conducive to the economic rebirth of the third world countries. Mankind will then be able to begin the next millennium on new bases and to correct the imbalances created by unequal development in the twentieth century.In this regard  we should stress at this time the role of the united Nations  a role which is irreplaceable in the constant search for peace  the strengthening of International co-operation and development. The results obtained in carrying out this mission have made the Organization more credible and effective today and has earned it the confidence of mankind. The strengthening of the United Nations Is the most tangible expression of the unique nature and unity of mankind's aspirations and indicates that multilateralism  without which no world problem can truly be resolved  is as vital as ever. We are certain that ever more impressive results will be achieved in our quest for peace  world security and development.Our joint march along this path is the only viable choice for mankind. We must have the courage to take that path if we truly wish to build a more prosperous and more equitable future and to adjust to our world by better preserving it from any threat to its balance and potential prosperity. Therefore  the rich countries and the poor countries must build together a new humanism that will confirm our shared desire and will to make irreversible the present changes  which are so necessary for the establishment of a new type of relationship between States  based on the vision of a world with greater solidarity."
"58",2766,"GNQ",44,1989,"ï»¿The delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea comes to this session of the Assembly in the same spirit as it has always shown to join its efforts with those being devoted here to the service of the ideals of our Organization  ready to reaffirm and support all initiatives that can benefit the peoples. I wish to express ray delegation's satisfaction at the well-deserved election of Mr. Garba of Nigeria to direct the work of this session of the General Assembly. We are convinced that his outstanding talents and diplomatic skills  as well as the positive contribution of his country  Nigeria  to the task of consolidating international peace and stability  will help the Assembly to deal positively with the important and complex items on its agenda.Our congratulations are also directed to the other members of the Bureau. We our confident that their skill  experience  and unselfish efforts will enable them to contribute substantially to ensuring that the decisions and resolutions adopted will not only be in keeping with the principles and provisions of the Charter  but also make it possible again to enhance the Organization's authority in the solution of current international problems.In this connection  I can assure members of my delegation's total readiness to do its best to ensure that our work is to the point and achieves results satisfactory to all. The outstanding President of the forty-third session* Mr. Dante Caputo  and the members of his Bureau deserve our praise for the seriousness and competence they demonstrated and the substantial work accomplished during that session.A well-deserved tribute must be paid to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and his staff for their determined  positive efforts in the last ten years to solve the problems that are disrupting peace in various parts of our planet. The report of the Secretary-General reflects the delicate problems that will be under the scrutiny of States and their representatives at this session. The fact that there is a stalemate on many items as compared with obvious progress in the search foe suitable solutions to other problems shows that only readiness on the part of States or - which is one and the same thing - the practical application of the spirit and content of the principles of the Charter in solving problems that affect the international community can guarantee the peace  harmony  and well-being that all desire.Another obstacle on the road to more just treatment of States  and hence to relations that would give equal weight to everybody's needs  is the conduct of some countries  peoples and leaders who put their own interest before the general interest.That is why there is still inequality in international economic relations. There is a covert denial of the principles concerning recognition of the sovereign equality of States  the freedom of each State or people to choose the economic or political system that best meets its national interests  tine peaceful coexistence of States  and the imposition of pre-conditions on some countries with regard to their co-operation arrangements  thus restricting their right to freedom and sovereignty simply because they are receiving such co-operation.Equatorial Guinea's conviction that it is possible and indeed necessary to reinforce our organization's authority compels us to appeal to the Assembly for a wide-ranging dialogue which  through the use of the best ways and means available to us  would lead to an impartial guarantee of universal peace  security  and well-being  which in turn would involve stepping up the present negotiations on disarmament and socio-economic development.Political action in Equatorial Guinea has focused at all times on the attainment of the paramount goals of a modern State: unity  peace  justice and social well-being for the people. This action was embodied in the programme of democratisation contained in the historic Act of 31 August 1979. In carrying out that programme we have organized the society of Equatorial Guinea from its foundations and drafted laws governing that organization.The preparation of the law on political parties in Equatorial Guinea concluded this programme of democratisation. That law defines and recognizes the democratic principles of the State of Equatorial Guinea  on the basis of which we established the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea. Today we view the future with optimism and feel proud to have regained our political freedoms  which are indispensable for our progress and the achievement of our goal of national development.During these years of arduous work  the Government  worthily headed by His Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  has enjoyed the full and unconditional support of the people of Equatorial Guinea  in a deep spirit of fraternal coexistence  peace and unity  guaranteeing the consolidation of the process of democratisation. The first Congress of the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea  convened in the city of Bata exactly one year ago  named His Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo the President. A few months later he was proposed as the candidate in the presidential elections on 25 June last.The people of Equatorial Guinea  in a democratic spirit  went in large numbers to the voting booths to exercise their right to vote in these first presidential elections since the country achieved independence 21 years ago. By an overwhelming result of 99.96 per cent in favour  the people of Equatorial Guinea demonstrated the political maturity they had acquired from the country's recent experience and from the dynamic action encouraged by the Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea.Accordingly  I can state to the Assembly that the process of democratisation in my country has achieved a very positive level  enabling all the citizens to become aware of their responsibility to participate actively in political  economic and social affairs  not merely as spectators but as direct actors on the stage of our history.  Today  12 October 1989 - the exact date on which I spoke before the General Assembly last year - my country is commemorating 20 years of existence as a sovereign and independent State. It is also the anniversary of our joining) the Hispanic world. In this regard  we congratulate all the countries of the world  and particularly those of the Hispanic world. The distance between States and continents has yielded to technological progress. That is why my country  of the Hispanic persuasion although on the African continent  feels close to the Hispanic peoples and shares the concerns of the Hispanic community.As a result  I take this opportunity to appeal to the Hispanic States and peoples  echoing the desire and mission of the people of Equatorial Guinea  for an increase in our co-operation in all sectors of: development. One cannot want what one does not knew about. As a result  a physical presence in Malabo  Equatorial Guinea;  is necessary if a contribution is to be made to the best possible development of our co-operation. Prom this rostrum  we extend our warmest welcome to all those who will come.This session has been convened at a time when all the countries and peoples of the world expect our Organization thoroughly to study the various international questions on its agenda. We believe that the course of our history will change qualitatively and quantitatively if greater understanding among States is achieved  thereby consolidating what has already been done to lessen existing tensions in various areas of the world. The participation of the Secretary-General in this work has contributed to enhancing the authority of our organization. That shows the need to pursue this work in order to ensure peace and harmony between peoples.We believe that the time has come for intransigence to yield to understanding on the long road towards decolonisation. He know that there can be no reason for excessive optimism so long as the important Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  contained ?n General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) is not implemented.The situation in Namibia remains a matter of concern because of South Africa's failure to comply with the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which was confirmed in the debate that took place from6 to 29 August last and in the report of the Committee of 18 on its mission to Namibia from 7 to 16 August.My Government reaffirms in this forum its view that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) must be implemented in its final and definitive form  as that constitutes the only acceptable way for the people of Namibia to participate in free and just elections  under the supervision of the United Nations.My Government continues to be concerned about the tense and dangerous situation in southern Africa. The destabilizing conduct of the racist Pretoria regime has turned the insecurity of living conditions and the systematic violation of the sovereignty of the front-line States into law and custom. There is no justification for the insolent conduct towards the peoples of southern Africa. The tragic situation inflicted on thousands of refugees and repatriated and displaced persons by a regime that behaves in a manner contrary to the principles and decisions of the United Nations requires Member States to work together to put an end to the excesses perpetrated by that regime and to bring its behaviour into line with that of the rest of the world.The reasonable thing for the racist leaders to do would be to face historical facts and to take action to enable all South Africans  without any distinctions whatsoever  to become actively involved in the solution of the country's problems. In this connection  my Government rejects and strongly condemn the racist elections held in South Africa on 6 September last  from which  contrary to the well-known demands of the South African people  the broad majority of the population was excluded. Apartheid must absolutely be eradicated by strict adherence to the principles of the Charter and by unequivocal support for the just solution that is clear to the entire international community.My Government is pleased to note the political will and constructive spirit evinced by the People's Republic of Angola in the search foe a peaceful and negotiated solution to the national and regional problems of that fraternal country. In this connection  we support the Gbadolite agreements of 22 June  which were ratified at the summit meeting of the eight African Heads of State on 22 August in Harare. given their importance  recent events call for further thought. I refer to the proclamation of the Palestinian State. The people of Palestine should find solution if the relevant United Nations resolutions  with which we are all familiar  are respected. We believe that the will of Palestine as expressed in the declaration of its national council in Algeria in November 1988  in the peace initiative announced by President Arafat at the plenary meeting of the General Assembly in Geneva on 13 December 1988  and in the support expressed by Arab State   in the course of the special summit conference in Casablanca in May this year .or that peace initiative represents a positive contribution to a solution of the problem that pits the PLO against the State of Israel. Such initiatives should be sorted in this forum  and we should make a start on the path towards dialogue that is lead to a peaceful solution acceptable to both parties to the dispute. It is a matter of ongoing concern to my Government that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) have not yet bean implemented. To date  these resolutions remain the only valid  positive means of guaranteeing peace in the Middle East.However  we welcome the progress made at the first and second informal meetings held in Jakarta in July 1988 and February 1989  as well as the international conference on Kampuchea held in Paris from 30 July to 30 August this year. They made a meaningful contribution to a global solution that would satisfy all parties.Similarly  we welcome the recent meetings between the Government of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community. We believe that continuing substantive dialogue between the two communities may constitute the only way to achieve a just  and lasts. solution to that problem. The uncertain situation on the Korean peninsula is no less alarming so long as the division of the peninsula continues. We hope that at this politically important time an increasingly open positive and constructive dialogue will be begun with a view to achieving a balance of peace and meeting hopes of national reunification.In this connection* we hope feat a more wide-ranging and responsible dialogue will contribute to putting an end to Argentina's dispute with the United Kingdom with regard to free Malvinas Islands.My country welcomes wife great satisfaction  and is very interested in  all negotiations leading towards peaceful solutions to all domestic and international problems and conflicts. In this spirit  we should like to express our thanks and acknowledgment to fee Secretary-General for his efforts to put and end to fee dispute between Iran and Iraq. We congratulate those two countries on their decision to observe fee cease-fire feat began on 20 August this year  which has contributed greatly to the alleviation of tension in that area. We believe that speedy and full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) might lead to a general and just solution to the problem.Similarly  we congratulate fee fraternal peoples of Chad and Libya for fee will that both have expressed  and we hope that implementation of resolution 184 (XXV) of fee Organisation of African Unity (OAU) will contribute to fee achievement of a peaceful settlement of their border disputes.The negotiations feat were conducted between fee parties involved as a result of OAU recommendations give us to understand that the problem of Western Sahara will see a positive solution that satisfies all concerned.However  we remain concerned about the situation prevailing in Afghanistan. We believe feat implementation of fee Geneva Agreements and of General Assembly resolution 43/20  leading to a political solution to the problem that afflicts the Afghan people  would indeed constitute an important contribution.The hotbeds of tension in Latin America and the Caribbean resulting from the deliberate manipulation of imported ideologies cause us growing concern. My Government hopes - indeed  it is entirely convinced - that the peace accords signed recently at Tela  Honduras  and the very positive role played by the Contadora Group and the Support Group will be fundamental in finding a political solution to the Central American crisis.Important steps have recently been taken to reduce the threat of destruction hanging over mankind. We applaud the decision by the two super-Powers to reduce their warâwaging arsenals  which have imperilled international peace and security. What we want  however  is not a mere reduction but total elimination of nuclear weapons from our planet. We urge the other nuclear Powers to show the same desire as the United States and the Soviet Union to negotiate a global agreement to dismantle all weapons of all types. That might constitute the best contribution they could make to the cause of peace and security throughout the world  as they are protagonists of our time.Despite the increasing degree of interdependence  there has been an increase in the inequalities and in the socio-economic imbalances between the developed countries and the underdeveloped countries. These trends are bound to constitute a threat to peace and stability throughout the world. We express our deep and abiding concern about the drastic deterioration in the economic situation in the great majority of developing countries. These countries  which are trying to develop despite their unfavourable situation  stubbornly continue to work hard to adjust their economies. However  in current conditions  which are so adverse  and in the  absence of simultaneous adjustment by developed countries  such efforts increasingly raise the social and political price.The international political panorama facing the developing countries is sensitive and unfavourable; the prices of commodities decline constantly and systematically; the terns of trade deteriorate daily; all kinds of protectionism are becoming more acute; the flew of capital investment is declining  and interest rates are still high in real terms; monetary and financial instability and inequality in the terms of trade persist  and it remains impossible to achieve the desired goals; external debt has become an irreversible burden that gets less bearable daily  and a problem the developing countries find increasingly difficult to solve.None the less  we highly appreciate and praise the position taken by some developed countries in totally or partially forgiving the external debt contracted by developing countries. That helps developing countries carry out more appropriate and reasonable structural adjustments and improve their economic and social situation.The Government  the Democratic Party and the people of Equatorial Guinea consider that current economic trends and the grave economic situation of developing countries require the urgent adoption of measures and action to foster substantive structural reforms in the context of international economic relations with a view to establishing a system that will contribute to constant equitable growth in the world economy. That is why we favour the establishment of a new international economic order as a broad  workable and valid framework for the world-wide effort to achieve social and economic development.The Republic of Equatorial Guinea is convinced that the convening in April 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and  in particular  to reactivating economic growth and development in developing countries will provide an opportunity to achieve a new consensus on action based on that growth and development. We believe that the international development strategy for the fourth UnitedNations development decade will provide a cohesive framework for international co-operation for the coming decade and will spell out the commitments that will contribute  in the common interest  to hastening and consolidating economic and social progress in developing countries. That strategy should include among its major goals special international support for the least developed countries  which include my country.External debt is the greatest handicap to the economic and social development of developing countries. High real interest rates currently consume a disproportionate part of the export income  the gross domestic product and the savings of underdeveloped countries. The sacrifices made by the peoples of those countries have caused serious social disruption  threatening their economic and social stability. It is difficult for those countries to pay their external debt in view of the current economic situation.We believe that solving the problem of external debt depends principally on the creation of conditions more favourable to more rapid economic development in debtor countries  on the basis of joint responsibility  through co-operation between all the parties concerned  including the Governments of debtor countries  the Governments of creditor countries and the World Bank and other international financial institutions.Like so many other peoples  the people of Equatorial Guinea is deeply concerned about the drug trafficking and illegal drug use which in recent years have reached alarming proportions in many countries. The growing magnitude of this problem amounts to a social calamity for mankind and must be fought courageously and decisively on all fronts and with all available national and international weapons. drug trafficking destabilizes the very structure of States  using corruption and the most varied criminal resources in an intricate network of operations  conspiracies and schemes involving ail social strata and the most powerful economic sectors  including the fundamental structures of public power. In some States  this poses a threat to national security and sovereignty. It is time  therefore  to view this as a universal problem  because of the social  economic and political factors at stake.I wish also to address the role of the international community in the world of science and technology. Today more than ever before it is necessary to support the creation in third-world countries of a network of world-scope institutions and research centres devoted to implementing  developing and promoting the most advanced technology. It is necessary to encourage and organize broader and more coherent international co-operation in that sphere. To achieve this  we must adopt without delay an international code of conduct on the genuine transfer and exchange of technology. In the context of those convictions and criteria  we in Equatorial Guinea have established a council for scientific research  which has already taken the first steps in its research. From this rostrum we appeal to the international community to work together to accelerate and support efforts in that sector.I cannot conclude without saying that Equatorial Guinea appreciates and values the efforts made since 1982  the year of the first donors' conference for the economic revitalization of our country  held in Geneva under United Nations auspices. Those efforts have made possible a new plan of structural adjustment and tangible economic improvements in our society  in keeping with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.We are certain that the programme for sectoral meetings adopted during the most recent follow-up round-table of the donors' conference  held in November 1988 in Geneva  will be effectively and punctually implemented with a view to achieving its aims  thanks to the ongoing support of the United Nations Development programme and the three major donors: the World Bank  Spain and France.I wish in conclusion to reaffirm my conviction that  under the excellent guidance of Major-General Garba  the Assembly will achieve the desired success."
"59",2812,"GRC",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of my Government  I wish at the outset to extend warmest congratulations to you  Sir  on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are indeed deeply satisfied that a most distinguished representative of Nigeria  a country with which Greece maintains traditionally the closest relations of friendship and co-operation  has been elected by acclamation to this prestigious office. Your vast experience in the work of the Organization and the leadership and diplomatic skills you have displayed ensure that you will discharge with success the duties with which you are entrusted. I take this opportunity also to assure you that we recall most vividly your last visit to Athens  when as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid you co-chaired the symposium entitled ""Culture against apartheid"".I avail myself of this opportunity to express to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Foreign Minister of Argentina  our deep appreciation for the able and inspired manner in which he guided with great effectiveness the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.My personal thoughts turn also to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  to whom I wish to express my admiration for his untiring efforts in efficiently leading the United Nations in its task of maintaining international peace and security. I wish to congratulate him on the report on the work of the Organization he recently presented to us. His review of international developments brings home  in bold and lucid terms  the acuteness of tensions in areas where violence and injustice are  unfortunately  still the norm in the everyday life of peoples and countries - all this against a growing consciousness that the United Nations can be more effective in the prevention of conflicts and the suppression of acts of aggression. In short  he has presented ""a credible strategy of peace"".Earlier this week the Foreign Minister of France  Mr. Roland Dumas  in his capacity as President of the European Economic Community  made a statement on behalf of the 12 States Members of the European Community. My Government fully concurs with the views expressed on issues that are central to our concerns and to our aspirations. For my part  I should like also to point to the new hopes raised in Europe in the wake of a historic evolution which should  we hope  lead to the elimination of confrontations and to the attenuation of divisions. It is that same Europe  which  as the Secretary-General does not fail to mention  was plunged 50 years ago this very month into a most savage and destructive conflict  which eventually engulfed other continents. Greece survived that holocaust  devastated but with an unshakable faith in democracy  human dignity and justice  the very purposes and principles of the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter.The openness and restructuring that are defining current developments in Eastern and Central Europe constitute a political event of historical dimensions. Relief of unparalleled importance has been brought forward in the theatre of European relations  affecting overall world affairs. Greece has contributed actively to this process which marks a turning point in the relations between East and West on the European continent. We are convinced that confidence can replace mistrust and that co-operation should replace confrontation. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe has played a major role in creating an advanced stage of co-operation among the 35 participating States. The Concluding Document issued at its last Session in Vienna  marks an important step in the Helsinki process. The Forum of Information  held in London  and the Conference on the Human Dimension  held in Paris more recently  give the measure of the further progress achieved in two most sensitive areas. Within the framework of 'die process established by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  regional co-operation in the Balkan peninsula has been a most significant development. My country takes satisfaction from the fact that it was the first to propose the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act on a regional basis. Since then  we have been consistently committed to the advancement of this co-operation with our Balkan neighbours  seeking to enlarge the range of areas of common interest. Following the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the six Balkan countries in Belgrade last year  a series of specialized meetings have been organized consecutively in various capitals. An important meeting of high officials is planned to take place in Athens in the coming months. We shall spare no effort towards the furtherance of this process  which serves peace and stability in our region. As regards neighbouring Turkey  we would like to develop in our relations a climate enabling us to establish in the near future a serious dialogue that would bring us to an era of peace  friendship and co-operation.Efforts leading to nuclear and conventional disarmament remain at the centre of our preoccupations. These efforts  primarily deployed in the framework of the United Nations system  are obviously influenced by the progress of bilateral talks between the two nuclear super-Powers. The Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - concluded in December 1987  and the negotiations for the reduction by 50 per cent of their respective nuclear arsenals  have a direct bearing on the general relaxation in international tensions. In Europe again  the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (GSCE) remains the most efficient negotiating framework for conventional disarmament. We earnestly look forward to the success of negotiations initiated recently in Vienna aiming at the reduction of such weapons in Europe  and also to an agreement on a new set of confidence- and security-building measures.Beyond the confines of European initiatives  we look forward to a successful conclusion of the negotiations for the prohibition of chemical weapons carried out within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The United Nations should continue to provide to the international community the institutional framework for disarmament negotiations. Without being unduly pessimistic  we should place in their true dimensions both the seemingly fruitless results of the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament and the more inconclusive last session of the Disarmament Commission.If  in the words of the Secretary-General  ""the United Nations needs to demonstrate its capacity to function as guardian of world security""  its Member States should be conscious - as indeed they are - of the true nature of regional conflicts as well as of the nature of the solutions achieved  or to be achieved. In a tightly interdependent world  no regional problem loses its international character  the more so when the Organization is seized of it. The involvement of the United Nations suggests that the extent to which it can contribute toward solutions greatly depends on the existence of a genuine political will for the maintenance of peace and security by the parties directly concerned. The most notable examples in this respect are the agreement between Iran and Iraq for a cease-fire in the region of the Gulf following resolution 598 (1987)  unanimously adopted by the Security Council  the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan and the New York agreements on Namibia signed in December 1988. A few years earlier  these problems seemed to be insoluble. However  diplomatic skill and patience  in parallel with the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General  but primarily with the efforts of the parties directly involved  have brought to an end the military conflict between Iran and Iraq. We express the hope that both parties will co-operate intensively with the Secretary-General on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).The same skill and patience has produced an agreement for the withdrawal of foreign military forces from Afghanistan. Similarly  it has brought about agreements for the disengagement of alien forces and other elements from Namibia and from Angola  in the framework of an overall solution designed in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). However  we are still deeply concerned that in the regions just mentioned the agreements reached  or the peace plans and other arrangements pursued  have not yet come to full fruition and have not as yet succeeded in eliminating grave internal problems. National reconciliation is at stake in Afghanistan and local conditions are far from giving hope for an early return of the refugees to their homes in safety and honour.In Namibia  we have been following with some concern the strenuous efforts of the United Nations to establish normal conditions to secure free and fair elections in time for the agreed date  early November 1989  as well as for the return of refugees. The plight of prisoners of war still held by the former belligerents in the region of the Gulf  where other serious problems have still to be resolved  delays the implementation of the settlement plan laboriously pursued by the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative.Greece is following with particular interest developments in South Africa  where the situation continues  regretfully  to endanger peace  security and stability in the area. The state of emergency is still in force throughout the country  while sporadic positive developments  such as the release of a number of political detainees  fall short of constituting the fundamental change that the situation requires. Anti-apartheid organizations are still banned and harassed  and their activities are restricted by all kinds of repressive measures. We hope that recent developments in that country will lead to the complete and peaceful eradication of apartheid by an effective national dialogue across political  religious and colour distinctions  with a view to establishing a free  democratic and non-racial South Africa.In Central America  the Esquipulas II agreement and the recent Tela agreements supported by the Presidents of the five countries of the region lead us to hope that agreements to terminate military activities from one territory to another  to end internal strife and to guarantee the democratic process will be crowned with success. Observer groups to be eventually established by the United Nations to verify and control the peace process under way nay be part of a substantial contribution by this Organization. In Kampuchea  in the Western Sahara and  last but not least  in the Middle East  the impasse persists  and the United Nations has not yet been in a position to enhance effectively a few positive steps taken in any of the cases mentioned. The inconclusive results of the Paris Conference on Cambodia do not prevent us from noting that the Vietnamese forces seem to be keeping to their timetable of withdrawal. The peace plan presented by the Secretary-General to the opposing parties in the Western Sahara still remains a valid proposal for a just and lasting agreement. However  the persistence of Israel in occupying since 1967 Palestinian and other Arab territories  including East Jerusalem  aggravates the already harsh conditions of life of the civilian population in the occupied territories and remains the main obstacle to a just solution in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We believe that the settlement of the Middle Eastern question can be reached by the convening of the International Peace Conference under the auspices of the United Nations  leading to talks in which all the directly interested parties should participate  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).We are deeply concerned by the tragic conditions prevailing in Lebanon. We call upon all parties to refrain from the use of force and to reach  through peaceful negotiations  a solution that will guarantee the unity  sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of this country. We are particularly satisfied that the plan of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League appears to have been accepted  thus paving the way for the return of peace in that country  torn for so many years by internal strife.With regard to the Korean Peninsula  we welcome President Roh's new unification formula as well as any proposal aiming at reducing tension in the area. The South Korean Government has our support and encouragement in its efforts to promote unification through peaceful and democratic means. A brief review of cases regarding regional conflicts inevitably brings forward a pattern on which the United Nations is invited to act or is acting  in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly.This pattern of United Nations involvement leads us to take note of two distinct levels of action encompassing each problem as a whole. The first level of action refers to the external aspect of a problem  which as a rule is relevant to the prevention or termination of an armed confrontation  the withdrawal of foreign military forces of occupation or foreign elements alien to a country whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated. The second level of action normally relates to the internal aspect of a regional problem  which  as previous examples clearly denote  consists of internal strife and the need for national reconciliation  the settlement of refugee problems  and the enforcement of human rights and the rule of law. In varying degrees  as circumstances in each case dictate  the United Nations is called upon  usually through the good offices of the Secretary-General  to assist in the settlement of a conflict  acting at the two distinct levels I have just mentioned.Allow me now to refer in a more extensive way to the Cyprus problem  the persistence of which is of special concern to Greece and to the United Nations as a whole.It is evident that for the last 15 years there has been a manifest lack of will on the Turkish side to reach a solution that would allow the two communities of Cyprus to enjoy the full fruits of independence to their mutual benefit. The Turkish invasion of 1974 and the continuing military occupation of more than a third of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus constitute a most blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and of the resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly. The resulting plight of the Cypriot people is well known. I wish again to remind the Assembly that some 200 000 people had to flee their ancestral homes and have become refugee? in their own country  while to this day 1 619 missing persons are still unaccounted for. Furthermore  advantage has been taken of the continuing occupation of the northern part of Cyprus by Turkish military forces to bring in thousands of Turkish settlers in order to alter the demographic structure of the island. Ensuing acts of secession and partition were unequivocally condemned by resolutions of the Security Council  which has repeatedly called upon Turkey to withdraw its forces from the island. Mention should also be made of the looting of cultural treasures and the destruction of objects and monuments of historic value and places devoted to worship. To all this it should now be added that  according to recent disturbing indications  the Turkish-Cypriot side seems to be planning to install new Bulgarian Muslim settlers in the occupied part of the territory of the Republic.Efforts to bring about a solution to the Cyprus problem entered a new  more hopeful phase after the new initiative taken in July 1988 by the Secretary-General in the framework of his mission of good offices. The President of the Republic of Cyprus has striven to conduct meaningful talks with the leader of the Turkish-Cypriot community under the auspices of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  with a view to reaching a solution that should be just and lasting  for the benefit of all citizens of Cyprus. We believe that President Vassiliou is right in addressing simultaneously the two aspects of the problem  namely  the withdrawal of all foreign military troops  eventually entailing the full demilitarisation of the territory of the Republic  and the reconciliation and coming-together of all Cypriots  regardless of ethnic origin. Greece supports the initiative of the Secretary-General and the efforts of the President of Cyprus.However  we are deeply concerned by the new obstacles the other side has created. After some progress had been made in the course of three rounds of intensive talks  that side rejected the evolutionary process which the Secretary-General was pursuing with both parties to the dialogue in accordance with agreed procedures. In actual fact  the leader of the Turkish-Cypriot community suspended his participation in the talks in a manner which has put in jeopardy the Secretary-General's mission of good offices itself.I repeat that Greece  for its part  shall continue to give its full support to the Secretary-General's mission of good offices. At the same time  we will not fail to denounce in unequivocal terms the lack of response from the other side to the endeavours towards a just and viable solution to the problem of Cyprus. Its international dimension and the aggravation resulting from the military occupation of part of the territory of a sovereign State  a Member of this Organization  constitute a permanent threat to peace and security.I should be remiss if I did not pay a tribute to all the men and women who form the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations for their dedication in fulfilling a most noble task in the service of international peace. Greece has consistently supported United Nations peace-keeping activities. A Hellenic Air Force aircraft flew to Windhoek in Namibia on 7 June  carrying supplies for the use of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group as a contribution from the people and Government of Greece. Next month  Greek civil servants will join their colleagues from other countries to carry out their duties as electoral supervisors at the elections scheduled for early November in Namibia.I should like to stress that we fully support and strive for the establishment of a financially secure and sound basis for all peace-keeping operations. Peace  and by extension peace-keeping operations  is the collective responsibility of all mankind. It follows that expenses for such operations  without exception  should be mandatory to all Members of the United Nations and assessed in accordance with the established scale of contributions. It has been stated before on behalf of the Greek Government that the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus remains the only peace-keeping force to be financed by voluntary contributions  thus placing at risk the mission with which it is entrusted. I appeal to all Member States to support the Secretary-General's proposal to correct what appears to be an anomaly and an exception to the rule of financing peace-keeping forces through assessed contribution.An overall review of world conditions would not be complete without a strong reminder that respect for human rights constitutes an active concern of the international community and is no longer an internal matter of each individual State. Our external policies are also influenced by the respect human rights are enjoying in other countries.The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has been instrumental in promoting the legal and political concepts emanating from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In Europe  and in particular among the 35 participating States to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  an important step was taken by the Concluding Document of the Vienna session  whereby a mechanism to monitor and control the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms was instituted. We shall actively participate in that process. At the same time  we do not fail to note with interest the prominence constantly given to a universal acceptance of the need for full respect of human rights and individual freedoms. The Declaration recently adopted by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at its summit conference at Belgrade gives ample proof of that positive development.We are deeply concerned by the increased activities and costly implications of transnational drug trafficking. The trafficking of drugs is no longer an isolated national issue. It constitutes a global problem of grave social dimensions. Transnational and organized forms of crime have become so powerful that they challenge legal and democratic institutions in some countries. They are eroding the moral fibber of society. However  the fight against drug trafficking is receiving increased political support world-wide. For our part  we have declared a relentless war against drug dealers and their supporters. Further  Greece has joined other nations in signing  on 23 February 1989  the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances that was adopted last December. There is an urgent need for increased co-operation on a multilateral basis and the most appropriate forum for that purpose is provided by the United Nations. The question of international terrorism is also on the Assembly's agenda at the current session. The international community continues to be plagued by acts of the meanest and most cowardly form of violence. States members of the United Nations are uniting to co-ordinate their efforts in combating heinous crimes perpetrated at random or at will against innocent persons. Greece has not been spared from being the target of such crimes  but we have not been shaken in our determination and efforts to eradicate this scourge within the framework of international endeavours undertaken to that end.Another problem I should like to single out is the destruction of the environment  which threatens the very existence of our planet today and degrades the quality of life. Greece  facing serious environmental problems  is in favour of dealing with this matter at both the international and the national levels. We attach great importance to the convening of a United Nations special conference in 1992 on environment and development. We believe that the conference must establish an international strategy and adopt ways and means with a view to obtaining sustainable and environmentally sound development in all countries. As far as my country is concerned  we shall spare no effort for its successful conclusion.The 1980s represented a decade of contrast and diversity of developmental experiences. Progress has been accomplished in raising living standards and strengthening democratic institutions. However  large masses of people in some regions continue to live under unacceptable economic  social and political conditions. The debt crisis has become crushing in a large number of developing countries. It has blurred the distinction between social and economic issues  which are increasingly perceived in much the same way world-wide.Greece contributed to the negotiation and adoption of decision 43/460 calling for a special session to be devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalization of economic growth and development of developing countries. It continues to play an active role in preparations for the session through the assumption of the chairmanship of the Preparatory Committee. The special session is seen as an opportunity to place development at the top of the world political agenda again  at a time when the relaxation of tensions in international relations has led to improved prospects for international economic co-operation.Greece  a founding member of the United Nations  remains fully committed to the ideals enshrined in the Charter and to the multilateral approach. We therefore strongly feel that the United Nations should continue to intensify its efforts and exploit the best opportunities to resolve international problems through strengthened co-operation. The ultimate goal of achieving peace  security and prosperity remains as valid as ever. In this regard I share some of the optimism expressed in the report of the Secretary-General when he states that ""peace has gained a meaning and a dimension that it lacked before"". Peace  justice and human dignity appear to be assuming the dimensions of multilateral endeavours. This is the task of the United Nations  to which we are fully committed."
"60",2853,"GRD",44,1989,"ï»¿I bring greetings from the Government and people of Grenada. My delegation joins in the many eloquent expressions of confidence and trust reposed in the President's great diplomatic and interpersonal skills as he presides  with unparalleled confidence and competence over the deliberations of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Additionally  ray delegation places on record our admiration and esteem for the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  Mr. Dante Caputo  for his outstanding conduct of the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly.The ray of light that burst forth on the international scene during the closing days of the forty-third session of the General Assembly gives hope that  as the curtain continues to rise on the Assembly's forty-fourth session  international peace and goodwill can be sustained  to the end that nations will increase their trust in one another and feel safer end more secure in their deliberations and interactions.The Secretary-General of the United Nations  an ardent advocate of peace  has  during his extensive travels to many geographical regions  advanced the peace process by his quiet  effective and skilful diplomacy. It is now left to the national leaders and those who walk the corridors of power to sail with the favourable wind that is blowing and the favourable tide that is flowing in the direction of international peace and security. To quote the Secretary-General in his recent address to the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade ""Never before in the history of the Non-Aligned Movement was there the fluidity in international affairs that we see today."" That fluidity in international affairs so eloquently described by Mr. Perez de Cuellar gives hope for the peaceful resolution of erstwhile conflicts in many areas of the world where  lately  signs of peace have emerged for the greater good.The three-dimensional aspect of the conflict in the region of southern Africa - namely  the question of Namibia  the destabilization of the front-lineStates  and the vicious  diabolical and institutionalised practice of racism  apartheid - is beginning to shows signs of that fluidity to which the Secretary-General referred.Namibia is the best example. This last African colony  please God  will soon throw off the shackles of colonialism and take its place in the community of independent nations  where it rightfully belongs. The prospect of independence for Namibia came closer in December 1988 here at the United Nations when  in impressive ceremonies  a bilateral agreement was signed by Cuba and Angola to allow for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Similarly  a tripartite agreement was signed by Cuba  Angola and South Africa by which South Africa undertook to withdraw its forces from Namibia in like manner. This enabled the Secretary-General of the United Nations to establishment and dispatch the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and the United Nations Angola Verification Mission to the region  in accordance with Security Council resolution 626 (1988)  of 20 December 1988  thereby implementing the Security Council's overall plan for Namibia enclosed in its resolution 435 (1978).The initial difficulties and frustrations encountered since 1 April  when the United Nations team arrived in Namibia  should be worked out in a spirit of determination and goodwill on all sides to ensure Namibia's independence at the appointed time. We cannot afford to defer this to another time. To paraphrase the immortal William Shakespeare  there is a tide flowing in the direction of independence) if missed  it will cause misery in the lives of a gallant and determined people. Now is the accepted time. New is the time for Namibia's deliverance from oppressive forces. Now is the time to bring glad tidings to the poor  to proclaim liberty for captives and to give release to prisoners. If Namibia succeeds  it will create a psychological climate that will hasten the pulling-down of the odious  wicked and outdated practice of apartheid and its attendant pressures on the front-line States. The attention of the entire international community is focused on South Africa to see whether its new President is capable of ushering in the new society he has promised  or whether his so-called new approach is a mere tactical manoeuvre to consolidate his hold on power. The Government and people of Grenada  and history  will judge President De Klerk by his conduct rather than by his words. In any event  the writing is on the wall for all to see  even the architects and proponents of that barbarous practice.An integral and significant dimension of the situation in South Africa is the continued detention of Nelson Mandela  the undisputed leader of the majority of the people of that country. It is immoral and a display of cowardice on the part of the South African Government to attempt to pursue negotiations with Mandela at this time with a view to resolving the problems which beset the country. The bargaining power is clearly unequal.He therefore call on the South African Government to release him unconditionally now to facilitate meaningful dialogue between the parties in dispute. Mandela must be capable of forming an entirely free and unfettered judgement  totally independent of any measure of control.The recently concluded Paris Conference on Cambodia  while not removing all the obstacles to peace  nevertheless gives hope that peace is possible in that region. That is borne out by the fact that the Cambodian parties accepted the Secretary-General's idea of organizing a preliminary fact-finding mission to gather on-site technical data to facilitate further substantive discussion in the pursuit of peace.The problem in the Korean peninsula  a legacy of the Second World War and its aftermath  is a perfect example of how rivalry between great Powers  away from their borders but on the borders of far-away neighbours  can divide a once closely knit and industrious people  linked by consanguinity  affinity and cultural e elation ship.The recent proposal made by President Roh Tae Hoc of the Republic of Korea to the National Assembly that North and South Korea adopt the national community charter in order to form a Korean commonwealth between the two Koreas offers much hope as an interim association in preparation for national unification. It is hoped that  with continued dialogue and constant contact between North and South Korea  the way will be cleared for the adoption of the charter by 15 August 1990 - the forty-fifth anniversary of the unnatural Korean division or dichotomy - thereby creating once again one nation  one people of remarkable talent and industry. If this proposal does not gain acceptance  there should be no impediment to admission to membership in the community of nations of the Republic of Korea and North Korea.In Western Sahara  the peace plan submitted by the Secretary-General and the head of the Organization of African Unity  followed by the Secretary-General's proposal for the establishment of a technical commission to implement the proposal  has been well received by Morocco and the POLISARIO Front. high-level meetings between the two parties have been taking place through the good offices of the Secretary-General  and it is hoped that with goodwill on all sides the settlement that has long eluded us will finally be cornered and achieved.In much the same way  the communal talks in Cyprus  though at a crucial stage  offer hope for peaceful settlement with the help of the Secretary-General and his Representatives. In the interim  the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus deserves the full support of the international community as it strives to provide a buffer and maintain the peace between the Greek and Turkish communities.The Geneva Agreement of 14 April 1988 which paved the way for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan was a promising step towards a peaceful settlement  and while intermittent attacks still continue the level of conflict is considerably diminished and there is reduced human suffering. This is therefore an opportune time for the international community to seize upon that initiative and to do everything necessary to ensure a permanent end to the fighting and the commencement of a level of dialogue that could pave the way to a negotiated political solution. In that connection  my delegation wishes to congratulate the Prime Minister of Pakistan for the contribution contained in her recent statement on the Afghan question. In the Middle East  the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war which took effect slightly more than a year ago is still holding  despite occasional charges and counter-charges on both sides. There is therefore more promise for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) for the restoration of stability and security in the region.I wish  however  to remind the assembly of the unending plight of the members of the Bahai faith in Iran and the continuing deprivation of their sacred right of freedom of worship. I am informed that since the end of the forty-third session there has been a small measure of improvement in the attitude of the Iranian Government. But Bahais are still being denied the freedom to profess their religion; they are not permitted to meet as a community or to have a place of worship; their administrative institutions are banned; their properties are still being confiscated; and their holy places  sacred to the entire world-wide Bahai community  are still sequestered or are being destroyed.This continuing religious and social persecution cries out for redress and threatens the fragile peace secured by the cease-fire. The United Nations must therefore address the problem seriously and urgently if we are to avoid a return to the recent instability in that country.The Arab-Israeli conflict over the future of the Palestinians continues to be one of the major stumbling blocks in our efforts to find acceptable solutions to international disputes and to secure peace universally. But the Palestine National Council  meeting in Algiers  and the historical Geneva meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that followed it  brought new hope for a breakthrough  and it was with great expectation that we looked to 1989 for some positive movement towards a real and lasting settlement. It is therefore with some measure of disappointment that ray delegation notes that there has been no appreciable movement of the peace process and that at best the present position can only be described as being one of cautious optimism. But we nut continue our search for an acceptable solution we must not tire or falter. The stakes are too high and the consequences of failure too dangerous. We must therefore persevere to the very end.The situation in Lebanon  too  continues to be a cause for great concern. The sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of that State Member of the United Nations continues to be trampled upon by an array of military forces - some foreign  some local  aid the senseless destruction of human lives and property continues unabated. The United Nations has a duty  through this body and the Security Council  to give serious and immediate consideration to the matter with a view to finding an urgent solution to the problem and restoring peace and stability to that troubled land.In Central America  the five Presidents are tirelessly seeking to find a peaceful solution for a decade of conflict in the region. We commend them for their efforts to achieve their own negotiated settlement of the conflict  thereby fulfilling their aspirations to command respect and to exercise their independence  sovereignty and self-determination. In Panama  however  the situation has deteriorated and the people continue to be denied their God-given right to elect a Government of their choice. The strong-arm tactics of one man called the tune  to the prejudice of the vast majority of the population. The United Nations has a duty to speak out forcefully against that system and to do all that it can to help correct that situation. My delegation subscribes to the view that the implementation of the Esquipulas II Agreement offers the best hope for peace in the region. The agreement can be buttressed by the United Nations reconnaissance mission  now on the spot in the region  for the purpose of verification and monitoring of the electoral process  to be followed by repatriation and resettlement by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees of the displaced persons and families.Central to the peace process in Central America is the humanitarian request which tine five Presidents made and the General Assembly approved as the special plan of economic co-operation for Central America.Additionally  the recent International Conference on Central American Refugees  held in Guatemala City in May  signalled the good intentions in the region and in the international community for peace and national reconciliation.The social  economic and political situation in Central America and in many developing countries is aggravated by the external debt problem  which has become a millstone around the necks of brave and valiant people who are experiencing economic strangulation as a way of life.The situation in Haiti is of particular concern to ray country  as it should be to all our neighbours in the hemisphere. Haiti is the oldest black republic on the face of the earth and  except for the United States of America  it is the oldest sovereign State in this hemisphere  having attained the status in 1804. Grenada has a special affinity with Haiti because the revolutionary leader and king ofHaiti  Henri Christophe  was born in Grenada. The Government and people of Grenada are pleased to see the high-level delegation of Caribbean Foreign Ministers visit Haiti for the purpose of ascertaining first-hand information  which will aid Caribbean Community (CAR1C0M) Heads of State to offer help if so requested. My delegation hopes that there will be prompt issuance of an electoral calendar  as promised  that concrete steps will be taken to ensure free and fair lections  that there will be a smooth and easy transition to democracy  and that there will be successful co-operative management of the affairs of Haiti  which illuminated the hemisphere with revolutionary light and fervour.On every occasion for the past four years  that my delegation has addressed the subject of external debt we have advanced the idea that a more practical course must be found to bring relief to debtor countries. While the repayment of debt is the legal and moral responsibility of the debtor  debt relief  in view of the prevailing third-world economic situation  should be given humane and moral consideration by the creditors.My delegation commends those creditor nations which are beginning to exercise this consideration by either forgiving or reducing the debt obligation. Such a positive step will reduce the social and economic frustrations and hardships that threaten the very stability and security of many debtor countries. In the ease of my region  the narrow base of our economies and the specific character of our external debt  primarily to multilateral institutions  emphasize the need for programmed debt reduction. This is the only way to ensure that the necessary financial means are available for investing in our generation's future and for putting in place the necessary infrastructure upon which that future is to be built.At the forty-third session of the General Assembly I had occasion to invoke the peculiar plight of small island developing countries. It would be remiss of me not to reiterate  at this forty-fourth session  the concerns then expressed.especially in the light of the devastation that hurricane Hugo recently wrought on three sister Caribbean States  namely  Antigua and Barbuda  Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis  as well as Montserrat and other territories in the region.Indeed  at the forty-third session  in its resolution 43/189  entitle ""Specific measures in favour of island developing countries""  the General Assembly acknowledged the specificity of Member States in that category. There must  however  he effective implementation of paragraphs 10 and 11 of resolution 43/189. In fact  meaningful follow-through in the matter of ""specific measures' entails actively engaging the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  as well as various agencies of the United Nations system  at the level of financial measures  funding or operational activities. The results of the inter-agency framework to be identified by the Secretary-General must be translated into concrete action.This session of the General Assembly Is taking place on the threshold of the final decade of tills century. It would appear that a sense of urgency has entered the debate regarding the development of the developing world. Thus  during the high level segment of the thirty-sixth session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) the focus of attention was on the role of the United Nations Development programme in the 1990s. There has been a call for a special session of the General Assembly in April 1990 devoted to international economic co-operation and in particular to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of the developing countries. In yet another forum we are in the throes of formulating what is intended to be an international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade  that is  the Decade of the 1990s.My delegation sincerely hopes that the international community will face up to the challenge of addressing the issues which have been highlighted in the contextof the comprehensive policy review of operational activities of the United Nations system  under item 86 of our agenda.We in the Caribbean have been engaging in our own stock-taking so that we may be better equipped to answer to the demands and expectations of our peoples in the decade ahead. But our endogenous efforts in the area  inter alia  of human resource development  housing and human settlement  health care  agriculture and industrial development cannot be essayed in a vacuum.I now wish to reaffirm Grenada's continuing commitment to the United Nations  the organization of American States  the British Commonwealth  the Caribbean Community  the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and all other national and international organizations which assist us in achieving our foreign policy objectives  the centrepiece of which is the promotion of peace and brotherhood among members of the global community. We are guided in the pursuit of this objective by the preposition that peace and democracy are inextricably linked  and so it comports with our policy to give moral support to the people who struggle for peace and democracy.Our penchant for democracy is informed by the recent traumatic episode in our history when we took democracy for granted. On the basis of that experience  we have elected to govern and be governed by a system which  inter alia  demands and guarantees respect for the rights of the human person  provides numerous safeguards under an independent judiciary  allows freedom of expression  affords people an opportunity to participate in the political decision-making process  imposes restraints on dictators of every persuasion and tendency  and yet is capable of accommodating our very many differences and diversities.This brings me to the consideration of two issues that are potentially capable of mortgaging the future of our youth*  protection of the environment and drug trafficking and drug abuse. Both of these questions were on the agenda of the recently concluded tenth meeting of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community - a meeting which my country had the honour of hosting last July.Man's propensity to self-destruction has heretofore been the object of our concern within the ambit of international warfare. The modern-day scourges of man-propelled degradation of the environment and drug abuse and drug trafficking must be frontally attacked. We must build on the heightened consciousness of the transboundacy nature of the problems and hammer out solutions in keeping with such a focus. In this vein  Grenada fully subscribes to the precepts embodied in the Basle Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal  adopted in March 1989.It is to be noted that  at the meeting of Heads of Government alluded to earlier  we in the Caribbean endorsed proposals to combat drug trafficking submitted by Jamaica and by Trinidad and Tobago. The said proposals have now found expression in two draft resolutions to be considered at this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. They clearly envisage an active role foe the United Nations in this domain and could be viewed as furthering the objectives of theUnited Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic drugs and Psychotropic Substances  adopted in Vienna in December 1988.Last year my delegation congratulated President Reagan and President Gorbachev on their contributions to the lessening of international tensions and urged them to continue their dialogue so that the wind of change blowing over certain regions would increase in intensity and increase to encompass the whole world  bringing greater understanding and tolerance among its peoples. I now wish to congratulate President Bush for his contribution to the new spirit of detente and rapprochement and to ask him to maintain  with President Gorbachev  a level of dialogue that would enable them to achieve the trust and confidence so vital to the relaxation of international tensions. We note with satisfaction and with joy the new political climate in the Soviet Union  Poland  Hungary and Czechoslovakia and in certain parts of Central America and Africa. We note also the recent parliamentary elections in the Soviet Union and in Poland  and the emergence of a Solidarity-led Government in Poland. What a relief to see East Germans being able to cross over into West Germany without being exposed to the threat of death in the process.There can be no doubt that over the last year  we have made appreciable progress in several fields and in several regions of the world  and that we have come a long way in abating the tensions and the dangers that have so often threatened us with destruction. We must not  however  lower our guard or relax our vigilance  lest we become complacent. Let us rather be ever mindful of the continuing threat posed to the world by three international problems  the drug menace  the debt burden  and the south Africa problem  any one of which could plunge the world into darkness and despair. We must intensify our efforts in the search for new ways of dealing with these problems so we may be able to neutralize and eventually remove the dangers to world peace inherent in their continued existence.It is my belief  however  that notwithstanding the progress we might make elsewhere in the world  the world will continue to be threatened as long as the South Africa problem remains unresolved. Civilized man must never allow himself to be perceived as having accepted or acquiesced in the continuance of the beastly system of government in South Africa. The time has come when  because of its influence and prestige  the United Nations must speak out more forcefully against apartheid aid initiate the level of dialogue and the kind of action that could lead to an immediate dismantling of the system and the granting to the approximately 26 million black people of that country of the God-given right to choose their own form of government by the exercise of their franchise.Five years ago  the people of Grenada traded their rifles for the ballot box in a bold attempt to fulfil their aspirations for freedom  an inalienable feature of democratic culture. Today Grenada is at peace with itself aid at peace with democracy. The black majority of South Africa has the right to that same peace and that same democracy  and we have a duty to help them achieve them now.If we could find the courage to accept the urgent need to act together and with the necessary resolve in seeking solutions to these seemingly intractable problems  then our world might  some day during our lifetime  come to experience aid to enjoy the peace  stability and prosperity that have eluded us for so long.May God continue to shower His blessings upon us and may He also continue to guide us as we plod out weary way in search of happiness and security."
"61",2900,"GTM",44,1989,"ï»¿I come here bearing a message of friendship and solidarity from the people and the Government of Guatemala  who are taking part in the work of this session of the General Assembly imbued with the spirit which exists in this and all nations at present as they work to see  peace  to halt armed conflicts  to contribute to balanced development for our peoples  and to foster multilateral efforts to resolve the problems which affect us all. Mankind has now become a whole and the fate of each nation is inevitably tied to that of its neighbours. Every day  every year  our interdependence increases. The tendency on the part of some nations to hegemony over others is gradually giving way to the need to co-operate for the benefit of all mankind. The future of the United Nations is assured. Convinced of this  I am pleased to be able to say  Mr. Secretary-General your work has teen consonant with the spirit of times and has been carried out by you in a tireless fashion  working as you have been doing for detente  peace and general well-being. We are happy to note the success of the of your good offices  which represent a decisive contribution to reducing tensions in various parts of the world.The current session of the General Assembly will bear the responsibility to continue efforts in this titanic struggle to construct a society of international solidarity. To do so with the efficiency we know and respect  representatives may call upon the solidarity and the support of the delegation of Guatemala  which  correctly interpreting the feelings of the people of Guatemala  will always be prepared to take part in dialogue and co-ordination among peoples.I should like to recall that nearly half a century ago the end of a war was being celebrated and at that point  as peace became a necessary goal  the principles which inspired the Charter of our Organization formed the basis for a return to peaceful coexistence and civilized conduct. The people of Guatemala note with hope that the new international climate is helping to consolidate peace. We hope that peace will be a product of understanding and mutual respect and that it will not rest on force or the balance of terror. Understanding implies tolerance and it requires a recognition of the needs and difficulties we all face  together with the essential support which is necessary if those difficulties are to be overcome.We must consolidate peace  where it has been achieved  through greater understanding and accords. The abandonment of rigid political models  the consolidation of democratic processes  detente among the greater Powers - which are now discussing disarmament and international security  recognizing that they cannot split up a world that does not belong to them - the negotiation of solutions to conflicts in various parts of the world and greater dialogue with respect to common problems affecting the well-being and security of nations and problems affecting our natural environment - those are all positive developments that are changing international relations. Confrontations must become aberrations - things of the past. The new leaders of the world will be those who seek to attain peace  not those who seek to prevail over others. We can say therefore that a renewed confidence in multilateralism is emerging. The United Nations  through its organs  through its Secretary-General  is playing an active role in the efforts to put an end to confrontations in various Parts of the world and to foster discussions that might lead to resolving problems shared by all countries. The regional peace initiatives supported by international organizations have assumed an unaccustomed momentum.The new calls for peace-keeping operations are further signs of confidence in the United Nations. We welcome the fact that over the last three years four peace-keeping operations have been established  and the possibility of three more is being reviewed  including one in Central America. We hope that many other opportunities for the peaceful settlement of disputes may emerge and that the United Nations will continue its efforts to encourage and strengthen mutual confidence-building measures and other measures that increase understanding  thus preventing armed conflicts and reducing the risk of war. We agree with the Secretary-General that we must make maximum use of the United Nations capacity to set up peace-keeping operations pursuant to the Charter. We agree with the basic principles governing peace-keeping operations: a credible mandate  the full support of the Security Council  co-operation by the parties to the conflict  the willingness of Member States  including Guatemala  to contribute troops and resources  a geographically balanced and representative force  and an effective and integrated United Nations command with adequate logistical and financial support.In the disarmament field the implementation of the agreements between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the reduction of intermediate and short-range nuclear missiles has been satisfactory. We trust that this process will continue and that further practical steps can be taken in the talks on the reduction of offensive strategic weapons and those on the reduction of conventional weapons.An integral part of nuclear disarmament will be the forthcoming Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Nuclear disarmament is not a Utopian objective. All the peoples of the world consider it as necessary for their survival and for the survival of all mankind. Guatemala will continue to support the revision of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water  with a view to achieving a complete halt to such testing.We energetically reaffirm the unanimous call made by 149 States during the conference on chemical weapons held in Paris  in January of this year  for progress in the drafting of a convention on the prohibition of the development  production  storage  acquisition  transfer and use of chemical weapons together with the destruction of such devices. We note with interest the proposal made by President Bush in this respect. We feel that it is necessary to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. Disarmament is a fundamental component in the process of consolidating peace.Notwithstanding those positive trends  however  some problems represent a grave threat not only to peace but to the stability of our institutions and societies. I refer to drug trafficking  terrorism and the perverse combination of those two factors that has occurred in our continent  lb put an end to those destructive activities it will be necessary not only to have a firm political determination to combat them but also to co-ordinate joint measures in the field of security  it will also be necessary to make rapid progress in the development and codification of appropriate legal instruments. In Guatemala we have been deeply struck by the plight in which Colombia finds itself and we have expressed our solidarity with the people and the Government of that nation. We admire the decision and the determination of President Barco. We are aware that the symptoms which are causing a state of crisis in his country may be found in many of our own. That is why there mast be concerted action to deal with the problem in its various ramifications  including production  trafficking and consumption.We are prepared to participate in a crusade aimed at protecting our societies.From the outset  the democratic Government of Guatemala  over which I preside  has sought to foster coexistence among peoples  with respect for their sovereignty  the search for peace and the consolidation of democracy. We wish to share with other nations around the world the joy arising from the developments taking place in our nation in a climate of greater peace  participation and political stability.Our contribution to this international climate  characterized by greater multilateral measures  has resulted in the following principles: support for action by our multilateral organizations in Latin America and around the world and acceptance of their active presence in the settlement of political  economic and human problems; the fostering of regional organizations which pursue greater integration around common objectives - I have in mind the Central American Parliament; active participation in the promotion of dialogue  the negotiated settlement of conflicts  and co-ordination for the establishment of consensus  as in the case of the peace plan known as Esguipulas II .Furthermore  we support initiatives towards greater North-South dialogue. The social and political problems of balanced economic development should not be regarded as separate* they are the responsibility of the international community. I sincerely believe that this work and that of promoting co-ordinated action to protect the climate of our nation and of Central America represent a historic contribution to the future of mankind.In that connection  domestically we have assumed the responsibility of fostering the development of our economy  making proper effective use of our own resources  channelling development inwards in order gradually to pay off a debt to society accumulated over the years and create more equitable living conditions for all the inhabitants of our nation.We wish to reach the year 2000 on track for develops. But we know that the success of out measures of our measures requires adequate external  conditions that have not exists over the past decade. Indebtedness and debt-servicing  and the reduction of financial resources for development are problem that continue to affect us. We can understand the problems that are affecting the developed countries  but their protectionist measures  the general proliferation of discriminator  practices notwithstanding trade principles and practices that have previously been encouraged trade restrictions applied to exports fro. developing countries  monetary and financial instability  and high interest rates - to mention only a few problems - are all causing us a great deal of difficulty as we work to carry out the task we have set for ourselves. The United Nations bears a fundamental responsibility for fostering social progress and the attainment of better living standards for all the peoples of the world. In order to fulfil that responsibility effectively  the spirit of co-operation that has arisen in the politics! sphere must now extend to the economic and social spheres. It must be pointed out that progress made in the political climate can be consolidated only if we correct the economic climate that has been detrimental to most of the world's population. We believe that multilateralism  which has been an effective instruct in the promotion of peace  must be used to rebuild international economic relations. The United Nations offers a suitable framework for resuming broad-based North-South dialogue on international economic cooperation. The special session of the General Assembly scheduled for next year represents an opportunity for such dialogue. For our part  we are prepared to take an active part in that process.Guatemala is ready to promote develop without Jeopardies  our ecology and the well-being of the future generations of our country and of all mankind. That is why we must express our deepest concern at the deterioration of the environment. Today  we cannot disregard the cataclysmic risks of climate change and other consequences of damage to the environment. All countries  from the most industrialized nations to the least developed countries  recognize the gravity of the problem and the urgent need to find practical solutions. The responsibility must of course be shared by all as regards measures to be taken. We feel it is important to emphasize  however  the primary responsibility borne by the industrialized countries as regards controlling and repairing damage caused to the environment  and their obligation to assist the developing countries in achieving environmentally sound and sustainable development.The Central American Presidents  inspired by genuine concern  have established a Central American commission for the environment and development. I consider that the international community must step up its efforts and contribute to the protection of the tropical jungles in our region. It is necessary to avoid the consequences arising from their destruction and to secure additional financial resources to protect such areas.In a further effort in the search for appropriate solutions to economic and social development  five countries of the Central American region held a conference in October of last year  at which we agreed to promote the establishment of the ""Mayan Trail""  a large-scale enterprise which must be declared as a common heritage of mankind  it is consistent with the guidelines of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization.The project is directly linked to the preservation of the environment  tropical forests  and their flora and fauna. Its aim is to encourage ecological tourism and to create sustained  non-destructive development that will not harm the environment and can generate employment and financial resources on a scale sufficient to preserve such areas  if the project is to become a reality  we need understanding and international co-operation. We need the determination to preserve the natural environment and to protect our indigenous communities of Mayan descent. The preservation of the environment is a legitimate concern of all  developed and developing alike  as is the elimination of poverty. Environmentally sound development must stress the elimination of poverty and the reduction of human suffering.We do not desire economic development to the detriment of our neighbours. We desire political stability and a firm lasting peace that will benefit us all and permit co-existence  we wish to strengthen mutual trust among our nations and to fester a collective approach to our problems. We know that our policy of active neutrality makes us a factor of equilibrium necessary for peace  peace we wish to be permanent. But we are certain peace can endure only with the support of the international community  Our Central American societies have gone through the most difficult and bloody periods of our history  but we have a common destiny and we must return to the path of concord and peaceful coexistence.Our house has been destroyed  and we wish to rebuild it on more stable foundations  strengthening the ties that bind us. In Central America we have been examining  discussing  and agreeing upon steps to achieve peace  development and well-being for our people.. We are rebuilding our house on democratic foundations through the exercise of our right to self determination and a future of peace and development. We wish to strive to teach our peoples to live democratically. We wish to ensure the right of all human beings to freedom of thought. But it is necessary to learn to live in peace  to set our weapons aside and to work together. Let us work together to turn Central America into a great nation. We must co-operate to find a solution to our economic and social problems  to provide our children with a decent  dignified life  we must eradicate poverty  adjust income and the distribution of wealth. We need education to improve our housing  clothing  health and food.Since the Esquipulas meeting held in August 1987 Central American presidents have worked to bring peace to the region and have striven to fulfil the Esquipulas accords. In the course of this year we held two meetings which adopted new verification and monitoring decisions  as well as decisions with respect to the demobilization of certain irregular forces. We entrusted the Secretaries-General of the united Nations and the Organization of American States to implement the joint plan for the demobilization  repatriation or voluntary resettlement of members of the Nicaraguan resistance and their relatives. We have undertaken to facilitate the implementation of that plan  and we appreciate the international co-operation and humanitarian assistance to that end.  I would re-emphasize what was stated in this Assembly two years ago: that in our quest for peace and democracy in Central America the agreements reached by presidents in the region are not a reference point for discussion or rejection  but rather a starting point for finding solutions. Those agreements represent what we wish to see  and it is within the framework of those agreements  if they arerespected  that discussions to attain a firm and lasting peace in Central America will be achieved.We hope that the Security Council will  in due course  authorize the setting up of a visiting observer mission as well as other requirements of the Secretary-General to support the demobilization of irregular forces. These steps  which represent a new stage in the development of the peace process in our region will contribute to consolidating the positive results of our efforts.In El Salvador and Nicaragua  there are encouraging signs of progress towards national reconciliation  we welcome that progress and hope it will continue. Serious talks designed to achieve a cessation of hostilities have begun in El Salvador as a first step towards substantive political negotiations to  strengthen democracy. In Nicaragua a significant political event is being prepared that could represent the start of a fresh stage in the political life of that sister country  if the electoral conditions are consistent with the principles and commitments made in the presidential accords. We hope that the electoral observer mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States will not merely verify the existence of such conditions but will also help to suggest ways of improving them.Aware of the historic responsibility to face up to one of the problems that afflict us most we held an international conference on Central American refugees. Its basic purpose was a humanitarian one: to find a lasting  stable solution to the problem  whereby it would become possible to voluntarily repatriate and resettle in their place of origin thousands of refugees and displaced persons now housed in our countries. Essentially  we lack the financial and economic resources for this but there is the will and the commitment to find a permanent solution. Each Central American has the right to live in his country of origin and must be taken in and assisted.The General Assembly has adopted the Special Plan for Economic Co-operation for Central America  and we welcome the efforts that have been made to implement it. we also took part in the first meeting between Central American Governments and the co-operating Governments and institutions. We hope that the meeting will bear fruit and strengthen economic and technical cooperation with Central America.The Guatemalan Government is seriously concerned that the situation in Panama could threaten the general situation in the region. With other democratic nations we stand behind the Panamanian people in its determination to overcome these difficulties by peaceful means and to satisfy its aspiration to live in democracy.  We reiterate the pressing need for us to channel our efforts into the restoration of institutional democracy  taking into account the spirit and aspirations of Latin Americans  while adopting an attitude of collective responsibility and accepting the initiatives to find peaceful solutions to the aspirations of the Panamanians.With respect to Belize  we are prepared to work for a just  comprehensive and honourable peaceful settlement between the parties concerned. I would remind the assembly that my Government initiated direct talks in a realistic and constructive fashion with representatives of Belize who visited Guatemala to take part in important international events. Nevertheless  if our efforts are to bear fruit  here must be a realistic  flexible and positive attitude shared by both parties.Guatemala has gone through one of the longest periods of peace  stability and social development in its history. The climate of freedom and participation became clear with the unprecedented growth  during the last 40 years of our history  of political  social and economic organizations which are fostering popular participation in the great decisions of the nation. Democracy in Guatemala is being constructed with the active participation of all sectors of society  but there are minority groups that are opposed to the consolidating of our endeavours. Since institutional development and our operating capacity still limit our possibility to guarantee the full measure of security due all our citizens and to have total control over those groups which are part of a past we would forget. People welcomes and appreciates the assistance and advice of the international community. Our practical progress with respect to human rights and the establishment of the rule of law in our nation has been accepted by all  but we so know that much still remains to be done.The support and confidence of our friends and of the international community as represented in this Organization will help us to make progress in this respect  and to consolidate our democracy which was and will be available to construct the society of international solidarity which we wish to bring about. As one of the principal purposes of the United Nations  the task of fostering respect for human rights is a matter of legitimate international concern. Guatemala considers that United Nations efforts in this respect have been effective and we support the Secretary-General in his initiative to strengthen the Organization's role in providing advice and technical assistance to guarantee the protection of human rights.Guatemala has benefited from that programme and appreciates the help received from the advisers assigned to our country. The United Nations has made an undeniable contribution to emphasizing the natural relationship between peace  justice  freedom  development and human rights. For this reason we joined in the energetic condemnation of any massive violation of such basic guarantees of the political development and freedom of peoples.  Guatemala vehemently condemns the shameful apartheid system  a flagrant violation of human rights. It is unconscionable that  despite two decades of United Nations struggle against racism and discrimination  this irrational practice should stubbornly persist.RHOur principles lead us to feel an active part of the international community. Guatemala has followed with concern the various diplomatic endeavours in the Middle East  we recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence on their own territory  which will not jeopardize the existence of the state of Israel within boundaries recognized by the United Nations. We supported the initiative to convene an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations.  Guatemala hopes that both in Afghanistan and in Cambodia the efforts to achieve a comprehensive political solution will continue. These must guarantee the independence and self-determination of the peoples in question. Above and beyond the withdrawal of foreign troops  we feel that a political settlement must be encouraged  and that there must be no activities incompatible with the principles contained in the United Nations Charter.The attainment of independence by Namibia has over the years been one of the major concerns of the United Nations. Guatemala supports Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the plan for the independence of Namibia within the whole of its recognized territory. We applaud what is being done by the Secretary-General and the staff of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG). We are following with the greatest interest the preparations being made to hold free and fair elections under United Nations supervision and control. We energetically appeal to all parties  particularly South Africa  to co-operate fully With UNTAG  respecting their obligations at all times and fully complying with the agreements and understandings to which they have subscribed. I have referred in general terms to the matters which require urgent solution. I would end by reaffirming our faith and trust in the United Nations and in the capacity of the Secretary-General and of the present President of the General Assembly to continue to foster dialogue among nations  in order to fulfil our greatest aspirations: the establishment of a pluralistic society that can live in peace and harmony and ensure for the individual a decent  fitting life and the exercise of his fundamental rights and freedoms."
"62",2944,"GUY",44,1989,"ï»¿ We are meeting at a time when the dynamic of co-operation has gained ascendancy over that of confrontation. As a result a good mood prevails in the international environment. It has engendered perceptible improvement in international relations and anticipates the ushering in of an order of global peace and equitable development in which the United Nations would have a central role. That is why this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  convened as it is at such a hopeful juncture  is expected to promote the expansion of global co-operation in what should be a global endeavour to build a new and better world. Guyana is confident that under your able guidance  Mr. President  that expectation will be met. I therefore wish to extend to you my warmest congratulations and my best wishes for a successful presidency. In your personage as a distinguished son of Nigeria and of Africa reside all the qualities and virtues essential to such a high office.I take this opportunity to pay tribute also to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the inspiring leadership that he so ably provided. As we review the evolution of international relations as we approach the end of the 198Å°S  it should be acknowledged that there have been positive developments in to search for an international order that yields equitable benefits to all members of the global society.	International tension has eased remarkably  dialogue and negotiation have given impetus to conflict resolution and bloc rivalries have noticeably diminished. Regional co-operation has become a global process  and changes of a far-reaching nature are being made within societies and in relations between-them. The retreat of colonialism is accelerating and in the expression of renewed faith in multilateralism there is Increasing recourse to the United Nations as a universal organization capable of being used effectively by its members in fulfilment of peoples aspirations which transcend national boundaries. In the economic field too changes are far-reaching and beneficial nature are taking place  though these are not yet as pervasive. These major trends and tendencies give us hope for the future. It is the case  however  that old problems to Which solutions have not so far been found persist and new issues have arisen posing new challenges. Solutions to these problems can be achieved only through openness and transparency requiring genuine international co-operation  for the issues are of Ð» global character. Here I refer to questions such as the environment and drugs.In considering the myriad items on the international agenda  I suggest that we are helped by what is a more widespread appreciation of the current complexities and requirements which interdependence has generated. Today  interdependence is not merely a fashionable slogan its consequence has made global action an urgent imperative. Nowhere is this reality more patent than in the struggle for disarmament  especially in respect of nuclear weapons. Happily  this process has at last begun. By signing the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have demonstrated a commendable willingness to reduce their nuclear arsenals; and they are engaged in ongoing discussions on limiting strategic offensive weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.It is good to note as well that the question of conventional arms  beyond the level of sufficiency for national defence  is being increasingly addressed. This development should be encouraged at both the national and the international levels. I include the national dimension because it is unfortunately the case that conventional weapons have become a regular commodity of international trade.Success can attend the international efforts in this area only if there is restraint in terms of both acquisition and production. Equally  our concern should be heightened by the dangers which rapid advances in the technology of weapons brigs. More generally  since the threat of the arms race affects the lives of all peoples  disarmament cannot be pursued on the basis of exclusivity. As the Secretary-General observed  ... the United Nations should continue to be at the forefront of multilateral efforts in this field . (A/44/1  p. 15)The proper use of United Nations machinery in this regard is an indispensable requirement.Detente between the super-Powers has had the beneficial effect of easing international tensions. This development has contributed to the emergence of an  environment in which the indigenous efforts of regional States to resolve their problems have been assisted. For it is that in all regions where conflicts exist the intrusion of external interests has complicated the search for a solution. It is the happy circumstance therefore that we can today witness in such conflict areas as Afghanistan  Central America  Iraq and Iran  and southern Africa that the conjuncture of super-Power detente and regional and other efforts have led to dialogue and negotiation for the solution to those conflicts and to fresh hopes for the settlement of disputes which at one time seemed intractable. In all these situations the United Nations has played an important and significant role. The process of settlement is  however  as yet incomplete.The delicately negotiated peace agreements as regards Afghanistan should be scrupulously implemented so as not to jeopardize a political solution. In Central America  where the Esquipulas agreements and more lately the Tela agreement have paved the way to peace  the regional States roust be supported and their efforts brought to consummation. Iran and Iraq  which have agreed to a cease-fire  should both be urged towards reconciliation and the restoration of good relations. In Cyprus  it is regrettable that the intercommunal talks have not progressed as the international community would have wished. Vie urge all parties concerned to react favourably to the reasonable proposals advanced by the Secretary-General.In Kampuchea  where war  destruction and suffering have prevailed for much too long  it is to be hoped that the States concerned will revive the Paris Conference in a determined attempt to find common ground. In Korea  where the North and South remain divided  the international community should provide greater stimulus towards their peaceful reunification  without outside interference.In Western Sahara  where there are signs of progress in implementing the peace plan proposed by the Secretary -General and the Chair an of the Organization of African unity (OAU)  we must urge the parties to co-operate folly in the endeavour to settle this protracted dispute.Namibia  of course  has a unique relationship with the United Nations  which after all is the legal Administering Authority. Its freedom has for too long been denied by the intransigent Pretoria regime  few  however  Namibia appears to be on the threshold of regaining that freedom. The special responsibility the Organization bears imposes on it the need for it to be even more vigilant as the process nears its conclusion. We should brook no subterfuge or machination by South Africa to frustrate the exercise by the Namibian people of all their political rights and ensure that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is implemented in all its provisions. Guyana is numbered among those countries that have contributed human resources to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (IWTAG) operations that are intended to secure that result  we therefore look forward to welcoming an Independent Namibia to the Organization.Namibia  the prospect for the end of apartheid - which is Inevitable - is not as clearly discernible in time. Nevertheless the shattering of the myth of the regime's military invincibility  taken in conjunction with the pressure exerted by the liberation movements and by the international community  and the contradictions inherent in the system of apartheid  render its sustainability increasingly difficult. Changes in keeping with the people's democratic aspirations must come. It is a matter of time. Meanwhile  it is necessary to intensify international pressure for such change. Sanctions must be maintained  tightened and expanded and succour and encouragement give to the oppressed people of that troubled land. There should be no relenting until apartheid is totally dismantled.The Palestinians are yet another people deprived of their fundamental rights. Scattered throughout the world in a painful Diaspora they suffer the indignity of a people deprived of a homeland. The intifadah graphically portrays the consequences of the suppression of a people and at the same time their unshakable resolve to regain their freedom. The requirements for Q solution have long been prescribed. What has been absent is the determination of all members of the international community  and one or other of the parties concerned  boldly to take the necessary steps. The international conference on the Middle East called for by the United Nations could  if pursued with patience and with seriousness  lead to a durable and lasting negotiated settlement.The current mood is not unpropitious to collective efforts aimed at solving the problems to which I have made reference. Let us seize the opportunity. Even as we do so  however  it is necessary to pay due attention to new issues that are global in scope.The first of these is the environment. Even though the question of the human environment was first addressed in a global context at the world conference in Stockholm in 1972 it is only in recent times that the international community has been acutely sensitised to the dangers which its persistent degradation holds foe the future of mankind. It is apposite  I believe  to recall that in Stockholm the principles agreed for international co-operative action included respect for the sovereignty of States and the requirement that concern for the environment should enhance  not adversely affect  the prospects for growth of the economies of the developing countries. It was also agreed then that the international community should adopt appropriate measures to promote the legitimate interests of the developing countries in economic development. Present concern should respect those principles.It is true that since 1972 further degradation of the environment has taken place  thus adding urgency to the need to adopt appropriate measures to halt and reverse this trend. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other international  id national bodies have devised helpful programmes in this respect. Yet there is a danger that unless the issue is addressed in a structured manner and without a zeal born of irrationality in e desired international co-operation could be made to succumb to prejudiced attitudes and unfair practices. In this regard  1 speak as the representative of an Amazonian country  cognizant of the fact that some current positions on the utilization of the tropical rain forests  if maintained  could lead to unwanted delay in building a global consensus on the way forward.Guyana is of the view that the present situation requires an approach which is based on true partnership and in which the sharing of burdens takes account of both differential capacities and past excesses. It has been stated  for example  that the tropical rain forests are a storehouse of bio-diversity which can be utilised for the benefit of all mankind. Yet it is a sad fact that those of us who own those forests end are being prevailed upon in one form or another to preserve them have rarely benefited from their exploitation as a game bank  except as consumers of other peoples' products. In tills regard it is imperative so to construct new arrangements as to enable the benefits of ownership to be at least equal to those of discovery. 1 accordingly call upon the United Nations and appropriate agencies to take action in order to make this a reality.Happily as regards the second issue - that of drugs - there is increasing recognition that it can be dealt with adequately only if all dimensions of the problems are addressed with vigour. I refer to production# trafficking and consumption. It is good to note that within recent times action has been strengthened nationally and internationally. Guyana supports the initiatives taken by our sister Caribbean nations Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago deal with some facets of this terrifying problem. Ch this issue we can only move forward together. Aiming to international economic relations  it cannot be sand that the global economy is in good shape when assessed for its overall quality and against the backdrop of the well-being of mankind. It is true that world output continues to expand# and current evidence suggests that this trend will not be reversed. There are even claims that the world is on the threshold of a new era of prosperity. However  despite the many positive characteristics# the continuous amplification of the international economy has not always been vigorous. An m even pattern of growth has been experienced and this has not helped to revitalize the battered economies of some developing countries  although strenuous national adjustment efforts to achieve the relief promised by the expansion have been made.After nearly a decade of the search for a satisfactory solution  debt continues to preside over the economic fortunes of many a developing country. Instead of being net recipients of financial flows capable of energizing their economies  the disadvantaged nations have become involuntary sources of finance for developed countries. Trade is always an imperative for growth. Yet the opportunities in that area have frequently been thwarted by the continuing resort to protectionism. The chance to produce positive results is greatly handicapped by the harsh conditions pertaining to commodities of export value to developing countries.The world is highly competitive and efficiency and quality are paramount considerations. In such circumstances  increasing the possibilities for sustained growth demands that account be taken of the lagging technological capability of developing countries and the inadequacy of human resource development in the evolution of the world economy.A significant feature of this decade is the extent to which the major industrialized countries have Increased their policy co-ordination on economic matters. Such action has brought success in the control of inflation  yet concern persists at all levels about the impact of large imbalances among industrialized countries and Instability of their exchange and interest rates on the future outlook for everyone.It is against the background of such unsatisfactory conditions  in which hunger  malnutrition and preventable disease produce unacceptable numbers of casualties  that we assess the global economy. These economic and social problems must be overcome if developing countries are to cope with their current adversity and succeed in contributing to higher levels of sustained growth and development. Diminishing living standards and the widening gap between north and Southern counter to other efforts to increase peace and security and protect the environment.The return to prosperity will not come about easily. Yet  as we survey the economic panorama  we observe a steady improvement in economic relations among States that gives rise to a new sense of possibilities in international co-operation. Such progress involves changes of both an international and a domestic character. They ate not only institutional but also issue-related. The progress is reflected in the intensification of integration processes in many regions of the world and the establishment of trade agreements. Over the last four years the countries of the Caribbean Community have sought vigorously to advance this process. Curing those years major decisions have been taken to develop the Community as a single economy. The latest measures are contained in the declaration  adopted by the Heads of Government of that Community when they met in July this year in Grenada. The Community  which is bound together by a perception of common destiny  has become more cohesive and its members more mutually supportive. The response of the States  d people of the Community to the devastation wrought open several island territories by hurricane Hugo is eloquent to money to the sense of fraternity that exists.Their limitations notwithstanding  the recent proposals on debt have contributed to a gradual evolution of the debt strategy and create the hope that the problem could eventually be resolved. In this respect there is a need to move forward faster on debt reduction  id to extend its application as widely as necessary. At the same time  it is essential to ensure that the positive effects of debt reduction are not blunted by the unavailability of sources.  The changes in these economic relation are evident in the shifts in the perception of  and the approach taken by the major multilateral institutions to  the problems of developing countries. M important development is the involvement of the International Monetary fund (IMF) in providing financial support for debt and debt-service reduction in line with more recent efforts to respond to this crisis. Additionally  with a growing number of low-income countries suffering economic setbacks  the 3MF has adapted its policies regarding the use by these countries of its structural adjustment facility. Moreover  it has created the enhanced structural adjustment facility  the terms of which have been adjusted to allow many beneficiary countries to draw on its resources in  we hope  a timely fashion. Multilateral trade negotiations are in progress under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (ATT)  Gradual progress is being made  and until the discussions are completed the possibility remains open that a fairer and better trading system will be created. But such a possibility will be diminished if sincere efforts are not made to fulfil commitments on standstill and roll-back provisions that are vital to the growth of third-world trade. At the same time  more countries are making efforts to restore the international economy.  Through all those measures  we can turn adversity into triumph for global development. It can be broadened by expanding the limits of co-operation to encompass suitable international policy action in all important areas of concern  including those of commodities and human resource development.Our responsibility is clear. Together we must act to arrest the economic decline of developing countries. Interdependence and the quest for global harmony impose that responsibility on us. The special session of the United Nations General Assembly to be held in April next year  id the process of elaborating a new international development strategy are Important opportunities for pursuing those goals.Our action should also reflect the urgency of the situation. The framework for action must always be that which offers the most efficient means of co-operation. Whether it be bilateral  multilateral or economic and technical co-operation among developing countries  Guyana stands ready to play its part in our joint endeavours.It is most fitting that the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of developing countries  will be taking place at a time when the prestige of the United Nations has been restored. The Organization has begun again to assert its prime responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security. In this respect the Security Council has met constantly to review developments and to exercise its authority as the guarantor of world peace.Much of the credit for those developments is due to the Secretary-General  Mr. Peres de Cuellar  who has co-operated fully with Member States in the many initiatives taken to secure stability and progress in the international  political and economic system. His admirable annual report reflects the valuable work done this year to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations  and points with clarity to some steps which should be taken to achieve that result.Over the years a sizeable corpus of Ideas has developed with an eye to improving the machinery of the United Nations. It is Guyana's hope that these ideas can be fully examined and implemented to the benefit of our Organization and its operations.The tendency towards attitudinal changes bodes well for the future of the United Nations and should  if pursued  enable it to realize its full potential. Now Is the time to deepen this new-found faith in the United Nations so that it can proceed to expand the frontlets of achievement.Clearly  new demands will be made on the Organization precisely as a result of the successes it has already scored. There will be  for example  a role entrusted to the United Nations to guarantee the scrupulous implementation of accords reached on the settlement of conflicts. If we are dilatory  the newly found prestige of the Organization will evaporate and leave the world once again prey to unwanted adventurism.It is also important  as noted by the Secretary-General  that early preventive diplomacy should be more readily utilized  as it has distinct advantages over curative measures  which are often late  costly and less effective. At the beginning of this decade of peace and international law therefore  let us resolve fully to explore the advantage of resolving conflicts by political and legal means rather than by the threat or use of force. Let us also resolve to make more use of the International Court of Justice in the cause of peace.At the apogee of success the United Nations is ideally poised to launch a major offensive against the legion of problems which continue to besiege the world. Their solution requires the conflation of the interests of all Member States# developed and developing alike.Let us at this session raise the banner of unity and co-operation# and from now on work towards the installation of a regime of durable peace and prosperity."
"63",2989,"HND",44,1989,"ï»¿I feel very honoured to be here once again to speak to the General Assembly on behalf of the Government of President Jose Azcona.I should like to begin my statement by extending to you  Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. I am certain that your abilities and your experience will be decisive in ensuring the success of our deliberations. Forty-five years ago my country came to the city of San Francisco to sign the United Nations Charter  convinced that the new Organization would play a major role of maintaining international peace and security and ensuring respect for human rights and the promotion of individual and collective progress.As time has gone by  our faith in the Organization not only has survived intact but has grown because of its achievements. I need only recall the extremely important work done by the United Nations in the field of decolonisation and in promoting the codification of international law  as well as the efforts to ensure better standards of living for mankind.But it is in the area of the maintenance of peace that the major efforts of our Organization have been most obvious. This work has been made possible by the concerted 'action of Member States and the most commendable activities of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. It has also been facilitated by the new climate of relaxation of tension which seems to prevail in the world. Today  the Government of Honduras again expresses its belief in the United Nations and repeats its commitment to the purposes and principles of the Organization  convinced that it will continue to play a crucial role in the attainment of our common goals.For many years mankind has been divided by ideological confrontations deriving from the cold war - the most obvious example of the conflict between East and West. Furthermore  in addition to the real threat of open confrontation between the super-Powers  there have been many localized conflicts in various parts of the world.Against this disturbing backdrop  we have seen with concern how vast economic resources have been spent on a ruinous arms race. And yet the new climate of detente augurs well for a fundamental change in international relations that could bring the end of such struggles. The coming to power of a new generation of politicians in the Soviet Union has opened up prospects of major changes occurring in that country as well as other countries of Eastern Europe.In fact the pragmatism demonstrated by that new leadership is changing the attitude of some Marxist Governments which now seem to be searching in the Western world for the authentic values of freedom and democracy  including economic concepts which not too long ago were being rejected by those regimes.There is no doubt that respect for the human rights and political and social freedoms of the individual is the sine qua non for the material progress of mankind. Consequently  concerted international efforts must be intensified in order to ensure such respect.Today the major features of democracy - such as free elections  freedom of expression and the right to organize political parties - are developing more fully in various parts of the world to a greater or lesser degree. We have witnessed the demolition of some of the ideological walls built in the past which represented an effort to protect a political system that had proved inoperative because it was unable to provide the citizens with the rights that it supposedly upheld.In view of those political changes it is difficult to understand how in some countries of the world there can still exist Governments attempting to impose - by force of arms in many cases - and to export regimes based on doctrines and ideologies which have been recognized as not viable by those who used to advocate them.The changes taking place in several Eastern countries may well contribute to peace in the world. Encouraging such changes and their consolidation and extension is in the interests of mankind as a whole. In this context  perestroika is welcome. Last year when we addressed the Assembly  we said how pleased we were at what had been done in obtaining peaceful negotiated solutions to some of the most difficult and bloodiest conflicts. We mentioned inter alia the end of hostilities between Iran and Iraq and the progress achieved in the negotiations for Namibian independence and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Namibia! territory. We would also like to see the end of the odious policy of apartheid. We welcome the return to their country of origin of the foreign troops that were in Afghanistan  an indispensable step for national reconciliation and effective self-determination for the Afghan people.We are also pleased at the decision reached by the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to begin contacts which  we hope  will lead to a solution of their dispute in relation to the Malvinas.The situation in the Middle East continues to be a focus of international tension. Although the Camp David agreements gave us hope for movement towards peace  unfortunately there has been no expansion of dialogue in the area. There is the possibility of a properly structured international peace conference on the Middle East  and such a conference might well be the key to the solution of this conflict. My Government wishes to associate itself with the concern expressed by His Holiness  pope John Paul II in regard to the most distressing events in Lebanon. The world is powerless before the violent and continued destruction of that country  which was once an example of peaceful coexistence among communities with different religions. My Government is ready to support any resolution that could bring an end to that heart-breaking tragedy.In early June the whole world watched stupefied at how the Government of the People's Republic of China responded to a peaceful student demonstration with violent repressive measures. The bloody events of Tiananmen Square  followed by executions and incarcerations  deserve universal condemnation.It has been the practice at the United Nations that the right to self-determination referred fundamentally to peoples under colonial rule. That right  however  is in no way limited to those peoples  nor is it circumscribed to a given political situation which is now vanishing. Indeed  when the right to self-determination is invoked  emphasis is put on the ability of all people freely to choose the type or form of Government they deem best for themselves.The basic concept is therefore free choice which  as set forth in resolution 1541 (XV) adopted by the General Assembly in 1960  must be carried out""... through informed and democratic processes  impartially conducted and based on universal adult suffrage. The United Nations could  when it deems it necessary  supervise these processes."" (resolution 1541 (XV)  principle IX) In the light of that principle  each State is bound internally to guarantee to its own people the exercise of the right to self-determination. Paradoxically  we frequently see how this right is violated through a twisted interpretation in order to crush the popular will. In this context I wish to mention that at the twenty-first consultative meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American continent I stated our concern over the serious irregularities that occurred in the elections in the Republic of Panama  which led to a disregard of the popular will expressed in the ballot boxes and to the establishment of a de facto government in that country. We again express the hope that the International Conference in Paris on the question of Cambodia will mark the beginning of a dialogue that can lay the bases for a just and lasting settlement of that conflict. The people of Cambodia must be enabled  without foreign intervention  and as soon possible  to determine their own fate.On the question of Western Sahara  my Government supports the resolutions of the General Assembly calling for a referendum that will permit the people of that country to decide what future is best for them.On the Korean question  my country advocates  and would encourage  negotiations between South Korea and North Korea towards a peaceful solution of their differences. In accordance with the principle of the universality of the United Nations  we reaffirm our belief that all nations that subscribe to the principles of the San Francisco Charter should be able to become part of the United Nations family should they so desire. In particular  we support the Republic of Korea in its wish to join.On the situation in Central America  to which I shall refer later in greater detail  I want to point to the significant developments in the efforts to solve the crisis. The summit meeting held by the Central American Presidents in Tela  Honduras? concluded with the signing of major agreements  whose implementation will guarantee the process of normalisation in Central America.Today  more than ever before  mankind is aware of the serious challenge posed by illegal drug trafficking and its consequences. A few years ago  in another international forum  the delegation of Honduras spoke about the dangerous link between political terrorism and drug traffickers. We said: ""typifying the abhorrent phenomenon called narco-terrorism  that inexorable enemy of youth in particular and of mankind in general  is that it tends to destroy  bit by bit  the physical and moral integrity of our peoples in order to reach its treacherous goals. The promoters of this vile business own sophisticated equipment and machinery; they have international contacts and a strong defence apparatus which enables them to confront their respective Governments and authorities. Our Organization cannot remain aloof from these repugnant actions  and must take initiatives not only to condemn them firmly but to make available to Member States the legal instruments necessary for the prevention and punishment of such crimes.""Drug trafficking must be attacked in all its aspects. Production and processing facilities must be destroyed  and demand and use must be eliminated or at least reduced. If that is achieved  the countries serving as bridges  which  owing to their geographical location  are usually the real victims  will be cut out of the crime routes  thus putting a stop to the enormous illicit profits from money laundering  which can have a dangerous influence on States at different levels of the power structure.In this connection  we welcome the initiatives of the President of the United States of America and other Heads of State to fight this problem through a programme to reduce drug use and to assist other Governments to stop drug production and trafficking. My Government again states its determination to do its utmost to contribute to the eradication of this scourge. We express our solidarity with the President  Mr. Virgilio Barco Vargas  and Government of Colombia in their efforts.Last year the General Assembly adopted resolution 42/169  which established the international decade for natural disaster reduction. My country  conscious of the enormous material and human losses caused by such disasters throughout the world  was one of the sponsors of that resolution. In this connection  one is reminded of the hurricane Hugo  which recently devastated various Caribbean States and part of the American mainland.It is clear that concerted international action can encourage the adoption of measures to reduce the damage done by natural disasters. For such action to succeed  however  it is necessary to strengthen civil-defence structures and institutions charged with study  prevention  assistance and rehabilitation.I take this opportunity to restate my Government's recognition of the efforts of the United Nations in the field of international co-operation. In this connection  the work of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) should be singled out.The difficult economic situation faced by Central American countries - including  of course  Honduras - has worsened because of the drop in the prices of traditional export products  the burden of servicing foreign debt  and increased protectionism in various parts of the world. In addition  political tension and conflicts affecting the Central American isthmus in the last decade have discouraged foreign investment and tourism. I feel that this situation cannot be solved unless the Central American States take joint action  with support from the international community. The agreements signed by the Presidents of the Central American countries to put an end to the crisis in the area and the welcome they have received have resulted in important international initiatives.The launching of the Special Plan of Economic Co-operation for Central America is the result of concerted action by the international community. It supports commitments by the Central American countries themselves to try to improve the standard of living of their peoples and to achieve social justice as the foundation for firm and lasting peace. My Government has participated actively with other Governments in the region in work related to the launching of the Special Plan of Economic Co-operation for Central America  which is being carried out under the auspices of UftDF. We hope that that forum can be used as an additional means of dialogue to channel the necessary resources for promoting development  strengthening the democratisation process  and ensuring peace.In the context of Central America  I should remind the General Assembly that Honduras has to provide temporary shelter for the very large number of people immigrating irregularly because of violence in other countries in the area. More than 60 per cent of the national territory is covered by forest  and  already  almost all the fertile agricultural areas are taken up. The demographic pressure of this enormous illegal immigration  which accounts now for 10 per cent of the entire Honduran population  has contributed greatly to the establishment of a slope-type agriculture that has led to a deterioration in our environment; and catastrophic effects over the medium and long terms are to be expected unless measures are taken to control this migration. Conservation and re-establishment of the ecological balance are an absolute priority for the survival of mankind.	At the international meeting on Central American refugees  held in Guatemala late in May this year  the Government of Honduras set forth the following criteria underlying its refugee policy. The problem of refugees in the area is and must be a temporary one. The refugee phenomenon is political in nature. This implies that its solution will be possible only if political and social conditions are created which can encourage and facilitate the return of refugees to their countries of origin. For this to be feasible  the international community must encourage measures to strengthen normal institutions guaranteeing the rule of law and peace in all countries in the area. We believe that international assistance to resolve this problem must be provided in proportion to the sacrifices made by countries that have taken in refugees  and the efforts by the countries of origin to expedite the repatriation of their citizens and nationals. Until voluntary repatriation actually occurs  Honduras will guarantee the security of refugees in the country  subject to total respect for its sovereignty  the security of its own population and the application of its legal regime. We feel that Honduras has been forced to pay too high a price for the violence occurring in neighbouring countries  as we took in flews of refugees in numbers far beyond our nation's capacity.It is time for those countries that have generated the refugee flows to assume the responsibility of solving their own domestic problems  so that the necessary conditions may be established for their citizens to return home. For the decisions of the International Conference on Central American Refugees to take effect  along with the meeting on donations this past July in Geneva  within the framework of the Special Programme for Central America  it is essential that the international community lend its political and financial support to the work being done by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. My Government would restate its position on the urgent need to find a prompt and reasonable solution to the foreign debt problem of the developing countries. The weight of debt-servicing slows down development  and it is a serious obstacle to the implementation of democratic objectives. In this respect  we agree with what was said by the Council of Ministers of the European Community  which last June in Madrid stated:""A solution of this problem  particularly in Latin America  is of major importance to the consolidation and strengthening of democracy."" It may seem rather odd  but our developing countries have found greater receptivity and understanding in respect of their foreign debt problems from some of the private banks  while the international development institutions and organizations  of which we are founding members  continue to try to impose on us outdated formulas which have already created explosive situations in several countries.During the current decade  the Central American isthmus has faced unprecedented events. The unleashing of violence in some countries of the region has led to consequences that have gone far beyond their political borders and affected the area as a whole. The instability resulting from this situation end the inclusion of the Central American crisis in the agenda of East-West confrontation  and the deterioration of the economic  political and social situation in the area  have made us aware of the great need to find a joint answer to this new situation. In spite of existing ideological differences  the Governments in the region  from the early part of this decade  began a very complex political dialogue  which today enables us to look to the future with some optimism. Honduras agrees with what was said at the Contadora talks  namely  that the major contribution by each State to regional peace is the maintenance of its own internal peace. So we agree that the decisive and most important needs are the carrying out of political processes of a true democratic  pluralistic and participatory nature  and the urgent need to ensure better standards of living for our citizens.On the first matter  I am pleased to say that on 26 November 1989  the people of Honduras will once again go to the polls to choose the government that will lead our nation in the course of the next four years. This democratic exercise  which will take place for the third time in this decade  is another step on the way to the strengthening of our democracy. The people of Honduras are committed to dialogue  as can be seen also outside our borders  in as much as we try at all times to use the procedures for peaceful solutions to international disputes. It is in that spirit that the Government of Honduras has participated actively  from the outset  in the peace processes for the Central American region.There were two meetings that speeded up normalization in the region: the Costa del Sol summit of 14 February in El Salvador  aid the San Pedro Sula ministerial meeting in Honduras - San Jose - on 28 February between the European Economic Community and the Central American countries members of the Contadora Group. On 7 August of this year  Honduras was honoured to host the Central American presidential summit in the port of Tela. At that time  important agreements were signed which have helped revitalize the regional peace; process.The agreement signed at that summit meeting  which took place exactly two years after the signing of ""the procedure to establish a firm and lasting peace in Central America""  offer hope for a solution to the crisis affecting our region.In the city of Tela  the Presidents adopted three documents: a political Declaration; a Joint Plan for the voluntary demobilization  repatriation or relocation of the Nicaraguan resistance and other armed groups; and the extra judicial Agreement between Honduras and Nicaragua  relating to the suit introduced by the latter at the International Court of Justice in 1986  in a case separate from the regional negotiation effort.The plan to demobilize the Nicaraguan resistance is essentially based on major progress in the national reconciliation and democratisation process to which the Government of Nicaragua is committed. That Government's compliance with its obligations concerning dialogue and national reconciliation is imperative for the re-incorporation of those repatriated to Nicaragua into their country's economic  social and political life under proper conditions and with adequate guarantees.Under the plan  the responsibility for carrying out all the necessary activities for voluntary demobilization  repatriation or relocation falls within the competence of the International Support aid Verification Commission formed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States.I am pleased to report that the extra judicial agreement between Honduras and Nicaragua  signed with the moral and political support of the Presidents of Costa Rica  El Salvador and Guatemala  has greatly helped to expedite the regional normalization process  including the establishment of a United Nations group of observers for Central America  made up of specialists from Canada  Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany  to verify compliance by the five Central American countries with the security commitments they have entered into.Lest the term foreseen in the joint plan should expire with Honduran territory still being used by armed elements from Nicaragua or El Salvador  my Government has already presented a formal request to the Security Council for an international peace force to prevent the use of our territory as sanctuary. We proposed such a force on 12 November 1987 in the General Assembly of the Organization of American States and reiterated the proposal on 4 October 1988 during the forty-third session of this Assembly. In addition  Honduras suggested the initiation of a dialogue between the super-Powers on the Central American crisis. As we know  that dialogue has already started  and it holds much promise. However  its final results will be effective only if another political dialogue - between the Sandinista Government and its armed opponents - also takes place.Another cause of concern for Central America is the situation prevailing in the Republic of E1 Salvador. In spite of the holding of two consecutive  unchallenged elections and the invitation by the Salvadorian Government to irregular groups to join in the political process  on an equal footing  violence against the people and Government of El Salvador continued until recently. Despite the dark clouds still hanging over our world  the Government of President Azcona looks to the future with optimism. The rule of law is extending throughout the world  bringing with it justice  freedom and development. If we can reach those goals in the not-too-distant future  we shall be able to proclaim with justified satisfaction that this Organization has achieved the objectives set when it was established and that we  as citizens of the world  have made reality of the ideals that all mankind strives for.

"64",3058,"HTI",44,1989,"ï»¿May I first address to you. Sir  the congratulations of the delegation of Haiti and tell you how very pleased we were to see you elected to the presidency of this  the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Your outstanding personal qualifications  your vast experience in dealing with international affairs and what you have done at the helm of the Special Committee Against Apartheid have allowed us to take the full measure of your qualities  and they ensure the fullest success for the work of this session.I should also like to voice our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  who brought the full range of his competence and wisdom to bear upon his work and thus fully merited the confidence the Assembly had placed in him. We pay special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who has succeeded with so much courage and determination in pursuing progress towards obtaining the objectives embodied in the Charter. Without a doubt  the United Nations owes him much for the restoration of confidence it enjoys today. Let it be assured of the fullest support of my country as he pursues his efforts for peace.This decade is drawing to a close with particularly contrasting results facing us in terms of matters economic and political. The forty-fourth session is in duty bound to reflect a period when the international community as a whole is stopping and thinking about these matters. There can be no doubt that we are living through a particularly crucial period in which progressively there is emerging before us a new landscape in international political relations. In this connection  we think it obvious that the United Nations  so long the butt of complaints and denunciation. is  new that it is being endowed with the wherewithal  ready to play a more intensive role in facilitating the resolution of conflicts that have been with us for a long time and were once deemed insoluble. The cessation of hostilities in the Persian Gulf and the emergence of solutions to  the questions of Western Sahara  Cyprus and Namibia are highly significant successes that bear witness to the restored credibility of the United Nations. Rarely in the past half-century or more has the world experienced such dynamic progress towards peace. These results confirm  if confirmation be needed  the overriding importance of the purposes and principles upon which the United Nations is founded and the increasing adherence to them by its Member states. This is a source of satisfaction and hope. At the same time  there are grounds for welcoming the conjunction of factors that now offers an unexpected opportunity to change the confrontational terms of East-west relations. The proposals recently put forward by the United States and the Soviet Union and the commitments made at the Paris Conference on banning chemical weapons give good reason for hope concerning the prospect of genuinely controlling the arms race.There would be a great temptation to believe that this state of affairs represented a turning point in the establishment of a new international order if there were not at the same time and year after year  the growing  unacceptable gulf separating the North from the South. Furthermore  one cannot ignore the still numerous obstacles that continue to block the road to peace  in particular the persistence of various hotbeds of tension in many areas of the world and the emergence of new challenges that rightly command the attention of the General Assembly at this session.Once again this year southern Africa is in the forefront of our concerns  for  notwithstanding certain apparent Changes recorded at the level of the political discourse  the structure of the apartheid system has not changed. Neither the expected freeing of Nelson Mandela nor the release of political prisoners  which could have given indisputable proof of good-will  has been obtained from the Pretoria Government. South Africa remains under the yoke of the lest regime in the world to profess a racist ideology  which is expressed in blind  systematic repression of the aspirations of the country's black majority. It is the duty of the international community  which has been to long defied  to do all it can to ensure that the South African Government ends a policy that is universally censured and condemned.That is why  in declaring our solidarity with those resisting apartheid  notably through the courageous struggle of the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania <PAC)  the Republic of Haiti calls for the implementation of comprehensive sanctions against the South African regime. All in all  that is indeed the only recourse the international community has available to it by means of which to ensure that the black majority assumes  with dignity and equality of rights and duties  its rightful place in a multiracial  egalitarian and democratic society.Following a heroic struggle  actively supported by the front-line States and waged by the genuine representatives of the people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's organization (SWAFO)  and many initiatives launched by the friends of Africa  the Namibian people is preparing to decide its future. The Haitian Government welcomes this fact and the forthcoming entry of Namibia into the international community. We reiterate our firm support for United Nations efforts  vigilant action in the field by the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) and the sustained efforts of the United Nations Council for Namibia. They have all worked together to bring about the advent of a sovereign and independent Namibia in keeping with Security Council resolution 435 (1978).My delegation also welcomes the climate of reconciliation which seems to be gaining ground in Angola and which  we hope and expect  will make it possible for that country to bend all its energies to the task of reconstruction and to economic and social development.The evolution of the situation in Western Sahara makes it possible  notwithstanding a certain hesitancy  to perceive the possibility of an end to this conflict that has divided the Maghreb States for so long. The Government of Haiti notes with interest the results that the parties concerned have achieved  with the support of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the organization of African Unity (OAU) We hope that the two organizations will pursue their efforts to encourage the resumption of the indispensable dialogue between the parties  with the prospect of a referendum through which the Sahaouri people can freely decide its destiny.In the Middle East  the violence that has been raging in the occupied territories for some two years now bears witness to the fact that Palestine is an undeniable reality at the heart of any settlement of a crisis that has persisted for too long. The maintenance of the present state of affairs is in the best interests of none of the parties concerned. Clearly  the only possible course is that of dialogue. In this connection  it seems to us that the convening of an international peace conference under United Nations auspices deserves an immediate consensus. That alone is likely to make it possible for the groundwork to be laid for an overall settlement of the conflict.The Government of Haiti supports fully the convening of such a conference  since it is convinced that just and lasting peace in the region can be establishedonly on the basis of the principles defined  in particular  in Security Council resolutions 242 {1967) and 336 (1973): that the State of Israel has the right to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders  and that the Palestinian people has the right to a homeland and to self-determination.With regard to Lebanon  the Republic of Haiti  cardinal principles of whose foreign policy have always been non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and respect for the right of peoples to decide for themselves  is following with growing alarm the evolution of the situation in that martyred country. The Lebanese people are enduring a painful  bloody tragedy  which all friends of Lebanon ardently hope it will soon be ended. This is why the Government of Haiti expresses its solidarity with Lebanon and calls for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanese soil and consistent action by the international community to make it possible for the Lebanese people to regain its sovereignty and unity  with territorial integrity.In Kampuchea the process of the withdrawal of foreign occupying forces  which must be full and final  constitutes the first step in the right direction. We sincerely congratulate the French Government on having taken the initiative  together with the members oÂ£ the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  of convening the Paris Conference  which  although it has not yet had all the hoped-for results  has none the less been a major step forward in the search for a solution. The delegation of Haiti desires the resumption of the dialogue between the parties concerned and the continuance of efforts to bring about true national reconciliation. That alone will make it possible to put an end to the tragedy that has fee so many years afflicted the Cambodian nation. The Republic of Haiti  in welcoming the proposed dialogue on the peaceful reunification of the Korean nation  believes that the time has come to explore ways and means of meeting the admission of the two Koreas to the family of the United Nations a reality  in accordance with the wishes of the parties concerned.We note with great satisfaction that the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq is being maintained and express the hope that the negotiations already under way between the two parties will result in a settlement that will open the way to permanent peace. Similarly  Haiti welcomes the evacuation of foreign troops from Afghanistan and hopes the fratricidal war there will soon come to an end.Closer to home  in Central America  the initiatives aimed at ending the hostilities and building peace and democracy should be encouraged. The Government of Haiti fully supports the recent Tela agreements ruling out the option of sterile confrontation  foreign pressure and recourse to force among fraternal countries that should be working together in co-operation.The Government of Haiti  sharing the concerns of many countries across the continent  is lending tireless support to the efforts being exerted notably by the United States of America to fight illegal drug trafficking. Beyond that  the delegation of Haiti is fully prepared to lend all appropriate support to the initiative of the Caribbean countries aimed at stepping up within the framework of the United Nations the relentless struggle that must be waged against this scourge. We wish particularly to stress our solidarity with Colombia  whose courageous decisions have placed it in a difficult situation indeed.The Republic of Haiti again reiterates its firm support for efforts aimed at international co-operation and a concerted approach to the protection of the environment from the threats looming over it  which threaten the survival of the entire planet given the accelerated deterioration of our natural resources.Notwithstanding the vigorous economic expansion recorded in industrialized countries  the third United Nations Development Decade is ending on a note of profound disillusionment: promises have not been kept and the expectations of the third world - the vast majority - have not been met.Suffice it to recall that in sub-Saharan Africa the gross domestic predict per capita has declined by a record 10 per cent - indeed  over 10 per cent - compared with the 1980 level  and the situation in Latin America and fee Caribbean is hardly better. Having reached the very limits of the economic  social and human costs we can bear as a result of indebtedness  which is compounded by the pernicious and destabilizing impact of adjustment programmes  the nations of the South find themselves plunged ever deeper into despair and doubt that they shall ever see movement towards a better life for our people. However paradoxical it may appear to some  fee third world continues in large measure to finance fee prosperity of the wealthy nations through a net inverse transfer of resources amounting to economic haemorrhaging feat we cannot sustain and is morally unacceptable.Faced with such a state of affairs  the delegation of Haiti stands in solidarity with all those countries which  on fee eve of fee launching of fee fourth international development decade  call for a readjustment of the machinery governing international economic relations  and for substantive changes in strategy at the level of international co-operation  so as to enable our countries of the South finally to become an integral part of fee race to development.To achieve this  an unprecedented effort of international solidarity is indispensable. Instead of aid - which is often uncertain  lacks common standards  and is not necessarily appropriate to the medium"" and long-term needs of the recipient countries - it is necessary for fee industrialized countries to devote to co-operation for development those resources feat correspond with the needs for overall economic recovery throughout fee South. What this means  at fee very least  is that we must attain fee goals set some 30 years ago: 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product of fee donor countries.By the sane token we consider urgent the adoption by the creditor countries  in multilateral financing institutions  of additional measures aimed at lightening the external debt burden and  if necessary  writing off such debt  particularly in the case of the poorest countries  even if these are not necessarily the most indebted ones. In this connection  what comes to mind is France's decision  announced last May at Dakar  unconditionally to write off all public credits given to 35 African countries. We hail that step  which we hope and expect will be emulated so far as all the least developed countries are concerned. We hope that this particular approach will gain currency.How could we not stress the delicate situation facing the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa  island countries and the Caribbean nations  some of which have just been hard hit by hurricane Hugo?It is particularly appropriate for us to emphasize how acute are the social and economic problems confronting the least developed countries  often disappointed by the lack of international solidarity they receive  which in large measure explains the essential failure of the new substantive programme of action for the least developed countries for the 1980s. 	However  our country continues to have strong hopes of the special session of the General Assembly  to take place next spring  devoted to international economic co-operation. By the same token  we welcome the holding in Paris next year of the second United Nations conference on the least developed countries  hoping that in both instances these meetings will provide the second wind the North-South dialogue so  needs.The delegation of Haiti deems it useful to remind the Assembly of the evolution of the situation in Haiti at a time when the Haitian people is turning a major corner in its history   Having first stemmed the adverse impact of successive crises facing our State  the Government of 17 September 1988 resolutely committed itself to setting up a lasting state of law. The building of a representative democracy  based on the pre-eminence of and respect for human rights  the effective functioning of pluralism and the guaranteeing of freedoms  are all now well under way.The Government of 17 September 1988  headed by Lieu tenant-General Prosper Avril  has successfully passed through a number of phases which we consider decisive.The Constitution which the Haitian people gave itself in 1987 has been restored  and several articles which  because of the provisional nature of our Government  are still not in final form  will be completely restored as soon as the two legislative chambers are reconstituted.In this connection  elections will be organized  in 1990  at all levels  on the basis of a fixed timetable  by the permanent electoral council. For the Government  this is a matter of honour. The elections will reflect the free expression of the will of the people  and will bring new leaders to the helm of the State in February 1991.He are  of course  well aware that the reforms undertaken and the establishment of new institutions  and the forthcoming electoral contests  however decisive they may be  will not suffice in and of themselves to guarantee the future of democracy in Haiti. The experience of the past three years has shown us that the struggle for democracy can be long and difficult. Like many other countries that have recently emerged from the long might of dicta tea: Ship  Haiti isconsidering the promises of the future without losing sight of the serious handicaps of the present. To succeed in building a democratic country while the country is still struggling with a particularly acute structural crisis in the economic and social spheres indeed is a major challenge for us.In view of the importance of what is at stake  the Government of Haiti deems it necessary to reiterate its appeals to the international community to help Haiti make up foe lost time in the key areas  to free Haiti from the vice of dire poverty  in which three quarters of the population are caught  and  above all  to help them find the road to renewed growth.We believe in a renewed and effective solidarity with friendly countries  of the North and the South  in accordance with the wish expressed by the General Assembly in its resolution 39/196 adopted on 17 December 1984 entitled ""Economic assistance to Haiti"". Unfortunately  that resolution has remained a dead letter - so much so that Haiti has found itself alone in the face of the damage caused by the social problems which the country has been experiencing for more than three years. And even after cyclone Gilbert it again found itself alone  facing the desolation of the families in the southern part of the country  victims of this natural disaster  who are still waiting for some show of international solidarity. We must  at the same time  express our deepest gratitude to the countries of the Caribbean who  responsive to our legitimate aspirations  and with mutual respect  have shown us fraternal support  which we value highly.We are certain that the united efforts of our partners can be of substantial assistance to the people of Haiti in their untiring search for economic and social betterment.This aim is certainly not beyond our reach. It is  after all  one of the conditions and the ultimate goal of democratic life. To help us attain it is  obviously  within the framework of the highest mission of the United Nations. We therefore appeal to the Organization to lend Haiti its valuable assistance in co-ordinating far-reaching international action to help the country meet the serious challenges it faces today.He are convinced that the United Nations  which has constantly managed to go hand in hand with our people in its long trudge towards real democracy  will once again be by our side this time.

"65",3104,"HUN",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like to extend to you my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.At this session the General Assembly is beginning its deliberations in favourable international circumstances. The processes that exerted a positive influence on the atmosphere of the forty-third session have become increasingly decisive in world politics. The development of a qualitatively new relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States is of outstanding importance in this regard. In addition  relations between East and West are developing and dialogues between countries are becoming more substantive. The world is witnessing the beginning of a new era in which the ""enemy"" image based on ""cold war"" stereotypes is fading away  with confrontation giving way to an interest in guaranteeing the security of the other side  and with isolationism being replaced by a desire for co-operation based on partnership. There is a growing realization that the use or threat of the use of force cannot be a tool of foreign policy and that problems must be solved through negotiation  by political means.The positive changes taking place in world politics are making it possible  and the new social  economic and ecological challenges are making it necessary  for the United Nations to assume a more active role in  and to take more initiatives for  the maintenance of international peace and security and the prevention and solution of regional and global problems and conflicts. There is increasing evidence that the world Organization is becoming an international centre for accommodating divergent interests and organizing joint action. In this respect  webelieve that in order to ensure that the United Nations shall be truly universal we should make it possible for all States that so wish to join our world Organization. I should like to take this opportunity to express my Government's appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts  through which he has done much to enhance the prestige of the United Nations.The positive changes in East-West relations have had a particularly favourable effect on the situation in Europe  which is of paramount importance for the foreign policy of Hungary. On the threshold of the third millennium  relations of a new type and duality are taking shape on the continent of Europe. As the bloc mentality recedes into the background  there is a growing awareness of an all-European identity and there is a common interest in breaking down the divisions that have persisted now for decades. The final document adopted in Vienna at the latest Follow-up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is the most important CSCE document since the Helsinki Final Act was signed. It has raised the system of European relations to a qualitatively higher level and has set in motion a dynamic  long-term programme of action within national and pan-European frameworks alike.As a result of the agreements reached at the Vienna meeting  talks have begun on reducing conventional forces in Europe. Also as a result of these agreements  meetings are to be held every year on the human dimension  and these will serve to ensure the continuity of the all-European dialogue on human rights.We are convinced that the advance of the favourable processes that are unfolding calls for a new type of thinking based on the paramount importance of the interests of humanity as a whole. The realities of our time demand inter-State relations and co-operation  free of ideological prejudice and based on mutual advantage and interests. Mindful of these criteria  Hungary is prepared to co-operate with all countries of the world on the basis of partnership.In this more favourable international situation  when political means and solutions are assuming an increasing role in guaranteeing security  disarmament talks and their results are being viewed in a new light. The past year has witnessed well-known and important events relating to disarmament. However  there has been no breakthrough so far  and we must therefore make further serious efforts on the bilateral  regional and multilateral levels.On the eve of the last decade of the millennium  we have not managed to reduce the nuclear threat significantly. At the same time  the experience gained in implementing the historic Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate and Shorter-Range Nuclear Missiles clearly indicates that real security can indeed be sought through nuclear disarmament.The Hungarian Government has on many occasions expressed its conviction that a number of substantive disarmament issues - such as foe example a comprehensive nuclear test ban  nuclear disarmament  the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons  and the prevention of an arms race in space - cannot only be resolved on a global basis and with the whole-hearted participation of the international community. For this reason  we regret that the results achieved through the multilateral forums on these issues have been so meagre.In respect of the preparations for the Fourth Review Conference on the Implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  we hope that there will be an opportunity to strengthen the Treaty on the international scale and to increase the number of States parties. We favour strengthening the non-proliferation regime and keeping the NPT in force beyond 1995.The political success of the Paris Conference on chemical weapons has not yet made itself felt in the negotiations that are going on within the framework of theGeneva Conference on Disarmament  and there is still no agreement on a number of the essential elements of the future treaty.In recent years  the Hungarian Government has made several initiatives or taken unilateral steps to try to help speed up the pace of negotiations on the banning of chemical weapons and to promote the early preparation of a draft convention. On behalf of the Hungarian People's Republic  I declare from this rostrum that Hungary is ready to comply with all the provisions of the convention now being drafted and to act in full conformity with it even before it is concluded and enters into force.That means  inter alia  reaffirming that on Hungarian territory there are neither chemical weapons nor industrial plants capable of producing such weapons and that the production of the Hungarian chemical industry and the trade in chemicals serve exclusively peaceful purposes. In accordance with the envisaged articles of the convention we shall make an itemized declaration  to be renewed on a regular basis  on the production of and foreign trade in chemicals. Even before the conclusion and entry into force of the convention  we are ready to accept verification  including on-site inspection  on a reciprocal basis  regarding all the declared facts and figures  as well as our military  industrial and trading activities relating to the scope of the convention. We consider that the potentialities of the United Nations can be used for this purpose under a procedure to be adopted later.In agreement with the Government of the Soviet Union  I can also inform the General Assembly that the possibility of verification extends also to the installations of the Soviet army in Hungary.The unilateral disarmament measures of the Soviet Union and several other Warsaw Treaty member States  including Hungary  created a favourable political atmosphere for the Vienna talks on conventional weapons  which started last spring. We hope that it will be possible to reach agreement at the negotiations as early as 1990.Hungary is seeking to contribute to the attainment of this objective by its own means  including unilateral measures  such as reductions in its military budget  troop strength and military equipment. In the course of talks we have released  in the spirit of greater military openness and on a unilateral basis  data on the structure and deployment of our armed forces in order to help resolve problems concerning the exchange of military data.Also falling within this framework is the regional security policy initiative for the establishment of a 100-kilometre-wide contiguous zone of security  confidence-building and co-operation  partially free of offensive weapons  along the common borders of Hungary  Austria and Yugoslavia  for the purpose of developing economic and trade relations  preserving the natural environment and deepening comprehensive co-operation in the human dimension.The open-skies initiative likewise deserves attention as it is aimed at lessening tensions  building confidence and promoting verification of disarmament measures  including future agreements on conventional forces in Europe. We believe it would be useful to start consultations with the participation of interested countries to explore the details of the proposal. Such talks at the level of experts could make it possible to find elements of common interest. The Hungarian side is ready for that and expresses its willingness to participate in the preparation of such a co-operative venture.The elimination and political settlement of regional hotbeds of crisis are significant factors for establishing international peace and security. As a result of efforts undertaken by various countries and the world Organization  solutions to several questions on the agenda of the present session of the General Assembly have been brought within reach. The United Nations has considerably increased its involvement in drawing up frameworks and ensuring technical conditions for the settlement of regional conflicts. The success of the peace-keeping operations of the world Organization is clear evidence that the United Nations is able to measure up to these requirements.The Hungarian Government welcomes the fact that the deadlock on the independence of Namibia has been broken. The multilateral talks among the States concerned have yielded results and the preparatory stage for the holding of the first free election has begun. Hungary's participation in the fulfilment of themonitoring tasks of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) is a modest contribution towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict by political means.The conditions for a settlement of the Middle East crisis are now more favourable as a result of international efforts made in furtherance of a solution and  not least  because of the flexible shifts in the position as well as the initiatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PI/3) and the Arab States. Hungary favours the early convening of the International Peace Conference with the participation of all parties concerned  including the PIO and the State of Israel  for the purpose of reaching a lasting and just settlement. It is our conviction that an open and unbiased approach increases the possibilities for the settlement of the crisis. Our relations with all interested parties are aimed at serving that very purpose.The operation of the international financial system continues to be burdened with structural malfunctions and with strains resulting from the internal economic imbalances of various countries. The debt crisis has grown more pressing over the years  and international trade is still coping with serious disorders. Consequently  world market mechanisms operate in a distorted form.Unfortunately  the negative trends of the world economy have prompted some countries and groups of countries to safeguard national interests by protectionist and discriminatory measures rather than by seeking solutions to existing problems on the basis of mutual interests. Such artificial obstacles to international economic co-operation impose added burdens on the countries heavily dependent on co-operation and have a particularly adverse effect on those which  by mobilizing their shrinking internal resources  try to adjust to changing conditions and to catch up with countries that have succeeded in their adjustment efforts.Adjustment to the increasingly complex world economic conditions is a serious trial for Hungary as well. Our rapidly advancing reforms are aimed at creating an open market economy based on the equality of types of property and at seeking integration into the world economy. For us to succeed in these efforts it is necessary to have a world economic environment based on mutually advantageous relations and on the principle of fulfilment in good faith of contractual obligations. We are firmly committed to being guided in our economic relations not by ideological and political considerations but by ensuring the priority of economic interests.At present we see possibilities for accommodating national  regional and global interests and objectives in different fields of economic life. We think that the United Nations and its specialized agencies are able to facilitate co-ordination of related endeavours  primarily by exploring possibilities for mutually advantageous co-operation and resolving contradictions and conflicts of interest. The new development strategy for the 1990s  if it proceeds from the real economic situation and sets realistic objectives  will be able to contribute to a more balanced development of the world economy.My Government welcomes the fact that the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms has become a dynamic element of international security. It is our conviction that human rights are universal values. Consequently  respect for  and protection of  human rights cannot be considered an exclusively internal matter of any State  and enjoyment of them must be independent of the social system of a particular country or the type of alliance to which it belongs. The United Nations Charter  international covenants and other conventions embody the voluntarily assumed obligations of States with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms. For us  therefore  there can be no Western or Eastern  Northern or Southern human rights.Today  at the end of the century  we deem it a natural requirement that human rights and fundamental freedoms be accorded equal measures of universal international protection. The obligations of States today imply  on the one hand  that Governments have a responsibility to their own citizens for the observance of these rights and  on the other  that the community of nations can require any country to fulfil such obligations in good faith.The Hungarian Government is making consistent efforts to bring our national legislation and practice into line with our international obligations. Our insistence on establishing the broadest possible international co-operation for the full implementation of human rights has  likewise  become a marked feature of our policy.To demonstrate its willingness that there should be international co-operation  and to ensure full compliance with its commitments  Hungary took another important step recently  on 13 September 1989 it officially informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that it considered itself bound by the individual-complaint mechanism in two additional areas â in respect of theInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. By doing so  Hungary has joined those countries that fully accept the competence of all United Nations bodies concerned with human rights in cases of communications from States parties or from individuals.We have revised our position regarding the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as well. In the past we did not recognize the jurisdiction of the Court  but currently we are considering the practicability of withdrawing our reservations relating to it. In our latest international treaties no reservations were made regarding the clauses on the jurisdiction of the Court.A timely task for us is to revise our internal laws and practices in order to resolve the grave problems relating to refugees. As part of this endeavour  Hungary acceded  this year  to tile United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees  and to its Protocol. It is by applying the provisions of that Convention that we wish to settle the situation of persons seeking refuge in our country. We call for international co-operation aimed not only at alleviating the plight of people leaving their native lands but also at promoting efforts to eliminate the causes of the recent exodus of refugees.There are still a number of deplorable instances of the violation of the rights of national  racial and religious majorities or minorities. We feel that the time has come for the United Nations to live up to its responsibility and to face the task of creating a new  up-to-date set of international rules which would guarantee the protection of minorities and which could replace the system of conventions on the protection of minorities that used to exist but was terminated owing to political circumstances.The Hungarian Government is firmly committed to assuming an active role in this work of codification on the basis of the responsibility it feels for the fate of Hungarians dispersed throughout the world or living in the immediate neighbourhood of our country. Our action in this respect is guided by the principle that it is a fundamental human right of everyone and of every community to consider themselves as belonging to such nationality or religion as they wish and to arrange their lives in accordance with their national and religious feelings. This is the path we think should be followed in respect of allindividuals and peoples living in the Carpathian basin  in Europe - indeed  in any Part of the world. Hungary is undergoing a period of profound change  transforming its society. Politics and economy. Our people  as well as tearing down outdated structures  is engaged in creating institutional frameworks and guarantees for parliamentary democracy based on constitutional order. In this endeavour we proceed from the Primacy of international law. from the fact that the obligations assumed by our country as a sovereign and independent member of the international community take Precedence over national laws or bilateral and multilateral treaties or agreements that are not in line with our international legal and political obligations.Concurrently with political changes  equally significant changes are being made in the economy  with the aim of creating an environment in which there will be wide scope for individual and collective  national and foreign initiatives. In recent years our country has done more than was done throughout previous decades to create a State governed by the rule of law. As a result of the steps and measuresthat have been taken  and those that are envisaged  the reform process in Hungary has made considerable progress. Consistent implementation of our reforms is of vital national interest. My Government does not believe that a single party or organization would be able  alone  to carry out the reforms or to chart the paths and directions thereof. It wishes to undertake this task in common with all social forces willing to serve the interests of the Hungarian nation. Domestic and international conditions are favourable for this course of action. We are convinced that the success of these reforms transcends the boundaries of the region and is an important element for European stability and that therefore it cannot be a matter of indifference to other countries.Prom the point of view of international relations  too  we consider it important that it be clearly recognized and reaffirmed  right now  that there is no exclusive model for any socio-political system and that such systems be judged not by their names but by their performance. Obviously  belonging to the same system of alliance cannot be grounds for military or any other kind of interference by States in the internal affairs of each other. It is for every State to determine independently and in a sovereign way its own destiny and its course of development  and for decisions of that kind every State should bear responsibility to its own people exclusively. This is the only way in which upheavals similar to the Hungarian tragedy of 1956 and other dramatic events can be avoided in the future.This year  1989  is the seventy-fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War and the fiftieth of the outbreak of the Second; both wars are referred to in the first paragraph of the preamble to the Charter of the United Nations. The two wars which ignited the entire world started in Europe. Therefore  it is a strategic goal of my Governments foreign policy to work to reduce tension in Europe  end East-West confrontation and the division of the European continent  and create a united Europe on the basis of the Helsinki principles. We are striving to ensure that walls - both symbolic and real - separating peoples be removed as soon as possible and that a common European home be built in which the free movement of individuals  ideas and goods  as well as the preservation of the values of our civilization  will be taken for granted and ensured by guarantees.In conclusion  I wish the General Assembly of our world Organization a successful forty-fourth session. "
"66",3151,"IDN",44,1989,"ï»¿It is most gratifying to me and to my delegation that the stewardship of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly has been entrusted to a seasoned diplomat intimately associated with the United Nations who is also an eminent representative of Nigeria  a country with which Indonesia has always enjoyed close  fraternal relations. The unanimous election of Ambassador Garba to this high office is both a tribute to his personal accomplishments and a reflection of the high esteem in which his great country is held within the international community. Our confidence in his abilities has long been established by his leadership of the Special Committee against Apartheid  where as its Chairman he has tirelessly devoted himself to carrying out its mandate. I take this opportunity to convey our warm congratulations to him and to pledge my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of his responsibilities.I also wish to express  he deep appreciation and gratitude of my Government to his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo  for the dignified and skilful manner in which he directed the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.At a moment when we are about to enter the last decade of the twentieth century  we are all very conscious that we are again facing a crucial turn in world developments. The global political climate is changing and we are witnessing a transition towards new patterns in international relationships portending greater opportunities as well as greater challenges in mankind's constant search for a better and more peaceful world.A growing disposition towards conciliation and mutual accommodation among States  especially between the major Powers  has led to a visible easing of international tensions and to more vigorous efforts in resolving regional conflicts through dialogue and negotiations. New ideas and new concepts  born out of deeper understanding and awareness  are emerging and offering fresh perspectives on the solution of old as well as new problems  such as the prevention of nuclear war  pervasive inequality in inter-State relations  the destruction of the environment  the menace of international terrorism and the evil of drug abuse and trafficking. At the same time  some fundamental trends are asserting themselves on the international economic scene  further propelling the progressive integration of the world economyâWhile these developments are surely to be welcomed as hopeful auguries for greater global peace and generalized prosperity  we cannot be oblivious of the fact that the international situation is still plagued by unresolved tensions and contention  wanton violence and persistent insecurity. Moreover  the world economy remains caught in prolonged disarray  and relations between developed and developing countries continue to be afflicted by severe imbalances and inequities. Indeed  while it can be said that the political East-West relations have improved  the asymmetries and disparities in the North-South equation have  in fact  been aggravated.If the current detente is to lead to stable peace and balanced progress for all  it has to become wide: in geographical scope and more comprehensive in substantive content. Global harmony cannot be obtained without also eradicating world-wide poverty and injustice  deprivation and disease. Today  international security should be defined as much in economic as in military terms and take into account such non-military threats to security as sharply reduced prospects for economic growth and social advancement  large-scale unemployment  resource scarcity and severe environmental degradation.Neither can our world become a safer place as long as international security remains precariously premised on such dated doctrines as mutual deterrence and nuclear superiority. Following the ratification of the landmark Treaty between the United States and the USSR on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - momentum in the negotiations on strategic and space arms was disappointedly slow to develop. We therefore welcome the recent breakthrough achieved on this score and on some aspects of a chemical weapons ban. None the less  the arms race  especially in its qualitative aspects  is still far from abating and weapons of increasing sophistication and destructive potential continue to be added to the arsenals of the major military Powers. Consequently. the world's human  technological and material resources are being siphoned away from development purposes  resulting paradoxically in greater overall insecurity at ever increasing cost.It is obvious that common security requires a comprehensive approach to disarmament  pursued through sustained  time-bound negotiations and on the basis of the collective responsibility of all nations. Extending the scope of the 1963 partial test-ban Treaty to encompass underground nuclear tests  ending the Production of fissionable materials  concluding a comprehensive convention on the total prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons and preventing the expansion of the arms race into outer space must remain the priority items on our global disarmament agenda. These should necessarily be accompanied by other concrete measures of disarmament  inter alia  the abolition of all other weapons of mass destruction  balanced reactions in conventional arms and naval arms limitation and disarmament. Additional resources released as a result of disarmament should thenFor more than a year a fragile cease-fire has held and stopped the fighting between Iran and Iraq. But continuing differences in interpreting the implementation of Security Council resolution 598  (1987) have so far blocked further progress towards an overall resolution of the conflict. We remain hopeful that the direct talks between the two sides  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  win finally yield a just and honourable peace.With the start of the implantation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence  one of the longest and most aggravating chapters in the annals of decolonisation is drawing to a close. The imminent accession of Namibia to self-determination and independence represents the crowning victory of the national liberation struggle waged by the Namibian people under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAEO) fills us with deep satisfaction. However  we are thoroughly disturbed at South Africa's pernicious reluctance to comply with some key aspects of the plan as contained in Security Council resolution 43 5 (1978) and re-emphasized in its resolutions 632 (1989) and 640 (1989). Utmost vigilance should therefore be maintained to ensure that the plan is being implemented in its original and definitive form and that conditions for free and fair elections are indeed achieved. Indonesia deems it a privilege to be able to contribute actively to this goal through the participation of its police contingent in the framework of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG).Notwithstanding the progress made on Namibia  Africa's struggle to liberate itself from colonial domination and racist oppression cannot be considered over as long as the people of South Africa are still subjected to the universally condemned system of apartheid. It must remain the unremitting concern of civilized humanity to eradicate one of the most demeaning forms of human degradation which apartheid represents. Indonesia is fully committed to the dismantling of institutionalised racism in South Africa so that in its place a non-racial and democratic society can be built.In the search for a solution to the Cyprus question  we were encouraged by the resumption of direct dialogue between the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. But it is to be regretted that the sustained efforts needed to arrive at an overall and equitable settlement continue to be hampered by persistent divergences of view and clouded by mutual distrust.We are heartened by the efforts of the Secretary-General to try to bring peace and reconciliation to other strife-torn regions  such as Central America and Western Sahara. The international community should continue rendering its active support to these efforts  thus reflecting our renewed commitment to multilateralism and to the strengthening and revitalization of the role of the United Nations as the indispensable and universal forum and instrument to that end.The Arab-Israeli conflict  with the struggle of the Palestinian people for justice and independence at its core  has rightly been an issue of central concern to the United Nations and to the entire international community. Over the past year  developments of far-reaching consequence have taken place  in Palestine itself and on the international diplomatic front.Having withstood the merciless assaults by the Zionist regime to suppress it  the intifidah has conclusively demonstrated that the aspirations of the Palestine nation  and especially of its heroic youth in the occupied territories  to regain their inalienable national rights can no longer be denied. That fact and the bold peace initiative launched by the Palestine National Council last year  proclaiming the independent State of Palestine on Palestinian soil and indicating preparedness to pursue a comprehensive political settlement based on all relevant United Nations resolutions  including General Assembly resolution 181 (II) and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  have introduced an entirely new dimension into the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is truly deplorable therefore that  despite these developments and the far-sighted follow-up actions undertaken by the Palestinian leadership  the road to the international peace conference on the Middle East remains blocked by the intransigence and sterility of the Israeli response.My Government believes that the unprecedented opportunities that are opening up at this stage should not be wasted. It is now more urgent than ever before to press ahead towards the convening of the International Peace Conference as the only effective framework for negotiations on all the essential elements of a just solution. Israel should be made to realize that durable peace and a viable guarantee of its own security can be obtained only through a comprehensively negotiated and equitably conceived political solution. We also strongly urge Israel's supporters to recognize the new realities of the present situation and to evince greater vision and foresight in their policies by co-operating with the Secretary-General in his endeavours to expedite the peace process. Indonesia reaffirms its unwavering commitment to extending all possible support to the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PI0)  in the realization of their sacred cause - the early exercise of their sovereignty in the newly proclaimed independent Palestinian State.Indonesia is also deeply distressed over the continuing tragedy in Lebanon and the grievous loss of lives and material destruction resulting from the resurgence of sectarian and factional strife. We therefore fully support the Tripartite Committee of Arab Heads of State in their efforts to stop the violence  and we commend it for having achieved a cease-fire as a first step. But  lest we forget  let me say that the arduous task of restoring national harmony and of economic reconstruction in the country is being blatantly undermined by Israel's illegal occupation of Lebanese territory. Hence  Indonesia reiterates its full solidarity with Lebanon in that country's legitimate demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Israeli occupation forces.For the past two decades Cambodia has been the scene of unending war  and its tribulations a source of continuing tension and division in South-East Asia. But since last year efforts to put an end to the protracted conflict in Cambodia and to the unspeakable suffering inflicted upon its people have moved into a more concrete and hopeful stage. The Jakarta Informal Meeting  which brought together all parties directly involved in the conflict  as well as other concerned countries of the region  provided a first opportunity to start an intensive dialogue aimed at clearing the way towards a comprehensive  just and durable settlement. However preliminary in nature  the two sessions of the Jakarta Informal Meeting  held in July last year and in February this year  did succeed in reaching common  understandings as regards the objectives  the overall framework and the major component elements of such a political settlement.Since then  a series of meetings  between the Cambodian parties themselves  as well as between other concerned countries  including the major Powers  have accelerated the pace of the negotiating process. A further impetus was injected by Viet Nam's announcement of its intention to withdraw its forces from Cambodia by the end of September 1989. That withdrawal has now taken place. While it is to be welcomed  we cannot fail to note that it did not proceed within the framework of  and in conjunction with  all the other key elements of a comprehensive settlement - an objective that we have jointly pursued from the outset.With a view to enlarging upon the framework and the progress already achieved through the regional Jakarta Informal Meeting process  the International Conference on Cambodia was convened in Paris from 30 July to 30 August this year  at the initiative of France  and France and Indonesia served as co-Chairmen. Although at that Conference further progress was made in elaborating the detailed aspects of various elements of a comprehensive solution  it did not prove possible to get agreement on some issues of crucial importance to the total package - for example  on the essence of an interim administering authority; on the auspices under which an international control mechanism would operate; on the modalities of a cease-fire. Regrettably  the necessary conditions and political determination of the parties concerned appear still to be insufficient. It was therefore decided to suspend the Conference and to reconvene when conditions are more conducive to doing so. In the meantime  France and Indonesia  as co-Chairmen of the Conference  have been given a broad mandate to continue consulting all parties concerned  with a view to facilitating a comprehensive settlement  including the reconvening of the Conference and of the working committees  as appropriate.At this decisive stage  we urge all sides to exercise restraint and not to allow a recurrence of large-scale fighting to deal a set-back to the peace process. Indonesia remains convinced that a viable solution to the Cambodian conflict can be attained only through political means - not by force of arms - and that  to be durable and just  such a solution must be comprehensive in nature. Indeed  from the outset that has been one of the basic  common understandings agreed upon by all participants in the Jakarta Informal Meeting. Indonesia  for its part  will continue to exert all endeavours to contribute to the restoration of a just peace in Cambodia.We are encouraged by the positive measures being pursued to determine the future political status of New Caledonia. The maintenance of dialogue  in a spirit of harmony  among the various factions would facilitate the peaceful progress of the Territory towards self-determination and independence  in accordance with the aspirations of the indigenous population  while taking into account the legitimate interests of all the inhabitants.The situation in the Korean peninsula  which is a source of recurrent tensions in East Asia  calls for intensified efforts by both the North and the South to initiate a process of national reconciliation. We hope that the talks to resolve outstanding issues will be resumed soon  leading to the fulfilment of the parties* shared aspiration for peaceful reunification.In South America  the agreement reached between Argentina and the United Kingdom to start negotiations on measures aimed at normalizing their relations augurs well for a peaceful and definitive settlement of the question of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands.Change is pervading the international economic landscape also  with trends of far-reaching implications gaining increasing prominence. As in the political realm  these changes and trends contain new opportunities as well as new challenges. But  in contrast to the aura of detente in political relations  acute disparities and uncertainties still characterize the global economic situation.The rapid advances in science and technology that are drastically altering the patterns of production  consumption and international economic and financial interchange offer new possibilities for more generalized prosperity among nations in an increasingly integrated global economy. Yet at the same time they may well have a negative impact on the position of the developing countries in terms of comparative advantage  terms of trade  and the international division of labour. New poles of economic dynamism and power have emerged  but this is being accompanied by the creation of powerful economic blocs among developed countries. What is most disturbing is that the current upturn in world output and trade is still mostly to the profit of the developed economies while many developing countries continue to be locked in structural underdevelopment  stagnation and even regress ion.The external debt crisis of the developing countries has intensified in magnitude and global impact and is being exacerbated by adverse exchange-rate fluctuations in the major currencies. In its wake has come the predictable social and political turmoil that has already erupted in violence in some countries. Financial flows for development  both official and private  have continued to contract  resulting in a net transfer of resources to the developed countries. Protectionism too  notwithstanding repeated commitments to reverse it  has worsened. Primary-commodity markets and prices  including those for oil and natural gas  have yet to recover fully from the long years of slump and disarray. True  the international economic scene is not one of unremitting gloom. Despite adversity  a number of developing countries have still managed to make the necessary painful adjustments and to post continuing growth. Provided there is strict adherence to the Punta del Este commitments  the Uruguay round offers the prospect of a more open and equitable international trading system. With the Common Fund for commodities now fully operational  there is hope of greater stability in commodity markets at prices remunerative to producers and fair to consumers. And even on the debt issue signs of encouraging flexibility can be noted in the position of the major donor countries  although thus far this benefits only a limited and specific group of countries. On the overall plane  however  it cannot be denied that the changing global economic setting still works largely against the basic interests of the developing countries. It is in the light of that reality that Indonesia welcomes the convening next year of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of the developing countries. The formulation of a new international development strategy for the 1990s will likewise provide an opportunity to focus our attention and efforts on effective ways to enhance international co-operation for development.My Government further believes that the reactivation of the global North-South dialogue has become an urgent necessity. Such a dialogue should not be cast in terms of demands on the part of the developing countries or of mis-perceived charity on the part of the industrialised countries. Rather it should be based on the imperative of genuine interdependence and mutuality of interests. Genuine interdependence implies equality  equity and mutual interest  and should not become a euphemism for new relationships of dependency or  worse  for barely disguised neo-colonialism. Indonesia remains convinced that irrespective of individual interests  all countries share a common interest in seeking more open  viable and equitable multilateral trading and monetary systems  in achieving more stable commodity markets and in obtaining a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt crisis based on a development-oriented approach providing both debt reduction and adequate flows of new financial resources.The threat of irreversible environmental destruction  through escalating pollution and hazardous wastes  depletion of the ozone layer and climatic change  desertification  deforestation and other causes  has now become a major global preoccupation. As an issue affecting the well-being and indeed the very survival of humanity as a whole  it is vital that this be addressed on the basis of equitably shaded responsibility among all nations and that it not become a new bone of contention between North and South. Neither should we attempt to make it an added factor of conditionality in the context of development assistance. This calls for effective multilateral co-operation  including the mobilization of additional financial resources in order to promote environmentally sound and sustainable development that would ensure continued economic and social progress without sacrificing our common future.In the social field  a number of significant events have taken place during the past year. Perhaps the most visible is the ongoing war being waged against illicit narcotics trafficking and drug abuse  which continue to exact a heavy toll in terms of the destabilization of societies  resources wasted  and lives and futures lost. The international community  commonly threatened by this scourge  has united in more co-ordinated efforts to combat it. Based on the balanced approach called for by the recently concluded United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances  both consumption and production are now being targeted. The mechanisms and legal instruments already in place should now be fully utilized by Governments in order to eradicate this menace. I take this opportunity to reaffirm Indonesia's strong determination to contribute actively to that end.During the past year a number of international conferences were held to seek solutions to the ongoing flow of refugees  focusing global attention on that issue. The most recent of these was the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees  which yielded a Declaration and a Comprehensive Plan of Action  reflecting a new consensus and a political commitment to bring about a definitive and durable solution to the prolonged exodus. We believe the Comprehensive Plan of Action  comprising a comprehensive set of balanced and mutually reinforcing national and multilateral undertakings  will  if implemented in its totality by all concerned  ensure such a solution.In the area of human rights  one more step has been taken towards ensuring respect for the inherent dignity and worth of the human person and towards extending particular care to society's most precious resource  its children. The draft Convention on the Rights of the Child has been approved by the Commission on Human Rights and is being submitted to the General Assembly for consideration and adoption. Indonesia  holding the interests of the child to be of primary concern  hopes that this legal instrument will receive the requisite support and will soon enter into force. A world summit for children  proposed to be held next year  would not only promote the expeditious ratification of the Convention but would also provide additional momentum for child survival  protection and development programmes  making the 1990s a true decade of hope.As we approach the dawn of a new century the problems and challenges posed by a rapidly changing global setting cannot be underrated. But neither can we overlook the inherent opportunities and bright prospects. Hence  the need of the moment is to strengthen the forces and trends towards global concordance and conciliation and collectively to steer the world on a more peaceful and equitable course.In facing this critical juncture in world developments the Non-Aligned Movement at its recent ninth summit in Belgrade has shown a keen awareness of the new realities and has evinced its preparedness to respond and to contribute creatively to the ongoing processes of change in a forward-looking and realistic manner  unburdened by prejudice or dogma. In doing so  the Movement has reasserted its historical responsibility and active role in the building of a more peaceful  secure  just and humane world. As President Suharto stated at the non-aligned summit earlier this month.""Constantly guided by its basic principles and objectives  imbued with its unique sense of unity and common destiny and enriched by its experiences  the Non-Aligned Movement stands ready to engage in this process and to contribute its share in building a new world order based on abiding peace  freedom aid equitable progress for all"". Towards this lofty goal Indonesia will remain unswervingly committed."
"67",3198,"IND",44,1989,"ï»¿My delegation warmly welcomes the assumption by Ambassador Garba of- the stewardship of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. He is an eminent personality and distinguished representative of a country with which we have the friendliest of relations. We are confident that  with his well-known diplomatic skill and experience  the deliberations of this session of the Assembly will be both fruitful and purposive.I should like to pay tribute to my friend Mr. Dante Caputo for the outstanding leadership he provided for the forty-third session of the Assembly. 1989 has been a year of consolidation of the much-enhanced role of the United Nations in international affairs. The Organization has had its peace-keeping or observation teams in almost all the troubled regions of the world  and everywhere they have been creditably discharging their functions. The critical contribution of the United Nations peace-keeping in the world was recognized by the well-merited award last year of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations peace-keeping forces.We admire the sure touch  assurance and promptness with which the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  has been discharging the onerous aid growing responsibilities now being entrusted to the United Nations. In this he has displayed quiet competence aid a remarkable insight into the Organization's great potentialities as well as its limitations.The Secretary-General referred in his report to ""the renewal of confidence in multilateralism"" (A/44/1  p. 3). Today multilateralism is no longer an ideal; it has become a necessity. Its ultimate validity has been driven home by the threat posed to human survival by the nuclear-arms race  the degradation of the environment and other non-military threats to security  such as poverty  underdevelopment  over-population and inequality  both within and among nations.Multilateralism today has to deal with a new generation of problems. We have to cope with the rapid changes in the pattern of production  consumption and trade brought about by the technological revolution. We have to give direction to the new integrationist trends in the world economy  with a view to optimising their benefits. We have to evolve new rules  regulations and regimes to cope with new problems and opportunities in the fields of trade  manufactures  services  environment and science and technology.The United Nations  as a linchpin of this multilateralism  must be strengthened. This is the only organization which is global in scope  universal in membership aid mandated by a treaty in the form of the Chatter. India welcomes the renewed confidence in the United Nations on the part of the major Powers.Renewal of confidence in multilateralism cannot be partial or selective; it has to be total and all-embracing. It is unfortunate that  whereas the United Nations is now able to assert its rightful role in the political field  it is still not regarded by the major economic Powers as an appropriate forum for serious negotiations on economic issues. My delegation sincerely hopes that this imbalance will soon be redressed. The ongoing process of the formulation of an international development strategy for the 1990s and the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation provide an excellent opportunity for it.On the United Nations lies the onerous responsibility of bringing to the Namibian people their long-awaited independence  for which they have undergone so much suffering and made such heroic sacrifices. The process is well under way. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group  under the guidance of the Secretary-General  has so far done a creditable job under trying conditions. However  the path to Namibian independence is still strewn with many obstacles. To ensure the conduct of free and fair elections  great vigilance and caution need to be exercised  particularly by the Security Council. The lacunae and distortions in the election process should be identified and speedily removed. After the elections the Constituent Assembly should have the sovereign and unfettered right to frame the country's Constitution. The United Nations must ensure that there is no set-back to the process now under way and that the outcome of the elections truly reflects the wishes  hopes and aspirations of the Namibian people.While Namibia's independence will signify the end of the South African regime's illegal occupation of that country  the citadel of apartheid in South Africa itself will still remain intact. Claims are being matte that the racial atmosphere in South Africa is undergoing change. The world is  however  watching carefully to see the quality  extent and pace of the change that the South African regime is willing to bring about. Apartheid cannot be reformed; it has to be totally dismantled. There is no half-way house to restoring human dignity and protecting human rights. The South African regime must demonstrate its willingness to negotiate unconditionally with the genuine representatives of the people of South Africa. In order to create a suitable climate for negotiation  it should release Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  lift restrictions on political organizations and end the state of emergency. It must also show a desire to deal with the front-line States without intimidation and on the basis of equality and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.The forty-third session of the General Assembly closed on a note of optimism on the Palestinian question. The bold and courageous initiative of President Arafat and the initiation of the United States-Palestine Liberation Organization dialogue had created a positive climate. However  the situation still remains deadlocked. The intifadah  the unarmed Palestinian struggle  continues amidst increasing repression.There can be no durable peace in West Asia without a just and comprehensive settlement  based on the realization by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to self-determination and the recognition of the rights of all States in the region  including Palestine and Israel  to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders. We are convinced that for this purpose the United Nations-sponsored International Peace Conference needs to be convened urgently.The long civil strife in Lebanon has fractured the country's constitutional  political and economic framework. The success of the latest effort of the high-level Committee of the Arab League in bringing about a cease-fire is a glimmer of hope on the horizon. We hope that the current political dialogue will lead to national reconciliation and that peace and stability will soon return to Lebanon.Two months ago the Conference convened in Paris raised hopes for the future of Cambodia. Significant progress was made at the Conference on many elements of the overall package. However  differences persisted among the Cambodian factions and some of the basic issues  resulting in the Conference's aiding without making any breakthrough. The completion of the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Cambodia is a major  positive development. For further progress now it is necessary to adapt a balanced approach that takes into account the reality prevailing in Cambodia and the security and other interests of the countries of the region  and that provides for the cessation of all foreign interference and intervention in the internal affairs of Cambodia  so that the people of Cambodia can exercise their right to determine their own destiny. It is equally important to ensure at all costs that Cambodia is prevented from becoming once again the victim of the universally condemned genocidal policies and practices of the Pol Pot regime. The danger of the recurrence of fighting in Cambodia  of which the first signs are already visible  must be arrested. For this purpose  there is an imperative need for the cessation of arms supplies to all Cambodian factions.India is concerned at the blood-bath in Afghanistan  Which has continued even after the Soviet Union completed the withdrawal of its troops on schedule. We call once again upon all parties to observe strictly and implement the Geneva accords in letter and spirit  to give up the futile search for a military solution and to come to the negotiating table for a political solution. Those who are trying to resolve the question by military means ate only prolonging the agony of the people of Afghanistan. President Najibullah recently made a series of far-reaching proposals for national reconciliation which in our opinion deserve serious consideration.India has maintained traditionally close relations with both Iran and Iraq. We are therefore dismayed at the lack of progress in translating the cease-fire agreed upon last year between the two countries into a durable peace. My delegation supports the Secretary-General in his efforts to secure the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and help resolve the vexatious issues between the two countries.We are encouraged by the optimistic note struck by the Secretary-General regarding the prospects for resolving the long-standing problem in Cyprus on the basis of the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of that country. We urge him to redouble his efforts so as to take full advantage of the present propitious climate.We are happy at the prospect of peace in Central America and the role the United Nations has been called upon to play in that process. The leaders of five Central American countries and the parties directly involved in the problems besetting Central America deserve our compliments for their statesmanship and foresight. We wish them success in implementing the Esquipulas process and the Tela agreement in their collective bid to restore peace.In the Korean peninsula  which unhappily remains divided  there is an overwhelming sentiment in favour of peace  reconciliation and dialogue. India supports all efforts aimed at the peaceful reunification of Korea. In conformity with the principle of universality  India supports the aspirations of the Korean people to contribute actively towards the realization of the purposes aid principles of the United Nations through representation in this world body.The international community should oppose racial discrimination wherever it is practiced. In Fiji efforts to institutionalise racial discrimination are continuing with hardly any resistance from the international community. The report of the Constitution Inquiry Advisory Committee does very little to eliminate the racially discriminatory character of the draft constitution. As the Foreign Minister of New Zealand has pointed out  ""the Committee has failed to question the serious departure from fundamental democratic principles"". We hope better sense will prevail before it is too late.In Myanmar  the situation remains unstable as a result of the continuing repression of the democratic aspirations of the people. We sincerely hope the Burmese authorities will respond to the urging of their people for freedom and democracy and work with them to bring the present tensions to an end.The recent breakthrough on some crucial aspects of the negotiations in the framework of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) has come as a welcome relief and has brightened hopes of an early conclusion of the negotiations. It is essential that the agreement be clinched without further loss of momentum.In the meantime  the arms race moves apace without any sign of a let-up. Nuclear-weapons testing goes on unchecked  and so does the search for new systems and technologies and the modernization of existing weapon systems. The continued testing of nuclear particle beams  stealth bombers  smart weapons and new missiles is hardly going to inspire confidence in the world at large  much less among the interlocutors themselves. Those developments tend to confirm our basic apprehensions regarding the qualitative arms race  as clearly referred to by the Secretary-General in his report. Hence India's proposal for monitoring scientific and technological developments which have a bearing on international security.There can be no meaningful progress either in nuclear disarmament or in achieving nuclear non-proliferation in the true sense of the term unless the doctrines of nuclear deterrence which underpin the present nuclear-arms race are discarded. In our view  that is at the root of the present dithering.It was in view of those considerations that at the third special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi presented India's action plan for the total elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2010. I call once again upon all countries  particularly the nuclear-weapon States  to initiate the necessary multilateral negotiations with the overall aim of moving towards a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world.For the past several years  the international community has been pressing for a comprehensive chemical-weapons convention. The agreement recently reached between the United States and the Soviet Union  and the statements made last week in this Assembly by President Bush and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze  will no doubt facilitate an early conclusion of such a convention. We hope that all outstanding issues will be resolved and a chemical-weapons convention signed during 1990.With the positive prospect of disarmament there is now a real opportunity to release resources from the military sector for development purposes. Even if such resources are utilized for development in the countries involved in the process of disarmament  it will bring some benefit to the world economy. However  a conscious effort must be made to ensure that pert of those resources go where they are most needed: to the developing countries. Appropriate institutional arrangements should be made within the United Nations for giving concrete shape to the link between disarmament and development so that the present opportunities are harnessed in the direction of global peace and security.In recent years the world has witnessed a cancerous growth of terrorism at all levels. India supports all measures that would discourage terrorist acts  particularly the taking of innocent men and women as hostages. The recent international awareness against this menace must be translated into concrete actions to curb terrorism.Since the General Assembly last met there has been an encouraging expansion in world trade aid output. However  the external environment for the development of developing countries continues to remain unfavourable. Official development assistance has been stagnating in real terms well below the internationally-agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. Other financial flows  particularly commercial flows  virtually dried up in the latter half of the 1980s. Commodity prices  in real terms  remained at the lowest levels reached in the past 50 years. Protectionism continues to constrain developing countries in their efforts to increase their exports. Decisions can global economic issues that affect developing countries continue to be taken in forums which exclude them.Many developing countries are carrying out structural adjustments in their economies  as part of their effort to interact more closely with the mainstream of the world economy. This task can be performed in the context of a much more open  co-operative and growing world economy. The major challenge is to work out a package of policies which should ensure the return of the world economy to higher growth conditions shared by all groups of countries.It is essential for this purpose to revitalize the north-south dialogue on the basis of mutuality of interest. Hence the Presidents of Egypt  Venezuela and Senegal and the Prime Minister of India took the initiative  in Paris in July this year  to call for the commencement of a process of summit-level consultations among developed and developing countries on global economic and environmental issues. Some major industrialized countries  such as France and Canada  have already responded positively to this initiative. We hope for a positive response from others.The debt problem is shackling the growth of the heavily indebted countries. A welcome development in this regard is that various plans have been mooted and in a few cases  notably Mexico  elaborate packages involving cancellation or reduction of debts  have been negotiated. However  the level of resources required for these plans to make a real dent on the problems of indebtedness  while putting their economies back on the path of growth  are not forthcoming. And the conditionalities attached are far too onerous.The debt problem threatens to engulf even those developing countries which despite severe difficulties  have so far managed their debts and balance-of- payments accounts well. In most of these countries  the debt-gross national product ratio has increased rapidly. This has coincided with a decline in real terms in concessional flows of resources which has pushed these countries towards higher commercial borrowings. This  in turn  has aggravated their already serious debt-servicing burden. Any comprehensive solution to the debt problem should include a set of anticipatory measures to prevent this category of developing countries from falling into the debt trap  by increasing the flow of development finance  particularly concessional resources  to them.The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations provides an excellent opportunity to the international community to address itself to the asymmetries and distortions in the international trading system and to take measures for preserving and strengthening it. We are  however  concerned over the emerging imbalances in the negotiations because of the inadequate priority being given to the areas of special interest to developing countries and the growing pressures on these countries to undertake new obligations. In the new areas  the developmental  technological and public-interest needs of the developing countries should be taken fully into consideration. High priority should be given to the removal of barriers to the transfer of technology to these countries  and to the elimination of restrictive business practices followed by transnational corporations. Specific measures should be provided for the promotion of service industries of importance to developing countries.There is  unfortunately  a tendency in some major industrialized countries to force their will on trading partners and to adopt unilateral coercive means to penetrate their markets in the name of liberalization. Such measures are unjust and irrational. They are hardly conducive to the success of a ma jot multilateral undertaking like the Uruguay Round.The new centres of economic power are becoming the focal points for regional integration efforts. But we are concerned that this new economic regionalism may lead to the vivisection of the world economic system. Answers to our present-day complex economic problems do not lie in the narrow havens of regionally integrated markets but in a larger harbour of truly multilateral exchanges aid interactions.Collective self-reliance through south-south co-operation constitutes a principal plank of the platform of the non-aligned arid other developing countries. Unfortunately  progress in this field has so far lagged behind expectations. A more determined effort backed by political will at the highest level is required. We look forward to the recommendations of the South Commission on this important subject.Drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs have become the scourge of the present-day world. Hardly any corn try is immune from it. It is imperative  consequently  that the entire international community co-operate in the urgent task of combating this menace. In this connection  I welcome the proposal made by the distinguished President of Colombia calling for a special session of the General Assembly to deal with the drug problem.Environmental issues have recently surged to the forefront of international concern. This is one of the major items on the General Assembly's agenda end  as we prepare for the world conference on environment and development proposed to be held in 1992  India strongly supports a comprehensive multilateral approach to solving the environmental problems.Environmental issues are closely related to development and they cannot be viewed in isolation. In the first World Conference on Environment and Development held in Stockholm in 1972  the then Prime Minister of India  Shrineti Indira Gandhi  had driven home the crucial link between economic development and the protection of the environment by characterizing poverty as the greatest pollutant.Here in the General Assembly  environment has been an area of consensus  a unifying concern. We hope it will remain so. This can happen only if the legitimate concerns of the developing countries are addressed adequately in any global endeavour to tackle environmental problems. International measures to deal with these problems should not attempt to freeze development and progress at the present unequal level.Since the process of development in developed countries has led to the present environmental predicament  these countries have the major responsibility for taking corrective action  apart from the fact that they have also the wherewithal  both financial and technological  for this  unfortunately  the tendency recently has been to rely on regulatory measures which do not fully take into account the existing asymmetries in the level of industrialization and modernization of the developed and developing countries. From the point of view of the developing countries  supportive measures that enable them to protect the environment without compromising their development needs and priorities are of greater importance.Turning to the practical aspect of the question  the proposal of the Prime Minister of India  Shri Rajiv Gandhi  made at the Ninth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries held in Belgrade in September  for the creation of a Planet Protection Fund (PPF)  has received wide attention and support. We are particularly encouraged by the support extended by the PPF by President Vassiliou of Cyprus and the Prime Minister Brundtland of Norway. The proposal envisages a fund to which all countries  developing and developed  will contribute  except the least developed countries. The fund will be used to protect the environment by developing and purchasing conservation-compatible technologies in critical areas that can then be brought into  the public domain for the benefit of both developed and developing countries. In our view  the creation of such a Fund is sine qua non for arriving at a global compact for combating environmental degradation. I hope the General assembly will be able to lend its support to that proposal. As I speak here in my capacity as representative of India  my mind inevitably goes to a date next month  14 November. It was on that day  100 years ago  in 1889  that a great Indian was born. His name was Jawaharlal Nehru. He was born in riches  but sacrificed his all to join the struggle for India's freedom. In 1947  when India became free  the mantle of leading independent India fell upon him.  Having see  the atrocities and indignities heaped upon man by man  having imbibed the lesson of truth and non-violence from his mentor Mahatma Gandhi  he emerged with a vision for India and for the world that was different from conventional wisdom. He spoke of the opportunity of moral force over military force. He spoke of non-alignment against bloc politics. He spoke of one world even as the world itself was being pulled asunder.  In the beginning  his was a lone voice. But soon his association with Tito  Nasser and many other leaders led to the birth of the Non-Aligned Movement. Today  a vast majority of the nations of the world are members of the Movement; and those who are outside it recognize it as a major force in world politics and seek to associate themselves with it. Jawaharlal Nehru brought to the Non-Aligned movement the age-old message of peace - a precious heritage of all the great civilizations of the world. It was that message of peace that rescinded at the ninth Summit of the Nan-Aligned Movement  which happened to coincide with the centenary of Nehru's birth. Let me conclude with the message of peace that Nehru gave to the Assembly 33 years ago. He said-.-I have no doubt that all the peoples of the world are passionately desirous of peace. I doubt if there are any people anywhere who desire war. Certainly the common man all over the world desires peace passionately  if that is so  why should we not follow the path of peace? Why should we be led away by fears  apprehensions  hatred and violence?"""
"68",3244,"IRL",44,1989,"ï»¿I extend to Ambassador Garba my sincere congratulations on his unanimous election to the office of President of the current session of the General Assembly. His long experience at the United Nations and his commitment to the Organization and its central role in international affairs make him ideally fitted to exercise this office. We look forward to working under his expert direction I should like also to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the efficiency and good grace with which he carried out his functions. The tireless activities of the Secretary-General are the very core of the effectiveness of the United Nations and I should like to assure him of our full co-operation and support as he carries out his vital task.The Foreign Minister of France has already addressed the Assembly on behalf of the 12 member States of the European Community. My Government fully endorsed the views on the issues facing the international community contained in that statement  which are common to all members of the Community.Fifty years ago this month  as the Secretary-General reminds us in the introduction to his annual report  world war began in Europe. When peace came at last  after six years of war  the building of the United Nations began - a sign of hope rising from the ruins of conflict. This was the second effort in this century to create an organization to settle conflicts between States and bring an end to war.Unlike its predecessor  the League of Nations  the United Nations was solidly founded-  it has grown and developed now for more than 40 years. At first  the organization was limited in membership to those who had been allies in the war. Its primary concern was to ensure that no aggressor would again bring war on a global scale. But over the years its concerns have widened as its membership has grown. It is new almost universal in its membership. It has hastened the end of colonialism and encouraged the transition to freedom and independence of many new States. Its concerns today extend to human rights and to issues of development as well as to disputes and conflicts between States.Our world of nation States has a vital need for such a universal organization. We have become increasingly conscious of concerns at a global level which far transcend the boundaries of individual States and affect the future of humanity as a whole. We must still work for the resolution of conflicts  an end to the arms race and the promotion of human rights and development. But now  in addition  we have become aware of an important new agenda. There are issues in relation to our fragile human environment on this planet and its preservation that can only be addressed only at a global level. For this we need a universal organization and a co-operative approach with responsibility shared by all. It is vital that this effort be a global one. But it is also more difficult to reach an agreement within a universal organization  where many diverse interests must be reconciled. That is the new challenge that we face.In seeking to meet that challenge  we can count on a new and improved atmosphere in international relations. As we emerge from the shadows of the cold war  our hopes are greater than at any time since the United Nations was formed. The recent meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the United States and the Soviet Union is encouraging evidence that these two very important countries continue to build a relationship of confidence. That relationship is of importance for the whole world  most of all  perhaps  for Europe.The far-reaching domestic changes in several Eastern European countries  notably in Hungary  Poland and the Soviet Union  have played an important part in improving the climate of East-West relations. Among the most important of those changes is the evident determination to ensure respect for human rights. Regrettably  full respect for human rights is not yet the norm throughout Eastern Europe. For example  abuses of human rights affect large sections of the population of Romania and have caused large numbers of the Turkish ethnic minority to flee Bulgaria.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe process has already been fruitful and has benefited Europe  and it must have a central place in any consideration of the situation in Europe as a whole. We will continue to urge that all parties live up to the commitments they have freely made.East-West relations  however  cover only one sector of the concerns of the world community. Our focus on these issues  understandable though it may be  should not lead us to ignore or neglect the legitimate concerns of the rest of the world. There must be no doubt that these concerns  too  will have our attention. There is a need  therefore  to widen the scope of our concern so that all nations will begin to benefit from the winds of political change. The United Nations is well placed to help in that process.Threats to the very survival of life on our planet are the most immediate global challenges. They call for new international commitment and determination. The curbing and reversing of the arms race and averting the threat to the global environment rank as' challenges of unparalleled importance. The arms race continues. Despite some modest improvements  enormous financial resources continue to be deployed  and wasted  in the quest for greater sophistication and superiority. Our enthusiasm for the current progress being made in arms-reduction talks cannot obscure that basic fact or relieve our concern.Nothing short of the most deliberate and large-scale dismantling of forces and armaments seems likely to end the arms race. And until that happens  we will continue to live under the threats that those weapons pose. We are  of course  greatly encouraged by the declared intentions of the two super-Powers to cut their strategic nuclear weapons by half and by the progress being made towards conventional disarmament in Europe at the Vienna negotiations. Progress in those negotiations must be accelerated.There is  however  a danger that the reduction in weapons numbers may be compensated for by the adoption of new and sophisticated weapons which are even more lethal and destabilizing than those in the arsenal at present. That would be a travesty of the disarmament process and must not occur.We are disturbed at the failure so far to agree a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty. We welcome the agreement by the United States and the Soviet Union to make progress towards ratification of less far reaching agreements and to negotiate further limitations. We urge them to proceed to a complete ban. This is especially important as we approach the 1990 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons.The initiatives announced by the United States and the Soviet Union from this podium earlier in the week open the possibility of significant progress in ridding the world of chemical weapons. We look to early multilateral agreement on the complete elimination of these weapons of destruction. The world community has to see a real prospect of an end to this scourge and we call for a serious effort towards that objective.Threats other than those posed by the arms race and armed conflict have developed in a more subtle fashion. The damage to our environment now constitutes a danger to the entire planet.The Earth's very atmosphere is threatened by our activities. Life-giving resources are being destroyed by erosion  desertification and the devastation of tropical forests. Our rivers  lakes and seas are being poisoned with oils  chemicals and long-lasting nuclear waste. Pollution from nuclear-weapons establishments and the danger arising from accidents involving nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed vessels and a further dimension to the threat. My Government is particularly concerned at the potential hazard of nuclear submarines.The danger is particularly acute in the narrow waterway of the Irish Sea  where the submarine traffic of several nations is intense. Already  there have been many incidents involving damage to fishing vessels by submarines travelling submerged. It is true that these are international waters  and in the present state of international law such vessels may pass freely through them. But with Chernobyl and its effects felt throughout Europe fresh in our minds  it takes no more than a little imagination to picture the disastrous consequences for neighbouring countries such as mine if one of those submerged nuclear reactors should meet with a really serious accident in narrow waters such as these.In the face of such serious dangers  it is not enough in my view to be concerned only about rights of passage established in another era. There is a need - a vital need - for a new sense of international responsibility on the part of the countries that operate these vessels in face of dangers undreamt of in previous times.We hold this planet in trust not just for ourselves and for future generations of mankind  but for all life. The health of the Earth depends on a fragile balance. We do not know the consequences of upsetting that balance and upset it at our peril. The preservation of the health of the planet demands global co-operation. We must all promote and develop the rational  non-polluting use of the Earth's limited resources  and we must encourage the replenishment of the natural heritage with which we have been blessed.Serious debate is required and serious decisions need to be taken  and the United Nations is well placed to move the world's Governments into action. Several important international conferences on the environment are planned  among them the London Conference next year of the parties to the Montreal Protocol  which offers an opportunity to take more stringent measures to protect the ozone layer. The European Community has a specific responsibility in that area  and Ireland  which will hold the Community presidency during that period  will work to the best of its ability to promote significant progress.Despite a greater spirit of peace and an easing of international tension between East and West  instability and turmoil continue to affect the daily lives of many people. For many  the guns of war have not been silenced. Conflicts and tension persist in several regions  and there is still widespread human suffering and economic devastation. Conflicts in a number of countries and regions  including Afghanistan  Cambodia and Central America are causing much pain. Ireland shares the concern which the presidency expressed and the determination of the Twelve to play a constructive role in helping resolve these terrible problems.I would like to add some thoughts on two areas of conflict which are an affront to our conscience and sense of justice. I speak of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the inhuman system of apartheid.In Gaza and the West Bank  a heavy toll has been exacted on the Palestinian people  often the very young  in their resistance to occupation. We are dismayed by the methods used in attempting to quell the disturbance by force. The policy of repression is not only unjust  it is also unsuccessful. Only a political solution can end these deep-seated problems.We welcome the steady evolution of the Palestine Liberation Organization's position towards a political settlement of the Arab-Israeli problem. We also welcome the new momentum it has given to the peace process.A comprehensive settlement of the conflict must guarantee security for all States in the region and self-determination for the Palestinian people. Within the framework of a negotiated peace settlement  it is for the Palestinian people to decide how it wishes to exercise its right to self-determination. We will be contributing what we can in the coming months to the efforts of the Twelve to advance a comprehensive settlement. Our hope is that the independent Palestinian State proclaimed unilaterally last year will become a reality  as a result of an international peace conference under United Nations auspices. All the parties concerned - including the Palestine Liberation organization  whose role in representing the Palestinian people we have recognized - must participate directly in that conference.We have all been appalled at the devastation which many years of conflict have wreaked on Lebanon. We welcome the efforts currently being undertaken by the three Heads of State of the Arab League  and the indications that a settlement may at last be in sight which will guarantee the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Lebanon  and see the introduction of significant political reforms and the withdrawal of all non-Lebanese troops - except  of course  the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.The continued capture and holding of hostages is deeply distressing. Many families have been stricken? my own country has not been spared. among the hostages being held is an Irishman  Brian Keenan  who had been working in Beirut as a schoolteacher. Nobody has a right to hold innocent people hostage; nobody has a right to visit so much suffering on people who have no involvement in  and no responsibility for  the causes allegedly being served. To those who hold these hostages and to those who may be in a position to influence these people  my appeal is a simple one.' ""Free the hostages now"".In South Africa the shameful repression of the black population continues unabated. Bans on black political organizations and the black trade union movement remain. The detention of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners continues despite numerous appeals for their release. Many representatives of the Mass Democratic Movement have recently been arrested and remain in detention.In the most recent elections  black South Africans were again denied any voice in the political structures of their country. The elections were the very embodiment of discrimination. It is hard to consider them as the prelude to the abandonment of apartheid. Yet nothing less will do. We note the declared awareness now being displayed by the South African Government of the need for reform. It is long past time for real and meaningful change in South Africa. The South African Government must delay no longer in abolishing apartheid and in working with all the people of South Africa to build a society based on equality and justice.In Namibia  the long-delayed process of independence has begun under United Nations auspices. Ireland is honoured to be associated with this process through the participation of Irish personnel in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. I take this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General and his Special Representative in fulfilling their roles. The next step - in November - is the holding of elections in which the Namibian people must  without intimidation  be free to express their sovereign will.We are encouraged by recent initiatives towards national peace in Angola  and we also welcome indications of moves towards a settlement based on negotiation in Mozambique  There is  in the coming year  an opportunity for a general improvement in the situation in southern Africa. This opportunity must be grasped.We firmly believe that it is only through deepening and strengthening the admittedly fragile ties on the Korean peninsula that tension can be reduced. In 1989  it is anomalous that the Korean peninsula is not represented in the United Nations  and we hope that this anomaly can soon be rectified. The observance of human rights has a central place in any consideration of the state of the world. It can no longer be isolated or hidden behind national boundaries. Human rights are now a permanent and legitimate aspect of international relations. My Government welcome this evolution.Nevertheless  it is clear that there are Governments which engage in massive violations of human rights. Their conduct is an affront to the inherent dignity of man and the conscience of humanity.The European Community President has already mentioned our concerns for the observance and restoration of human rights in a number of countries. We would like to emphasize that Ireland has been deeply saddened by events in China since June. The violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations and the series of arrests and executions which followed have left a deep scar.Irish public opinion has followed with concern the renewed threat to human rights in some countries of Central America. Effective action must be taken by the Governments concerned to end abuses  to bring those responsible to justice and to put in place political structures which will make those abuses a thing of the past.The United Nations role in peace-keeping has been greatly enhanced in the last two years. Ireland has been proud to play a Cull part in these efforts. Afghanistan  Iran-Iraq and Namibia have shown the essential role that the United Nations and only the United Nations can play in the resolution of regional conflict.Allow me for a moment  however  to reflect on what I might term the problems of success.The dispatch of peace-keeping forces should be seen as a first step only in the resolution of conflict. It is not an end in itself. Without the necessary political will to reach a settlement  there is a great danger that the peace-keeping role of the United Nations may be seriously eroded.The peace-keeping function  as it exists today or as further developed  requires the firm financial commitment of all the Member States. It is vital  not least from the point of view of political credibility  that the financing of peace-keeping be put on a sound footing. The parties to regional conflicts have clear responsibilities which do not end with the deployment of United Nations peace-keeping forces. The United Nations peace-keeping role was designed not to replace  but to facilitate  the peace-keeping obligations of those parties.If the obligation to move beyond a mere cessation of hostilities is accepted  we  the Members of the United Nations  should be prepared to entrust further responsibilities to our Organization. I hope that we might see the role of the United Nations develop further in the direction of peace-promotion by encouraging the conditions in which democracy can grow and flourish.There is scope for greater United Nations involvement and more use of its expertise in election-monitoring. The Organization is  in fact  as the Secretary-General has pointed out  increasingly called on for this. Shortly  under United Nations supervision  the people of Namibia will elect their first independent Government. Other elections or referendums are proposed or are possible in several other areas beset by tension. The attitude towards elections has also begun to change in many parts of the world where democratically elected Governments have not been the norm in the past.We should carefully consider the possibilities for greater United Nations involvement in this process. There may also be a role for the United Nations in undertaking related tasks in the furtherance of democracy  perhaps through the promotion of international standards for free and honest elections. We cannot manage the welfare of this planet if we ignore the well-being of those of its people who are denied its fruits because of underdevelopment.' We must move towards bridging the deep divide between rich and poor countries  between developed and developing. The 1980s have in many cases been a lost decade for many countries which is why we call for an urgent reduction of debt.  The resolution of the problems of the world's developing countries will not occur overnight. It can come about only if sustained efforts on their part are supported by the international community. Those of us in the more developed countries should not imagine that we are insulated from the problems created by underdevelopment. If  out of dire necessity to provide food or to repay debt  developing countries choose environmentally unsound path  we will all suffer. Damage to the environment anywhere in the world affects us all. It would be tragic if the developing countries were to repeat the mistakes of the developed world. We can avoid these environmental consequences only if we tackle with determination the problem of underdevelopment.The United Nations system can play an important role in furthering the economic advancement of developing countries and in strengthening economic co-operation for the benefit of all. Several important conferences devoted to development  including a special session of the General Assembly  are being convened. The fourth international development strategy is being elaborated. In the is process  developed and developing countries alike will be able to commit themselves anew to decisive and effective co-operation to achieve lasting solutions to the problems of the developing world. Together  we must work to make the 1990s a decade of genuine development.No discussion of global questions can be complete without reference to the seas  which cover the larger part of the Earth's surface. The Convention on the of the Sea is milestone in the history of international law-making and co-operation  which must not be allowed to fail. Universal acceptance of its provisions still eludes us because some elements relating to the regime for the sea-bed nave not found general acceptance. We believe  however  that there now exists a climate that opens the way for. dialogue between all States  with a view to achieving a universally acceptable convention. We hope that there will be the widest possible participation in this process.For 20 years - since August 1969  when the Irish Government made an urgent plea for the involvement of the United Nations to stem the tide of violence that threatened to engulf Northern Ireland - successive Foreign Ministers of Ireland have reported annually to the General Assembly on developments in that troubled part of our island. Twenty years on  the situation in Northern Ireland remains of central concern to my Government and continues to claim the attention of the international community. The conflict in Northern Ireland is  first and foremost  a human tragedy. We must never lose a sense of the sadness and loss that lie behind statistics of death and injury. This was brought home to us most forcefully in the past week by the utterly senseless killing of 10 young British army bandsmen in southern England. The perpetrators of this atrocity stand condemned by both the British and the Irish Governments and peoples and by world opinion.But our human sympathy for the victims of violence  instinctive and deep as it is  and our unqualified condemnation of its perpetrators are not in themselves sufficient. As public representatives  we have a responsibility to work actively and imaginatively to achieve political solutions to the underlying political problems.Central to the situation in Northern Ireland are some of the same elements that are at the heart of a number of conflicts elsewhere in the world. It is a society divided by radically different interpretations of history  different senses of identity  and different aspirations for the future. The very complexity of such conflicts defies any simple solution. There is no easy formula for harmonizing memories and reconciling aspirations. A minimum first step  however  is to seek to identify those elements that are essential to an enduring solution. The fundamental prerequisite for progress is equality. Its presence nay not guarantee a resolution of the problem  but its absence will surely mean that a settlement will continue to evade us. Only on the basis of equality can we conduct an open-minded dialogue leading to reconciliation.Confidence in the essential fairness and equality of the system is fundamental to any healthy society. It was the total  and well-founded  absence of that confidence on the part of the nationalist minority in Northern Ireland that formed the background to the fateful events of autumn 1969. Many of the basic civil rights demands articulated then have received a response in the 20 intervening years. More have been answered since the signature  in 1985  of the Anglo-Irish agreement  which has as one of its basic objectives the achievement of equality of treatment for all.In the past year  for example  new fair-employment legislation for Northern Ireland has gone on the statute books  and we now look to the effective implementation of that legislation. However  action on the economic front has to be sustained  and equality in the distribution of economic resources has to be developed. Although a legacy of economic discrimination is not easily shaken off  with determination on the part of all involved it must  and will  be.As fundamental as economic equality must be confidence on the part of the community generally in the essential even-handedness of all the instruments of government  including the administration of justice and the operation of the security forces. If that confidence is absent  there will inevitably be an erosion of moral and political authority.My Government has consistently pointed to the need for the security forces in Northern Ireland to win the trust of the nationalist community. In particular  we have focused  over the past year  on the urgent need to address the problem of harassment of the nationalist community by elements within the security forces. We have had to register our deep concern at the involvement of members of the security forces in the most serious of crimes  including murder  and at the growing evidence  in recent weeks  of collusion between members of the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries. We have also had to protest at decisions  within the past year  to allow soldiers to resume service after they had been found guilty of most serious crimes in Northern Ireland. We have raised these concerns with the British Government in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We are convinced that only the most effective and urgent response can repair the damage done by these recent developments.Despite such set-backs  we must continue to work for political progress. I believe that the Anglo-Irish agreement - recently fortified by the review of its workings - plays a crucial role in this regard. But the effectiveness of the agreement as a framework for reform  co-operation and political progress must be developed continually by both Governments. Likewise  the differences that  inevitably  will arise from time to time between Dublin and London in the operation of the agreement must be tackled resolutely and overcome  and the two Governments must  together  demonstrate their firm commitment at all times to moving the Agreement forward.Never has there been such a vital need for innovative and creative thinking within  and about  Northern Ireland  never has there been greater urgency about translating such thinking into practical steps forward. Both the British and the Irish Governments  as well as both sectors of the community in Northern Ireland  have responsibilities in this regard. For our part  we must - as we do - strive to understand that mix of emotions  interests and loyalties from which unionism draws its character and strength. We have continually to remind ourselves of unionists' fears. We have to ensure that our friendship is not mistaken for threat  and our genuine concerns dismissed as one-sided complaints.The Irish Prime Minister - the Taoiseach  Charles Haughey - has repeatedly made clear that the Irish Government wants to enter a new dialogue with unionists. Our door is open  and we stand ready to advance to meet our unionist colleagues in mutual respect and friendship. We say directly to the unionist leaders that there is nothing to be lost - neither self-respect nor political advantage nor integrity of position - by meeting with us to discuss together how we can share our island. The gain will be for all the people of Northern Ireland who long for leadership out of the present political impasse.We will address the period ahead with the same unswerving commitment to a resolution of the problems of Northern Ireland that informed our approach to this Organization 20 years ago. On that occasion  the then Irish Foreign Minister emphasized that""Differences in political outlook or religious belief need not set people apart ... the real barriers are those created by fear  suspicion and intolerance"".Today  I again evoke that sentiment  applicable not just in Northern Ireland but in so many situations worldwide. If our discourses at this annual debate of the General Assembly do anything to enlarge understanding or to help lower those barriers  they will indeed have proved worthwhile. The United Nations proved its value as the forum in which all questions of global concern should be resolved. The opportunity exists to make further progress in putting into practice many of the principles of the Charter which up to now have been only imperfectly observed.We note gratefully that many of the tensions and rivalries that have bedevilled the conduct of international relations over the years are now part of the past. We are therefore faced with a unique opportunity. We know that the heritage of future generations is threatened and that action has to be taken soon to protect our environment. We know that an unchecked arms race is not adding to our security but taking from it. We know that assault on the human rights and dignity of the individual in any country is an assault on us all. We know that we cannot sit passive and uninterested as regional conflicts and tension continue and fester. And we know that the problems of the poor and the underdeveloped will not solve themselves without new and better directed support.We must begin to move closer to the goal of a more just  more secure  fairer and cleaner world and we now have a real opportunity to work for progress towards those aims through this organization."
"69",3291,"IRN",44,1989,"ï»¿Let me at the outset offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Joseph Garba on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session. I hope that under his leadership the Assembly will be able to achieve desirable results. To that end  he can rely on the co-operation of the Islamic Republic of Iran.My thanks go also to Mr. Dante Caputo for his able work during the forty-third session  as well as to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts at the United Nations and on the international and regional scene.The demise of Imam Khomeini  the leader of the Islamic world and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran - may God be pleased with him - was a tragic loss for the Islamic Republic of Iran  the Islamic world and all freedom-loving people. During many years of relentless struggle  he spared no effort to oppose exploitation  tyranny and injustice. Our people have entered the second decade of their revolution with precious experience gained from 10 years of resistance against aggression  political propaganda and economic pressure  and are now making great strides towards national reconstruction with resolute determination and reliance on the fundamental principles of the Islamic revolution.As we approach the 1990s  the world is moving towards relaxation of tension both at the global and the regional levels. The international community's efforts to resolve regional conflicts are indeed commendable  but we cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that there remain many unresolved disputes with the potential to threaten international peace and security. The principal cause of the perpetuation of these crises is the domineering policies pursued by the big Powers against the interests of third-world nations. In order to set this situation right  we must therefore alter unjust international relations and give them a basis of justice and respect for international law.The Non-Aligned Movement has called for the designation of the 1990s as the decade of international law. During that decade Governments and international forums should redouble their efforts to strengthen respect for the rule of law in international relations. History has shown that it is those with power and might who are more prone to violate principles of international law. Unlawful actions by the United States against my country - such as the seizure of out assets  attacks on our oil platforms and the downing of our civilian aircraft - are clear examples of disrespect for legal norms by those who possess power and might. It is our hope that in the next decade  with the efforts of the United Nations and a reassessment by the bio Powers of their behaviour and conduct on the international scene  the ground will he laid for the rule of law.Political and economic domination have been addressed at length in international forums  but what has not received adequate attention is cultural domination. The world-domineering Powers use cultural domination - a prelude to other forms of domination - to gain political influence and to alienate the nations of the third world from their social and cultural values. Unfortunately  nations that desire to return to their own cultural identity are subjected to severe attacks by the domineering Powers. Decisions by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement aimed at countering cultural domination by arrogant Powers in the Islamic world and the third world have ushered in a movement to eliminate that form of domination. Cultural attacks by some Western countries have been carried out as a result of an incorrect assessment of the realities and an underestimate of the strong feelings and beliefs of Muslim nations. During the presidency of France  the European Community can gain its rightful place in its relations with Muslim nations  including the Islamic Republic of Iran  by correcting its past political mistakes and by respecting the principles and social and religious values of Islamic societies. At this point I must address one of the destructive  devastating social tragedies of our time  namely  trafficking in and the production and use of drugs. The international community has rightly devoted special attention and displayed special sensitivity with respect to this problem. Iran is located geographically in a region that provides a link for a major part of the illicit drug trafficking from east to west. That has put a special burden of responsibility on the shoulders of the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran with respect not only to the apprehension of international drug traffickers but also to safeguarding the health of our own society. To achieve this aim  we have begun during the past year to close the ways through which illicit drugs are brought into our country  by strengthening co-operation with neighbouring countries and expanding operations to discover and destroy international drug-trafficking networks. Those measures - supplemented by strict laws and heavier punishment for the merchants of death -	have  in a short time  resulted in a considerable reduction in drug trafficking and consumption in Iran. But because of the nature of this phenomenon  an effective campaign against the international mafia of illicit drugs is not possible without international co-operation. Therefore  the Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes international efforts to that end.In the course of the past year  efforts to gain access to quantitatively larger and qualitatively better weapons have continued unabated  while at the same time multilateral negotiations on disarmament with the ultimate purpose of achieving general and complete disarmament under effective international control have continued with undiminished momentum. It appears  however  that the speed at which weapons are amassed is much faster than the pace of efforts in the field of disarmament. Meanwhile  chemical weapons have become comparable  in terms of theircapacity for mass destruction and their brutal nature  to nuclear weapons  and pose a grave threat to regional and international peace and security  arousing serious concern on the part of the international community.Eight years of global indifference to the use of chemical weapons against the Islamic Republic of Iran has encouraged some countries such as Iraq to build the largest arsenals of chemical and biological weapons and to improve them qualitatively and quantitatively.The international community's failure to respond properly to Iraq's repeated use of chemical weapons against its Kurdish citizens  during the war and even after the establishment of the cease-fire  as well as ascertainment of their practical advantages have caused world-wide concern over the increasing escalation of such weapons. The Islamic Republic of Iran  as a country that has suffered the most from the recent use of chemical weapons  is convinced that the ultimate remedy lies in the total destruction of all chemical weapons and that such transitory solutions as the prevention of the proliferation of such weapons will not be effective.The Islamic Republic of Iran has expanded its efforts in the Conference on Disarmament for the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of the production  development  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The principle of universality is an absolute necessity for ensuring the security of States that have been the victims of chemical-weapon use and those that are potentially subject to be threatened by such weapons. The universality of such a convention requires adequate punitive provisions as well as sufficient incentives. Pending the conclusion of the convention all States are bound to abide by the provisions of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons  and delinquent States must be punished immediately after first use.More than a year has elapsed since the establishment of the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. With the utmost regret I must declare that  despite 15 rounds of direct talks under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General and the with the assistance of his Personal Representative  no step other than the establishment of the cease-fire has been taken for the full implementation of even the first paragraph of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). In paragraph 1 of that resolution  the Security Council demands that""as a first step towards a negotiated settlement  the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq observe an immediate cease-fire ... and withdraw all forces to the internationally recognized boundaries without delay"". That paragraph  which is fully in Line with the most fundamental principles of international law  leaves no room for doubt or for self-serving interpretations  since both the cease-fire and withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries are mandatory measures that need to be taken unconditionally prior to and independent of any negotiations.On that basis the Secretary-General in his proposed timetable of July and August 1988  envisaged that withdrawal to internationally recognized boundaries should take place within 13 days after the cease-fire. The Islamic Republic of Iran agreed in principle with that timetable  which includes timing and procedure for the implementation of all the provisions of resolution 598 (1987). Iraq  however  refused even to consider that timetable and continued to insist on its prerequisite of direct talks prior to the cease-fire. Even after the announcement of the cease-fire and prior to its establishment  the Secretary-General  in his letter of 16 August 1989 to Iran and Iraq  called upon the two countries to begin withdrawal simultaneously with direct talks.During the past year Iraq has refused to take the very first step in fulfilment of its obligations under the United Nations Charter and the Security Council resolution  namely  withdrawal from the territory of Iran. On the contrary  Iraq has tried to take advantage of its illegal occupation of the territory of Iran to realize the illegitimate and expansionist ambitions for which it launched a war of aggression against its neighbour. On the other hand  Iraq tries to deceive world public opinion by raising the issue of prisoners of war - a Purely humanitarian issue - and utilizing it in its campaign of deception.A selective approach to the implementation of the provisions of resolution 598 (1987) is not acceptable. According to the letter of the resolution  withdrawal must take place prior to and independent of negotiations. Nevertheless  out of purely humanitarian considerations we have declared that we stand ready to exchange prisoners of war according to the plan proposed by theSecretary-General. On the basis of the first plan  all prisoners of war should have been released by 20 November 1988  and according to the October plan all of them should have returned to their homes by the end of 1988. The Islamic Republic of Iran has declared its acceptance in principle to both plans; Iraq has failed to accept either plan.I should also mention at this point that there is an imbalance in the number of prisoners of war registered by the International Committee of the Red Cross in the two countries. Iraq authorities have up until now admitted the capture of about 45 000 Iranian prisoners of war. Of that number  only 19 000 have been registered  while approximately 50 000 prisoners of war have been registered in the Islamic Republic of Iran  which constitutes the majority of Iraqi prisoners of war. That imbalance needs to remedied soon.We are prepared to continue direct talks under the auspices of the Secretary-General. It has now become clear that the problem does not lie in the form of the talks or in the lack of confidence between the two countries. The real problem lies in Iraq's refusal to implement the Security Council resolution. As long as there is no serious reaction to this dangerous and illegal stance of Iraq it is highly improbable that we will see progress in the implementation of the resolution  and dwelling on side issues will produce no results. The responsibility is incumbent particularly upon the Security Council  given its commitment in its resolution. However  the world has witnessed with great surprise that the same Security Council that adopted resolution 598 (1987) with much international fanfare has not taken a single step to help with the implementation of that resolution. Rather  it has chosen to watch with total indifference the continued occupation of Iranian territory and the non-implementation of resolution 598 (1987).Iraq must realize that peace is to the benefit of the two countries and the region. The continuation of the present ""no peace no war"" situation can gradually move the region towards a resumption of tension. We are earnest and serious in our determination for peace between the two countries and for stability in the Persian Gulf region. We stand ready to implement resolution 598 (1987) without delay and free from preconditions and excuses. The 1 October plan was proposed after long discussion with the two sides and consultation with the Secretary-General. We accepted that plan despite our comments solely to help the Secretary-General discharge his duties in the implementation of the resolution and because of our confidence in him. Iraq  however  has so far refused to accept the plan. We welcome the visit of Mr. Eliasson  the Secretary-General's Personal Representative  to the two countries. But if those efforts do not lead within a reasonable time to a change in Iraq's stance  other measures must be contemplated.I now wish to touch upon a number of points regarding peace and security in the sensitive and strategic region of the Persian Gulf. Without doubt the security of that region is closely linked to international peace and security. We believe that durable peace and security should be provided by the States of the region  without foreign interference.Common religious  cultural and economic grounds among the Persian Gulf countries provide the essential motivation for their greater solidarity as well as the needed strength and power for the maintenance of security in the region without the presence or interference of foreign Powers.The Islamic Republic of Iran desires to expand bilateral relations with the countries of the region on the basis of mutual respect for legitimate rights and interests  and endeavours to provide a solid foundation for a durable peace and security without the presence and interference of foreign Powers in the Persian Gulf.The complete withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan was welcomed by us and by the international community. The Islamic Republic of Iran has consistently insisted on the indisputable right of the people of Afghanistan to self-determination aid to choose their future form of government. While declaring anew our support for the struggle of the Muslim people of Afghanistan  we stress the need for the creation of an Islamic  popular aid non-aligned government that will be free of foreign interference and friendly to all its neighbours  a government which can be realized only with the unity of all segments of the Muslim people of Afghanistan. We shall continue to exert our utmost effort towards that end. We will continue  as we have done in the past  with humanitarian assistance to Afghan refugees in keeping with our Islamic and humanitarian responsibility. We hope  however  that with the final resolution of the Afghanistan problem and an improvement in social and political conditions the road will be paved for the honourable and voluntary repatriation of refugees aid displaced persons.Last year the oppressed people of Palestine and Lebanon witnessed important and extensive developments. The uprising of the Muslim people of Palestine in the West Bank and on the Gaza Strip  which has lasted for more than 20 months  and other resistance movements of the Palestinians  are a natural consequence of neglecting the inalienable rights of the people of this land. The people of Palestine continue to resist validly and resolutely in the face of the aggressive and criminal practices of the Quds-occupier regime which seeks brutally to suppress the uprising by beating  killing and torturing a large number of revolutionaries. The continuation of this uprising has shown that under no circumstances will the Muslim people of Palestine be ready to accept compromises on their inalienable rights.If the international community seeks to find a solution to this crisis and to bring about peace and security in the Middle East  it should realize that the only viable remedy lies in the full restoration of the rights of Palestinians  or  in other words  the liberation of the occupied territories the establishment of an independent State in the entire territory of Palestine. Any solution that falls short of meeting the legitimate aspirations of the people of Palestine cannot guarantee peace and security in this region.Expansionist acts of aggression by the Zionist regime have widened the scope of the crisis also to Lebanon. The occupation of southern Lebanon  the creation of instability in the region  the suppression of Lebanese and Palestinian resistance groups  the abduction of persons and personalities such as Sheikh Abdul Al-Karim Obeid  and the use of puppets and mercenaries have contributed to further aggravation of the crisis in Lebanon  a country that has already suffered destruction. As if that were not enough  Iraq has also fanned the flames of a destructive civil war in Lebanon by pouring armaments into that country  adding to the number of human losses and subjecting that nation to the peril of partitioning. While emphasizing independence and territorialReassuring developments on the world scene and an improvement in the international political climate concerning some of the problems and crises that I have touched upon have thrust the international community into an  era of anxiety  tempered by hope. Weathering this era and easing these anxieties will depend to a large extent on the far-reaching and serious efforts made by international forums and in particular by the United Nations.1 hope this session will see significant  practical and effective steps taken towards the attainment of those goals."
"70",3338,"IRQ",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session  and to wish you success in presiding over this session. The ties that exist between Iraq and Nigeria are those of friendship and mutual esteem  aid this is an added incentive for us to co-operate with you for the success of the session and the achievement of the noble aims and purposes of the United Nations.I would also like to avail myself of this opportunity to express our appreciation for the efforts put forth by your predecessor  Mr. Caputo  for the success of the General Assembly's work last year.Iraq firmly believes in the role of the United Nations as an indispensable international organization for the maintenance of international peace and security and the consolidation of friendly relations among nations on the basis of equality  mutual respect  the realization of international co-operation in all fields  and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  particularly the right of peoples to self-determination.A few weeks ago  the Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries renewed the commitment of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to its role and responsibility in regard to the maintenance of peace and the consolidation of co-operation with a view to the development and prosperity in all countries. The Conference also emphasized the role of the tinted Nations in the establishment of peace and the settlement of international conflicts through dialogue and in conformity with the principles of justice.The United Nations has been deeply concerned at the war that Iran launched against Iraq and persisted in waging for eight whole years. The General Assembly and the Security Council have adopted many resolutions calling for an end to the hostilities and for the settlement of the conflict on the basis of the United Nations Charter and international law - resolutions that were accepted by Iraq but rejected by Iran. The most recent of these was resolution 598 (1987)  which was accepted by Iraq immediately after its adoption  but which Iran refused to comply with for a whole year  until it declared its acceptance of it in circumstances well known to the international community. It was under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the agreement of 8 August 1988 was reached  providing the basis for the cease-fire that came into effect on 20 August 1988. That agreement also established the mechanism for reaching a common understanding of the provisions of resolution 598 (1987) and of the procedures and timing for their implementation through direct talks to be conducted between the two parties under the auspices of the Secretary-General.It is regrettable  however  that last year  during which several meetings were held between the two sides under the auspices of the Secretary-General  did not witness the holding of genuine direct talks that would achieve the objective envisaged in resolution 598 (1987) and the agreement of 8 August 1988 namely  the establishment of a comprehensive and lasting peace between Iraq and Iran and in the Arab Gulf region. The Iranian side resorted to turning the said meetings into an arena for polemics and propaganda and insisted upon its well-known selective approach  stressing the aspects in which it saw its own interests  while showing no real willingness to enter into a serious discussion of the other issues that would strike a balance and ensure the common interests of the two parties. We have every right to be suspicious of this approach  which is aimed at achieving Iranian gains  in the absence of a comprehensive lasting peace  while perpetuating a no-peace-no-war situation to which no end appears to be in sight.Iraq cautions the international community against this dangerous approach  on which Iran has so far insisted. Iraq cannot accept any partial measures or plans that serve the Iranian scheme of perpetuating the state of no war and no peace. This stance is shared by all the countries of the region in view of the negative consequences of this situation for security and stability in the region. Throughout this past year we have taken care to give Iran ample opportunities  encouraging it to take the road to peace. We took the initiative in calling for the release of the sick and wounded prisoners of war and announcing our readiness to conduct an immediate and comprehensive exchange of such prisoners in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. We demobilized more than 200 000 men from the Iraqi armed forces between 18 October 1988 and 30 June 1989* we stopped enlistment in the People's Army as of 19 June 1989  disbanded a whole army corps of our land forces and  only a few days ago  decided to disband five divisions of our land forces. As regards reconstruction and development  we have rebuilt and rehabilitated the two valiant cities of Basrah aid Fao  despite the fact that they remain within the range of Iranian guns and artillery.	Iraq was  and remains  desirous of establishing in good faith a comprehensive and lasting peace with Iran on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). It reaffirms the respect which it has demonstrated without question throughout the years of the conflict  for the principles and norms upon which our international Organization was founded: peace  respect for the sovereignty and independence of peoples  rejection of the policies of hegemony aid interference in the internal affairs of others  and respect for the territorial integrity of States  together with their legitimate rights corroborated by the rules aid precedents of international law. 	The step required now  after more than a year of inaction for which Iran bears full responsibility  is to go back to the table of direct negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General aid in accordance with the agreement of 8 August 1988 and to work seriously and sincerely on the implementation of resolution 598 (1987) as a comprehensive peace plan ensuring security  stability and good neighbourliness between the two countries and in the region on a permanent basis  under the auspices of the United Nations and with United Nations guarantees.. Iran's selective attitudes  along with its resort to manoeuvring and extortionist tactics  have prolonged the suffering of more than 100 000 Iraqi and Iranian prisoners of war and have increased the pain of their families  who had found hope in the cease-fire.Paragraph 3 of resolution 598 (1987)  which cites article 118 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949  obligates the two sides  in an unequivocal manner  to release the prisoners of war without delay after the cessation of active hostilities. Iran refuses to begin implementing this obligation  however  claiming that active hostilities have not ceased as yet. This constitutes a dangerous precedent. No similar case has ever occurred throughout the history of the United Nations or during the period preceding its founding. The Iranian stand  with the refusal to release the prisoners of war after the cease-fire  is contrary to the legal and realistic definition of the cessation of active hostilities confirmed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its note of 31 March 1989  addressed to both Iraq and Iran  and in particular  to paragraph 2 of that note.This Iranian stand vis-Ã -vis the issue of prisoners of war is concrete evidence of bad intent  of disrespect for the rules of international law  and of disregard for the values prevailing in the international community. The United Nations must shoulder its legal and humanitarian responsibilities and address this tragedy by bringing Iran to respect humanitarian international law and renounce the policy of holding people hostage for political ends  a policy that Iran is well-known to have been practising systematically.We welcome the attention recently given by the Security Council to this issue and hope that the Council's concern will bring lean to comply with the provisions of international law and respond to our appeal and that of the ICRC for an immediate release of all prisoners of war  so as to put an end to their bitter suffering.The Israeli occupation of the land of Palestine continues to date  in contravention of the will of the international community. The Israeli forces of occupation continue to launch one military campaign after another  using violence and terrorism against the valiant popular Palestinian intifadah  which is about to enter its third year.The resolutions adopted by the General Assembly during its Geneva meeting in January 1988 on the Palestine question reaffirm the fact that the majority of the countries of the world stand by the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.The Palestine Liberation Organization has taken a number of courageous initiatives to reaffirm its commitment to international legality and to the resolutions of the Security Council.The continuation of the Israeli occupation  the refusal to accept the glaring aid certain fact that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole aid legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and the denial of the Palestinian people's inalienable right to self-determination and to establish its own independent State with Al-Quds as its capital  constitute a threat to security and peace in the region and in the world at large.Those who persist in occupation and deny the Palestine Liberation Organization its role in representing its people are simply expressing an attitude that is aggressive  reactionary  and contrary to the course of history and to the values upon which this Organization as well as our contemporary international life are based. These are the people who are primarily responsible for the pain suffered by the people of our region and for the state of instability  tension and terror that persists there. The whole world is aware of the aggressive nature of the Zionist regime and of its policies of invasion and occupation of the land of Palestine  and other contiguous countries  including Lebanon  as was demonstrated by its impertinent aggression against Iraq in June 1981. The Zionist regime has tried and continues to try to be the biggest military Power in the region. It possesses and stores nuclear and chemical weapons in order to perpetuate its occupation of the land of Palestine and imposes its domination over all the countries of the region.The whole world is also well aware of the grave violations  by the Zionist regime  of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories  violations that are now documented in sound and picture in the daily news reports as well as in the official reports of the United Nations and many other international and regional organizations. Responsibility dictates that the Members of the United Nations  in particular the members of the Security Council  implement the provisions of the Charter applicable to such situations to deter the forces of occupation from perpetrating these crimes and that they bring to an end the Israeli occupation and aggress ion.The United States of America is responsible in great measure for the continuation of the policy of occupation  arrogance and terrorism pursued by the Zionist regime  for it is the United States that continues to provide this regime with arms and political cover.The United States is called upon to change this policy  which it has followed for several decades now  and deal with the free will of the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization  its sole and legitimate representatives to recognize without reservation or prevarication the rights of the Arab Palestinian people to the establishment of their independent State  and to shoulder its responsibilities by exercising pressure on the occupiers in order to bring them to comply with the international will to end the occupation and to ensure the just and legitimate rights of the Arab Palestinian people.The tragedy suffered by the Lebanese people is now entering its fourteenth year amidst further destruction  killing and devastation resulting from the continuation of occupation and external interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon.Iraq condemns the Israeli military occupation of south Lebanon. It condemns also the Syrian and Iranian occupation of Lebanon. Iraq sees that no solution can be found to the Lebanese crisis but by terminating this occupation  putting an end to external interference in Lebanese internal affairs  and creating a suitable climate of freedom for the Lebanese people to settle their internal problems and achieve national reconciliation through dialogue. We support the efforts made by the league of Arab States  represented by the Arab Tripartite Committee  to resolve the Lebanese crisis in accordance with the resolutions of the Casablanca summit  ensure the withdrawal of non-Lebanese forces and help the Lebanese reach national reconciliation  formulate a new system based on justice and fairness and enable the Lebanese State to exercise its full sovereignty over the whole Lebanon.Iraq has always stood by the right of peoples to self-determination end extended material and moral support for the achievement of this objective. Today we are about to witness the declaration of Namibia's independence in accordance with the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia which was initiated on 1 April 1989 on the basis of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 640 (1989).We call upon the Secretary-General to take the measures stated in the Declaration on Namibia  issued by the ninth summit conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  with a view to ensuring the rights of the Namibian people to self-determination and national independence.Our world is undergoing broad economic changes affecting the course of international economic relations. Scientific and technological developments have deepened the cultural and economic gap between the developing and the developed countries. We note with concern the increase in the disparities between the countries of the developing world and those of the developed world. The sharp decline in the prices of basic commodities and raw materials aid the fall in crude oil prices have  for years now  been causing huge losses in the revenues of the developing countries and thus causing a grave deterioration in their economic situation  a stagnation in their development programmes and a fall in the standard of living of their peoples.We agree that there is a need to extend assistance to the developing countries in their efforts to resume the process of restructuring their economies aid diversifying their exports in order to ensure sufficient funds with which to continue their development operations.Economic co-operation among the developing countries deserves the highest consideration and offers the only possibility before us. The establishment of the Arab Co-operation Council is a practical step towards the positive use of regional groupings for achievement of the objective of collective self-reliance among the countries of those groupings. We regard economic co-operation between those developing countries and the developed ones as an essential element in an interrelated and integrated world in which we would all strive for the good of mankind as a whole We look forward to engaging in a serious dialogue at the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1990  which will be devoted to international economic co-operation and to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries.The external debt problem of the developing countries and the servicing of debts are among the gravest problems facing all countries in the world  creditor and debtor alike. The sums involved amount to one half of the gross national products of the developing countries  thus representing a real obstacle to the continued implementation of their programmes of economic and social development. A reasonable aid equitable solution must  therefore  be found to this problem if we are to ensure better relations among States and a better life for their peoples.The resolution adopted at the Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries calling for the convening of a conference under the auspices of the United Nations to consider all aspects of the external debt problem  in a manner consistent with the requirements of development  will perhaps provide a suitable opportunity to reach acceptable solutions to this problem  which causes constant erosion of all economic gains and human efforts.The other source of concern for mankind is the continued deterioration of the Environment and the climate on this planet  while we consider protection of the environment to be a integral part of the requirements for development  we emphasize that this problem must be addressed in a comprehensive multilateral manner that will take account of all the aspects aid adopt measures necessary for warding off the risks of an environmental disaster that our world might be exposed to. Consideration should be given to the development priorities of the developing countries and to respect for the principle of their sovereign control over their natural resources.In conclusion  I wish to restate our willingness to co-operate with the President for the success of our work during this session."
"71",3385,"ISL",44,1989,"ï»¿I join previous speakers in congratulating our President on his election to preside over the current session of the General Assembly. It testifies to the high esteem in which he is held by the General Assembly and is also an indication of the respect felt for the great country  Nigeria  of which he is a worthy representative.As inhabitants of an island separated from its neighbours by a vast ocean  Icelanders may have had a keener appreciation than the peoples of most nations of the extent to which distance has come to count less and less as a factor in world affairs. The forging of ever-closer links within the world community has been apparent at many levels - technological  economic and environmental. As a consequence  there is new a growing awareness among the various peoples of the world of a universality of interest and of a common destiny of humankind. Some time ago somebody coined the phrase  ""global village""  to describe that trend. Someone from a seafaring nation would perhaps put it differently  we are all in the same boat.The globalisation of issues that used to be the prerogative of individual States has not simply been a matter of historical inevitability. Deliberate political action has also had a role to play. The far-reaching changes that are under way in East-West relations  as evidenced most recently in bilateral talks between the United States aid the Soviet Union  have shown us how effective political leadership can truly make a difference.We are entering a new era in international relations  which  seems to offer realistic prospects for a fundamental transformation of the political  ideological aid military confrontation which has so characterized One post-war era. The successful management of the present transition period will require the political will arid imagination to map out new avenues in international relations  paying due regard to the risks and uncertainties involved.Efforts to overcome suspicion aid lack of trust in relations between East aid West have helped establish an environment in which it might now prove possible to channel resources from costly military competition to more creative international endeavours. The easing of tensions between East and West will thus no doubt redound to the benefit of North-South relations also.I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his valuable contribution to solving serious international and regional conflicts  thereby strengthening the role and image of the united Nations.Strengthening the united Nations implies reinforcement of the rule of law in international relations. The growing awareness of the world community of the rule of law in international affairs is particularly welcome to an unarmed nation  which fought its battle for independence without resort to violence.The changing world environment is opening up unprecedented opportunities for the united Nations. With the cold war mentality on the wane  the worldOrganization can now for the first time entertain realistic hopes of translating into reality the vision contained in the United Nations Charter. At the same time* the Organization itself has emerged as a more effective agent of change.We who are alive now can be seen as merely temporary guests on this planet  Earth. While we are here we are under an obligation to preserve the common heritage of our forebears and to secure the living conditions of our descendants  the generations that come after us.Iceland is a country which is overwhelmingly dependent for its existence upon the exploitation of the resources of the seas. For Icelanders the safeguarding of the environment is a matter of life or death  no less.We are grateful for the initiatives which are apparent on the international front in so many spheres*  on the protection of the ozone layer  on long-range transboundary pollution and  most recently  on the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes. Two years ago we welcomed in this body the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development  chaired by my Nordic friend Gro Harlem Brmdtlaid  the Prime Minister of Norway. The report analysed the state of the environment and made recommendations for future action. This year we started the preparatory work for a United Nations conference on environment end development  to be held in 1992.These initiatives respond to a need which is becoming ever more apparent to the world community. In the industrialized world we are looking into the murky backyard of the civilization we have created - be it on land  at sea or in the atmosphere. To all of us  and particularly with reference to the developing world  it is becoming apparent that without reducing poverty  and at the same time protecting the environment  economic growth will be denied us in the future.We are seeing the effects of global warming  the greenhouse effect  destruction of tropical rain forests  deforestation  acid rain  desertification and depletion of the ozone layer.The inhabitants of the earth's continents need to be reminded that the oceans cover more than 70 per cent of the earth's surface. They are and will remain in the future a basic source of life on earth. For my people  the Icelandic nation  preservation of the natural resources of the seas will  therefore  remain paramount. As we say in Icelandic: ""Fcourland vort halft er hafio"" - or  the sea is half of our fatherland.The living resources of the sea can be considered as the world's food reserves. The increasing pollution of the seas  not least that caused by radiation and by the industrialized nations' practice of using the open seas as a dumping ground for their industrial wastes  is therefore a major cause for alarm  not only for coastal States but for the whole world community.We can view these developments against the threat of the even greater  indeed catastrophic  damage which could be caused by the weapons of mass destruction. We need only recall the devastation which resulted from the use of these weapons at the close of the Second World War.In its greed and short-sightedness the ruling species of this earth  which has given itself the honourable title of ""homo sapiens""  seems not only to be prepared to disregard the consequences of its behaviour on its own habitat  but to be actually engaged in total warfare against nature - even ready to destroy it completely.I was struck by the sombre assessment in the Brundtland report which refers to the 6 million hectares of productive dry land which is turned into worthless desert each year  and the destruction of more than 11 million hectares of forests annually. Over three decades this destruction would extend to land masses the size of  respectively  Saudi Arabia and India. The report warns us of the environmental trends which threaten radically to alter the planet and endanger many species upon it  including the human race. Are we helpless in the face of these assaults on our globe? I say ""no"" - end the initiatives I referred to earlier can be seen to have their basis in a recognition of the legal obligation to work together to protect our planet. These obligations can be traced to the principles of the united Nations Charter which govern our work in this body. The general principles of the Charter entail firm commitments for mankind and for Governments not to pollute our planet  nor ruthlessly to exploit our natural resources. The Charter establishes a duty of a moral and ethical character. Our past  present and future activities constitute an integral ecological whole. The Bible reminds us that as we sow  so shall we reap.The General Assembly has adopted resolutions setting out some of the relevant principles; one of these is the 1982 resolution adopting the World Charter for Nature. We have seen endorsed in this body the principles of the Stockholm Declaration adopted at the close of the 1972 united Nations Conference on the Human Environment. I also note article 55 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Convention of 1949.In 1982 the world community adopted the united Nations Convention on the law of the Sea  which contains  in its part XII  important principles on the protection of the marine environment. The Brundtland Commission concluded that""the most significant initial action that nations can take in the interests of the oceans' threatened life-support system is to ratify the law of the Sea Convention"". (A/42/427  annex  Chapter 10  para. 55)The World Charter for Nature includes among its 24 principles the obligation to respect nature and not to compromise the genetic viability of earth. Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions provides that care be taken in warfare to protect the natural environment against widespread  long-term and irreparable damage. A group of legal experts reporting to the Brisndtland Commission set out aseries of legal principles asserting  for example  the fundamental right of all human beings to an environment adequate for their health and well-being.But it is in the Law of the Sea Convention that we can seek inspiration for our further efforts in the field of environmental protection. It is a matter of pride foe my nation and for many of the peoples of the developing world that we were ahead of our time when we started our long-drawn-out struggle for this constitution of the marine environment. In the Convention we can find the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment through co-operation between States on a global and regional basis. We find the limitations on dumping and pollution of the atmosphere particularly relevant in this context.The Government of Iceland is of the view that existing legal instruments for the protection of the environment should be strengthened. There exist various legal instruments that apply to specific fields of protection of the environment. But new instruments are needed  for example with regard to climatic change. New fields should be explored. We welcome  for instance  the initiative of Malta proposing the inclusion of a new item in the Assembly's agenda  on environmental protection of extraterritorial space.We are  however  also of the view that we can take further steps by drawing from the experience in drafting the law of the Sea Convention. A new concise legal instrument should be prepared  setting out the principles with regard to the rights and obligations of States generally applicable to all fields of protection of the environment. These principles would relate to the right of all human beings to a safe environment and the obligations to conserve natural resources and maintain biological diversity and to provide for utilization of natural resources on the basis of tine principle of optimum sustainable yield. They would call for standard-setting  for environmental assessment and for obligatory co-operation between States in the protection of the environment. It would be appropriate for the General Assembly itself to signify its commitment to this field by taking the steps necessary for the preparation of such a new legal instrument  either under its own auspices or in connection with the preparatory work for the 1992 conference on environment and development.The well-known Norwegian expert in international law Jens Evensen - a judge at the International Court of Justice - has reminded us that ""good planets are hard to find"". Let us realize and accept in all humility that we have to live in peace  not only among ourselves but also with mother Earth.The changes towards more economic and political freedom in Central aid Eastern Europe are both more rapid and more radical than could have been expected previously. As evidenced by developments  particularly in Poland and Hungary  countries in Central and Eastern Europe now seem to have a realistic prospect of being able to abandon a political and economic system  forced upon them in the wake of the Second World War  that was alien to their culture and heritage and  as history has proved  utterly detrimental to their economic progress.These developments are a major factor in establishing a basis for improvements in East-West relations. But it must be recognized that internal change in Eastern Europe does not take place in isolation? the irreversibility of internal change may to a substantial degree depend upon external responses.Present developments in Central and Eastern Europe need  therefore  to be encouraged. They should be looked upon as an unprecedented opportunity to transform East-West relations  to build a new foundation for a lasting peace in Europe that gives more weight to political than to military arrangements.As the use of force in East-West relations has become more remote than at any other time since the Second World War  arms control aid disarmament have moved to the centre stage of attention. Arms control  however  should not be regarded as a substitute for genuine progress across the whole range of issues an the East-West agenda  which includes  certainly  the human dimension. The balanced results of the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security aid Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  which ended in January  have helped to place the security-related aspects of that agenda in a proper context.Yet there can be no question but that progress on arms control has a positive impact far beyond the area of security proper. The early conclusion of the current CSCE-sponsored Vienna negotiations on conventional forces in Europe  on the one hand  and confidence and security-building measures  on the other  holds particular promise. An agreement to eliminate current imbalances in conventional weaponry would remove one of the underlying causes of East-West tension and facilitate the transformation of political relations in Europe.Prospects for substantial and meaningful disarmament have also been boosted significantly by the declared willingness of the United States and the Soviet Union to cease production  and do away with their stockpiles  of chemical weapons. We welcome  in this context  the proposals made by President Bush to this Assembly only a week ago and the positive Soviet response.The reduction of the massive arsenals of nuclear weapons is no less a test case for improvements in East-West relations than are negotiations on conventional weaponry and confidence-building in Europe. If the past provides us with any guidance  an era of co-operation is not likely to be realized if the competition in nuclear weapons cannot be managed.The Treaty to eliminate intermediate nuclear forces on land has dramatically demonstrated how substantial cuts in nuclear weapons can serve the purpose of enhancing security. It is in this spirit that we welcome recent success in the removal of obstacles to a strategic arms-reduction treaty. The progress made towards the ratification of the Threshold Test-Ban Treaty and towards a treaty ran peaceful nuclear explosions is a necessary step towards the goal of a comprehensive test ban.The Icelandic Government has expressed its view that; once the current negotiations in Europe have yielded satisfactory results  confidence-building and arms control should be extended to the seas. The seas have not received much attention in disarmament negotiations so far  although several treaties apply to the maritime domain. The arms race at sea clearly deserves more attention in order that a safer and more secure ocean environment may be created.We therefore welcome the growing recognition that improved stability  predictability end confidence are called for at sea no less than on laid. There is also a growing understanding that confidence-building at sea must be compatible with the principle of freedom of navigation aid must take into account the asymmetrical dependence of different States upon the seas and secure ocean lines of communication.The strategic arms talks offer the prospect of a substantial reduction in strategic nuclear weapons  including those at sea. In our view  the large number of non-strategic naval nuclear weapons should be taken into consideration as a subject in a confidence-building and disarmament process that includes sea areas.Security and the environment are becoming increasingly interrelated. The contamination of the ocean environment must be taken seriously by nations that depend on the living resources of the seas. Repeated Soviet nuclear-submarine accidents remind us of the potentially disastrous consequences of such accidents  particularly if they were to occur in important fishing waters such as those around my country. As an initial step  we therefore suggest that international guidelines for the safety of sea borne reactors should be worked out by the International Atomic Energy Agency. These guidelines should apply to all vessels.I have argued that the problems of the environment are emerging as the dominant issue facing this Organization in the decades ahead. But  even as we take on new tasks and responsibilities  there will remain a need for the good offices of the united Nations in bringing regional conflicts to a peaceful solution.The situation in the Middle East and a peaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict - continues to be of primary concern to the international community. A comprehensive  just aid lasting solution will be found only if the parties concerned refrain from acts of violence and thus show their sincere will to attain the goal of a lasting peace.Israel's plan to hold elections in the occupied territories is an important step in the process of seeking a solution to the conflict. In particular  we welcome and support the 10-point plan recently presented to this Assembly by President Mubarak of Egypt for the implementation of such elections. Egypt has ignited hope for a dialogue that might lift the Israeli-Palestinian conflict off the streets aid onto the negotiating table.We welcome the constructive efforts of the Arab League to reach a cease-fire in Lebanon. A lasting solution guaranteeing that country's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity must include the withdrawal of all foreign troops. The taking of hostages end abductions constitute intolerable violations of international humanitarian law.One of the most important achievements of the United Nations is the extensive codification and progressive development of human rights. The United Nations has successfully increased the number and scope of international agreements. Its latest achievement in this field is the drafting of a convention on the rights of the child  to be considered at this session of the General Assembly.In spite of this active role of the United Nations  the frequency and magnitude of human-rights violations are deplorable. It is obvious that setting standards is not enough; we must  through international action  make Governments and individuals abide by these standards  and we must increase pressure on all those who violate human rights. One of the means to that end is to strengthen the implementation measures aid enforcement capabilities of the united Nations Another key element is knowledge. Every individual on Earth must be informed of his fundamental human rights. We must always bear in mind that it follows from the Charter of the United Nations that a State cannot claim that the promotion and protection of human rights constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of a State.I referred earlier to the increasing awareness of the world community of the role of the rule of law in the affairs of nations. In this connection the Government of Iceland welcomes the inclusion in the agenda of this session of the item on a united Nations decade of international law  following the Hague Declaration of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. We note the incorporation in that Declaration of references to many of the principles of the rule of law which  as I have indicated today  should govern relations between States.More than 1 000 years ago the Icelandic Althing - the oldest parliamentary assembly in the world - adopted the principle of the rule of law to guide the relations between the various interests in the newly established republic. This principle - Legibus gentes sunt moderandae - was inscribed on the gavel used for many years in this noble Assembly. We are reassured that in the era of co-operation that we are now entering  the world community will let its actions be guided by this universal principle of the rule of law."
"72",3432,"ISR",44,1989,"ï»¿The United Nations was founded by the nations that had fought and won the most terrible war mankind has known - a war against racism  fascism  and man's inhumanity to man. This war began with Hitler's onslaught on Poland.Fifty years ago this week  after intense fighting  the German army entered Warsaw  it was the inevitable outcome of the agreement reached at Munich a year earlier  in which Britain and France surrendered to Hitler's demands and sacrificed democratic Czechoslovakia in the name of self-determination and for the sake of what they thought was ""peace in our time"".The month of September 1939 marked the beginning of the greatest and most terrible war known to mankind. That war will for ever be associated with the Holocaust - the systematic attempt by Nazi Germany to annihilate the Jewish people. Six million Jews - almost all of Europe's Jews - were murdered  first by being starved  beaten and shot to death  and later by being gassed in industrialized murder factories designed and installed for the express purpose of mass murder of Jews at Auschwitz  Majdanek  Treblinka  Sobibor  Dachau  Bergen-Belsen and other now infamous sites. Wherever the German army reached  no Jewish community escaped. In every town and village occupied by the Wehrmacht scarcely any Jews survived.At first  no one knew; and then no one believed. And then when it was already known in the capitals of the Allied Powers that day by day thousands of Jews - men  women and children - were being put to death  nothing was done to help. Many still prefer to believe that nothing could have been done - that the German army was too powerful  the Allies too weak  the distances too great. But now we know. Much could have been done; many could have been saved. In April of 1943  the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto revolted. A handful of men and women  almost unarmed  facing impossible odds  they held out against the German army for one whole month. At that time  von Paulus' army had already been crushed at Stalingrad  Rommel had been defeated in the Western Desert and Allied armies had landed in North Africa. Allied forces were bombing the cities of Germany by day and night. The Allies were winning the war on land  at sea  and in the air.But no help  not even a sign of encouragement  was extended to the Jewish fighters of the Warsaw Ghetto.It was in the two following years  leading up to the Nazi surrender  that the Nazi murder machine moved into high gear and millions of Jews were murdered. In the closing months of the war in Europe  while the German army was reeling in defeat on all fronts  the crematoria continued to devour their victims. It was during the very last months of the war that Hungarian Jewry perished.Many of those Jews who succeeded to escape Hitler's Europe and tried to reach the shores of Palestine were turned back to certain death.The Holocaust  the murder of six million by Nazi Germany and its henchmen  the abandonment of the Jews by the rest of the world  remains engraved forever in the heart and soul of mankind.In November 1947  the Holocaust still a vivid memory  the United Nations General Assembly reaffirmed a decision taken by the League of Nations 26 years earlier. Then the League had given international recognition to the Zionist movement and its goal - the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. In 1947  the United Nations called for the establishment of the Jewish State in a fraction of the territory originally designated for this purpose by the League of Nations.That decision was rejected by the Arab world  just as the Arab world had over the years consistently denied the rights of the Jewish people in their ancienthomeland. As the British Mandate expired on 15 May 1948 and Israel's independence was declared  Israel was invaded by the armies of the surrounding Arab States. In those days  Israel stood alone  650 000 Jews fighting for their lives only a few years after Europe had been turned into a Jewish graveyard. Israel had no choice but to win that war  just as it had to win four succeeding wars launched against it by the surrounding Arab countries.The United Nations resolution of 1947 is today part of Israel's history  an expression of support for Zionism - the right of the Jewish people to their own State in their ancient homeland. But in 1975  the United Nations General Assembly  greatly enlarged  but unfortunately not grown in moral stature  adopted the infamous ""Zionism is racism"" resolution that makes a sham of the United Nations resolution adopted 2 8 years earlier  and that continues to this day to be a stain on the record of the Organization. As long as this resolution is not revoked  no moral authority can accompany United Nations decisions  and an air of hypocrisy continues to envelop its debates.Israel has learned to be in the minority at the United Nations  just as we have learned to exist in the dangerous environment of the Middle East. We live in a constant state of alert  allocating a great part of our resources to defence  determined to fight terrorism and ward off aggression.Some say that this is paranoia - a paranoia engendered by the Holocaust  the Jews still living in fear of their very existence  preparing to defend themselves against imaginary enemies. But is this really a figment of Israel's imagination? The Arab armies surrounding Israel maintain an inventory of modern weaponry - tanks  aircraft  missiles  artillery - larger than all the weaponry of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. During the past decade  military equipment valued at about 100 billion dollars was purchased by the countries of that area. Weask ourselves  why is this weaponry there  most of it directed against Israel? Is it possible that these weapons might be used against Israel  and against Israel's civilian population?We have already experienced five wars? we have lost thousands of our sons in Israel's defence. We see around us a Middle East that is brutal and fanatic  where no mercy is shown even to civilians. A million soldiers were killed in the Iraqi-Iranian war  where the most modern weapons of mass destruction were applied  including chemical warfare used on a massive scale by the Iraqi army. The universal agreement against the use of chemical warfare was broken not only in attacks against combatants  but also against Kurdish civilian villages. These outrages went almost unnoticed by the world  but not by us in Israel  remembering our own experience and knowing that Iraq is closer to Israel than New York is to Washington.In recent months  the civilian population of Beirut and the Christian enclave north of Beirut were under fire from Syrian army artillery. The killing of innocent civilians went on day by day  the attackers gaining confidence that they can continue the killings with impunity. Is it then paranoia when Israel  in this environment and under these circumstances  feels itself threatened?Are we aspiring to a needless luxury when we put forth the claim to secure and recognized boundaries? Are we wasting our resources when we maintain an army capable of defending ourselves? Are we imposing on the great nations of the world when we plead with them not to arm those of our neighbours that daily announce their hostility to Israel? Are we wrong when we ask that no encouragement be given to terrorists who in their war on Israel have committed some of the worst atrocities the world has seen since the Second World War? And yet Israel  embattled and beleaguered  continues in the quest for peace. Many of the Arab rulers seem to have no desire for peace with Israel  no matter what the conditions. Worse yet  it is the aim of these rulers to prevent others from making peace with us.As a result  the peace process in the Middle East moves at a glacial pace. It took 30 years before Egypt reached out to meet Israel's outstretched hand - 30 years and five wars. Israel paid a tremendous price for the Israeli-Egyptian peace Treaty  a price unprecedented in the annals of conflict resolution between nations  with the signing of that Treaty 10 years ago  we had hoped that the other Arab States would quickly enter into negotiations with us  but this has not happened - at least not yet.In May of 1983 we signed an agreement with Lebanon that would have normalized relations between our two countries and that entailed the withdrawal of the Israel Defence Forces from Southern Lebanon. But that agreement was scuttled by Syrian interference. They had other plans for Lebanon. Six years have passed and the Lebanese tragedy continues. Southern Lebanon is still a staging-ground for terrorist attacks by the PLO and the Hezbollah against the towns and villages on Israel's northern border.This is the threatening nature of our environment  and we ignore it only at our peril. However  we will not resign ourselves to this cruel reality. We will leave no stone unturned in our quest for peace.That is why  in April of this year  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir unveiled Israel's four-point peace initiative. We call for a common Israeli-Egyptian effort to build  on the foundations of the Camp David accords that brought about the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty  a comprehensive peace for the Middle East. We call on the 20 Arab countries  at present in a state of war with Israel  to cease hostile propaganda and economic boycott and begin a process of normalizing their relations with Israel. We call on the international community of nations to participate in an effort to rehabilitate the Palestinian refugee camps in Judea  Samaria and Gaza.We call on the Palestinian Arab population in Judea  Samaria and Gaza to cease acts of terrorism and violence  and we announce our readiness to hold free democratic elections so that they can choose their representatives for negotiations with Israel on an interim agreement and eventually on the terms of a permanent settlement. There is no alternative way to move the Middle Eastern peace process forward. Rejection of this initiative is synonymous with rejecting progress towards peace. We call on all nations to support Israel's peace initiative  and we call on the Arab world to respond favourably to it. This is not the time to attempt towring concessions from Israel that relate to the permanent settlement. Our immediate objective must be to put an end to violence and to get negotiations going. Putting the cart before the horse can only stall the process itself.If the representatives of the Palestinian Arab population in Judea  Samaria and Gaza will come to the negotiating table cognizant not only of the rights and aspirations of the population that will have freely chosen them  but also aware of Israel's rights and legitimate concerns  there is an excellent chance that negotiations will lead to agreement. Moreover  the democratic experience not as yet prevalent in the Middle East will no doubt serve as an example to all nations of the region. That in itself will be an important contribution to peace in the area  because war and terrorism do not flourish in democratic societies. I urge all member nations of this Organization to lend their support to Israel's continuing efforts to end warfare and bloodshed in the Middle East.I call on the representatives of Algeria  Bahrain  Djibouti  Iraq  Jordan  Kuwait  Lebanon  Libya  Morocco  Mauritania  Oman  Qatar  Saudi Arabia  Somalia  Sudan  Syria  Tunisia  the United Arab Emirates  the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen to utilize the opportunity of our presence at the United Nations General Assembly and to meet with me to discuss how we can move from belligerency to peace  and from hostility to friendship.I call on the Palestinian Arab population in Judea  Samaria and Gaza to desist from violent acts and to make every effort to help establish the conditions that will permit the holding of free  democratic elections.The peace process in the Middle East requires courage  patience and perseverance. We in Israel are dedicated to the peace process. We shall continue to pursue it despite all obstacles. We expect your support."
"73",3479,"ITA",44,1989,"ï»¿Sir  I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am particularly happy to do so because you represent a friendly country and have both the will and the ability to continue the highly valued work of your predecessor at an important juncture in international affairs.I should also have wished to see here  beside me  someone whom so many of you will remember as a friend and firm supporter of the work of the United Nations  Ambassador Migliuolo  who passed away the other day. I think of him with deep sorrow and affection  recalling his dedicated commitment  both personal and professional. The countries of the European Community have broadly similar views on the main foreign policy issues. As these views have already been expressed by France  there is no need for me to reiterate Italy's position. Instead  I should like to voice my concern that our countries should fully appreciate the international Ganges currently taking place and draw the proper conclusions. Indeed  in the next few years we shall be required increasingly to choose between two policies or approaches. One I would call ""integration"" and the other ""disintegration"". Choice of the former course would mean a policy of co-operation  co-ordination and the progressive transfer of national sovereignty  while the latter choice would tend to aggravate conflicts and tensions  inhibit dialogue and weaken the impact of the major international organizations. Our future depends on our ability  through integration  to reconstruct the one world glimpsed as no more than a brief illusion in the immediate post-war period.Prom this very rostrum President Gorbachev announced last December that the Soviet State had abandoned its philosophy of distinctiveness  dating from its inception  in favour of the idea of interdependence  which is a prerequisite for any form of integration.The Western countries belonging to the European Community and the Atlantic Alliance responded promptly to this long-awaited change of course. The results are now apparent to all. Countries from opposite - although no longer actively antagonistic - blocs are meeting in Vienna to reduce the size of their conventional arsenals. The Atlantic Alliance is sending out new signals calling for the gradual substitution of political confrontation for military confrontation. The industrial democracies are making a concerted effort to assist the Eastern countries in their difficult transition to pluralism and a market economy.In North-South relations  too  the climate of sterile debates  ideological recriminations and illusions of self-sufficiency is slowly dissipating. We are pleased to see that the principle of integration has prevailed in the Final Document of the Non-Aligned Conference held at Belgrade. With the increasing renunciation of the use of force in international relations  the search for areas of complementarities and convergence is intensifying. We are emerging from a period of appallingly destructive and tragically pointless wars. Wars can no longer be won  as we have seen in the conflict between Iran and Iraq  which even now has not yet ended in a true and lasting peace. For one generation  at least  the memory of this senseless slaughter will be a further incentive for compromise. On the other hand  the increasing uselessness of military strength for purposes of prestige and domination has helped to start a promising trend towards growing cooperation among peoples. This will determine the success of the important negotiations on disarmament ranging from talks between the major Powers on the reduction of nuclear weapons to multilateral discussions on the total elimination of chemical weapons and on drastic cuts in offensive capabilities also in the field of conventional weapons. The substantial progress made in the latest US-USSR talks shows the validity of the goals which are also being pursued by Italy in Vienna and Geneva  where we expect conclusive results in the course of the next few months. The significant proposals announced to the Assembly by President Bush will help in this direction.Integration is achieved through the exercise of freedom  democracy and pluralism - in essence  the rights first codified at the international level by the United Nations. Freedom  complementarity and solidarity must be the guiding principles of a new coexistence. Since the meeting in Vienna of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  it is harder to evade the obligation to respect fundamental freedoms by invoking national sovereignty  for verification measures are being perfected just as much in this area as in weapons control. Respect for human rights  among other considerations  makes the continued existence of such punishments as the death penalty unacceptable in our view. Italy is actively involved in efforts to facilitate the approval of the Second Optional Protocol on the abolition of the death penalty. Similarly  we feel it would be most appropriate to agree to a moratorium on the execution of death sentences already passed or of those pronounced during the next three years. Italy would also like to see the adoption of the international convention on the rights of the child.The logic of integration is negated when countries import technology while ignoring the fact that economic progress and democracy are two sides of the same coin. And then there are cases where  on the pretext of alleged racial differences  unnatural segregation measures are imposed  and human beings are denied full recognition of their dignity  even though some changes in the right direction can be discerned  for example  in South Africa. In the Arab-Israeli conflict  each of the contending parties may be tempted to resolve the issue by disregarding the other side and its rights  so that the growing toll of bloodshed and violence could set back any hopes of peace for years and generations  whereas it is only through dialogue that Manichaean opposing views can be set aside. The latest proposals of President Mubarak have our full support  as they open up prospects for the future which  as they are not of unlimited duration  must be promptly utilized. We are dismayed at the danger of disintegration facing Lebanon  where the tangled web of animosities and extraneous involvements has thus far prevented the achievement of the necessary conditions for the restoration of order and justice. Unfortunately  in the Horn of Africa  Cyprus  Central America  Afghanistan and Cambodia  a general peace settlement remains an unattained objective  although to differing degrees.Integration  in short  is lacking wherever there is a temptation to engage in protectionism and an unawareness of the fact that economic growth phenomena are inevitably interlinked  and that our general well-being will be substantially influenced  in years to come  by the way in which they interact. Integration must be sought gradually and pragmatically wherever and whenever it can be accomplished by suitable means. This is also the reason why Italy welcomes  promotes and supports regional groupings - the existing ones to which it belongs  and those still at the embryonic stage  yet full of promise  which we see emerging on all sides  including the other side of the Mediterranean Sea. The new trend towards forming regional associations  on a direct and immediate basis  without jeopardizing the equilibrium of States belonging to different international groups  should be welcomed. On our continent the formation of national States has partly submerged regional realities  but these will have to utilize Europe  and not just the Europe of the Community  as a space in which to regain their identity and ethnic and cultural diversity  without encouraging desegregation.Public opinion in the Western countries perceives those ills that cross national boundaries - such as organized crime  drug trafficking  the spread of major infectious diseases and the destruction of the environment - as a threat to survival. Responsibility for co-ordinating action to combat evils that could affect the entire world lies primarily with the international organizations. The survival of our planet therefore calls for the strengthening of our multilateral institutions  for they help us to rid ourselves of ambitions and fears  to reorient our perception of danger and to decide on the reallocation of resources  which is especially important when we consider the amounts wasted on the arms race. As Lester Brown said  -To persist in investing in military security while ignoring social  economic and environmental needs is tantamount to destroying a. house in order to build a surrounding wall.""The deterioration of the environment is a problem that transcends ideologies and differences in political systems. It is not just a specific consequence of an obsession with profits  but is also found where public opinion exerts insufficient influence and where technological backwardness damages nature in ways that have yet to be fully explored. The five warmest years of the century all occurred in this decade  and the Earth could not withstand the pressure that would result from extending traditional development to the two thirds of mankind that have not yet experienced it. All too often the impulse to destroy arises for the guest for immediate gains  possibly to meet schemed dates for the repayment of debts. The wealthier countries must sometimes choose between recovering a credit and giving up a vital dose of oxygen.What can be done in a world that is changing so rapidly before our very eyes? Western Europe must continue its progress towards a new supranational identity. Many things depend  both within and outside our continent  on the success or failure of this revolutionary project. The success of this integration and of its extension to the Eastern countries in Europe will be crucial to the restoration of Europe's centrality after a long partial eclipse. The European Community is the result of a generous impulse to project well-being beyond national boundaries. It would not be true to its origins if it retreated into its shell to become a fortress of privilege  and if growth in its internal cohesion were accompanied by a distancing between the Twelve and the surging world. The European community  must make an effort  in the years to come  to identify new forms of cooperation including institutional co-operation  with countries that are too similar not to wish to join or  if dissimilar  too dependent not to want at least to be associated. It can avail itself of the means prided by article 238 of the Treaty of Rome  which seems to me to be particularly helpful for the extension of the co-operation effort to two regions. Central Europe and the southern shores of the Mediterranean.  Central Europe is the ideal place for the formation of political  economic and cultural ties in such a way as to smooth the path of continental integration and avoid any sudden changes too traumatic for a world in need of gradualism after the divisions of the past.During this month of September  with its bitter anniversaries for Europe  it is significant that in Poland and Hungary  an omnipresent totalitarian power structure  in existence until just recently  should progressively make way for alternative methods of government based on Parliaments and the popular vote. The industrial democracies must give concrete proof of their readiness to contribute to the economic costs of this transition  even though there are other  even needier  cases elsewhere in the world deserving of their support. For its part  my country wishes to promote in Middle Europe a special co-operation effort between Italy  Yugoslavia  Austria and Hungary.Nor can the European Community turn a blind  eye to its southern borders  where a gathering wave of malaise is threatening its less well endowed neighbours. By the end of this century the population on the southern shores of the Mediterranean sea win have increased by 60 million. If the Mediterranean is not to become an area of permanent instability. Europe and the African countries win have jointly to tackle the problems of trade  investment and immigration  with a view also to promoting sufficient development to root labour forces in their country of origin. We shall a11 have collectively to consider Europe's capacity to absorb poor and vulnerable foreign population  groups  to ensure that they do not end up facing a new marginalisation in our countries. Italy is already studying this question at the national level. It would be tragic to succumb to inertia in the face of the drug scourge. A long  hard war lies ahead  and the outcome is uncertain  we are fighting a faceless adversary  without uniform or frontiers  feeding a silent subterranean river of death.We must study the circuits of international finance and reconstruct the routes used to recycle the proceeds from drugs  which now exceed earnings from the sale of weapons  and we must create an international legal arena in which the judiciary and the police can operate as they would in a single country. These objectives are laid down in the United Nations Convention of December 1988. which must enter into force without delay and be implemented in full.In the meantime  we must help countries like Colombia  which  in order to uproot structures that threaten their sovereignty  have courageously decided to break the pattern of silence and complicity. Italy therefore undertakes to support the plan for a war on drugs  put forward recently by Prime Minister Manley of Jamaica. The plan provides not only for a series of measures in such areas as information  development and rehabilitation but for the creation  under United Nations auspices  of a multinational strike force to take action against drug trafficking organizations. It will also be necessary  of course  to remove the roots of the evil by providing farmers  particularly in Latin America  with the means of planting alternative crops. This applies particularly to Bolivia  Peru and Colombia. Italy is redirecting its own development co-operation  to which it is devoting increasing resources  in the light of the new forces threatening international public order. However  we feel that the resources of the United Nations in this field should be strengthened as well.If human beings are not to be overwhelmed by the destructive forces of nature  we must be mindful of Bacon's maxim ""Nature is not governed except by obeying her""  it is hard to follow this injunction after decades and even centuries of disobedience. But it would be unforgivable if environmental concerns were allowed to widen the gulf separating South and North. The Western countries  which have enjoyed the greatest production success in history  are calling for environmental measures without overlooking their own serious flaws. Nor are they unaware of the fears of the poorer countries concerning the impact of environmental measures on the pace of their own development  on their still elementary infrastructural levels and on the growth of consumption  if not their very survival.Here  too  the logic of integration must be made to prevail by the joint elaboration of a code of conduct  possibly through an international authority responsible for drawing up and implementing a new law of the environment  an initiative already planned by the European community. Nowadays it is more necessary than ever to envisage the legal definition of a new kind of crime - crime against the natural environment. Italy is organizing an international forum on the international legal aspects of the environment to be held in Siena next spring. This. we hope  will help to make the world conference on the environment and development  to he held In 1992. a success and not an occasion for new disagreements. On the question of the environment. Italy particularly wishes to foster co-operation between the Mediterranean countries  under the relevant existing plan of action  and it is also planning with Yugoslavia a commons strategy for the Adriatic. No development is possible without eliminating  or at least reducing  indebtedness - an evil which overshadows so many economies and which in Latin America threatens to reactivate the recurring cycle of fragile democracies followed by harsh military dictatorships.The Brady plan represents a political turning-point  but we must go further and reverse the unnatural flow of resources still -pouring into the richer nations from the poor countries. This flow amounted to 343 billion last year alone. Recent progress from mere debt management to debt reduction was made possible by various case-by case solutions. The conclusion of negotiations between certain countries and creditor banks confirms the merits of this strategy when reinforced by contributions from the financial institutions  whose resources must be increased to equip them for their new role.Italy intends to show the consistency of its policy by taking a further step to help the poorest nations. It will immediately waive repayment of development loans amounting to some 32 billion and will in future conduct its co-operation with those com tries exclusively by means of grants. The problem of indebtedness must be dealt with in the framework of more active participation by the developing cowries in trade  especially as we are preparing  in the Uruguay Bound  to redesign structures for the exchange not only of goods  but also of investments  services and technology  to ensure that the poorest countries play a meaningful role in the International economy. with regard to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  we feel that institutional strengthening is necessary to give the organization a political dimension and enable all to participate in a multilateral trade system  following modalities that take account of different situations and levels of development. On the more general problem of development  I feel that the time is ripe for an exercise in reflection at the highest level  in the light of the many new developments of this decade. Further consideration should be given to a new North-South meeting  adequately structured and prepared  to initiate the political dialogue eagerly awaited by the emerging countries  on a realistic and constructive basis.  The new world is not just around the corner  but if we want to start building it today we must make the United Nations the chief instrument of global integration. The Organization enables us to develop a diplomacy for the prevention and settlement of political disputes as well as a common strategy for development. It must be reinforced both as an irreplaceable channel for mediation and as a valuable means of safeguarding agreements reached. With their ever-increasing commitments  the peace-keeping forces must be strengthened  not only by securing wider participation  but also by improving the machinery for the recruitment and employment of troops.Particularly out of place in a world moving towards gradual integration are  in our opinion  such resolutions - adopted in a different climate - as the one equating Zionism with racism  we believe that that resolution should be rescinded. In United Nations bodies the influence of the southern hemisphere is sometimes felt  while in the financial institutions the counsels of the affluent world prevail  not without excessive resentment in the one case and excessive selfishness in the other. United Nations bodies would be better balanced if the Soviet Union were able to participate in international economic institutions. Also with this in view  the Western industrialized nations are contributing to reforms in that country to facilitate such participation. We also feel that an intensive dialogue in the framework of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development would help the Eastern countries towards a better understanding of the need for their progressive involvement in multilateral co-ordination.An improved balance in the structures designed with such foresight just after the Second World War will enable the United Nations to perform its role as the prime mover in international integration. Perhaps the time has also come to reappraise the relevance of existing decision-making mechanisms  including voting procedures  to new conditions and responsibilities. The problems confronting us are too complex for us to believe any longer in miraculous solutions and instant formulas. Only a partial  persevering and gradual effort inspired by the principles I have only briefly outlined can ensure that our countries  in full awareness of the tasks awaiting them  have both the courage needed at this point in history to shoulder them fully and the ability to accomplish them."
"74",3525,"JAM",44,1989,"ï»¿Just over one year ago my country  Jamaica  was devastated by one of the worst hurricanes in our history. At that time we received generous and spontaneous assistance from the international community  from a large number of individual countries  large and small  and from thousands of individuals within those countries. This assistance supplemented the heroic efforts of our own people and enabled us to repair the physical damage and resume a reasonable approximation to normal activity in a shorter time than originally seemed possible. But  even so  the structural and underlying economic damage still presents us with formidable challenges. This experience gives us a special feeling of sympathy aid solidarity with the peoples of the Eastern Caribbean  Puerto Rico and South Carolina that have recently suffered similar devastation from hurricane Hugo. We extend to them our deep and heartfelt sympathy. We have ourselves given whatever immediate help we could  particularly to our Caribbean Community partners - Montserrat  Saint Kitts and Nevis and Antigua. We stand ready to do whatever else we can. We strongly endorse the appeals to the international community to assist those countries as generously now as we ourselves were assisted in our time of need.On a happier note  Sir  we extend to you our warmest and most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. You are one of Africa's most experienced and skilled diplomats  and we therefore believe that your election augurs well for the success of our deliberations in this important session. The historical links and close fraternal relations that have existed between your country aid ours gives us a special aid particular pleasure in welcoming your leadership in these deliberations. Tb your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  of Argentina  we join previous speakers in expressing sincere appreciation for the constructive and able manner in which he presided over the affairs of the forty-third session.It is particularly significant and must give you  Sir  a special sense of gratification that your presidency of the assembly coincides with the moment when a long-awaited and long-overdue political development is taking place in southern Africa. The fact that we can look forward to the completion of Namibia's progress towards independence not only is a source of satisfaction to all those who have struggled so tirelessly and persistently against South Africa's obstinate and illegal hold over that Territory  but is a tribute to the work of the United Nations in mobilizing the world community around this issue.But we must not celebrate too soon. We have to remain vigilant to ensure that even at this late stage South Africa does not succeed in subverting the electoral and constitutional arrangements for Namibia's independence. We are deeply concerned at reports of widespread harassment  intimidation and killings of supporters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). We must continue to insist that South Africa scrupulously comply with the full implementation of resolution 435 (1978) in its original and definitive form so that the people of Namibia can participate freely and without intimidation or violence in the electoral process  under the control and supervision of the United Nations. We in Jamaica have joined with others in sending personnel to Namibia for the purpose of ensuring these objectives  and we are a part of a Commonwealth team that is now in Namibia investigating and monitoring the ongoing process. We trust that the Security Council will lend its full weight to ensure that South Africa proceeds to disband all its paramilitary and commando units  particularly Koevoet  that still threaten the implementation of orderly progress towards independence.This brings us once again to a consideration of South Africa itself and that odious blot on human civilization known as the practice and doctrine of apartheid.We must never forget  either here car anywhere else in the civilized world  that apartheid is not merely another eccentric or aberrant political system. It is both in theory and in practice a crime against humanity. Apartheid cannot be reformed? it can only be destroyed. The international community cannot  therefore  relations commitment to the eradication of apartheid  but must persist in its demand for the lifting of the state of emergency  the release of all political prisoners and detainees  including Nelson Mandela  an end to the harassment of anti-apartheid activists and  most important of all  the free and unrestricted participation of all political groups aid parties in the political life of South Africa. We look forward to the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly  in December  which will focus on apartheid and at which we must ensure that additional concrete steps are taken to increase the pressure on the South African regime to abandon apartheid in all its forms and dimensions.Jamaica was the first State to apply trade sanctions to South Africa. Since then many others have followed suit  end we remain consistent in our determination to continue to press for the ever-widening adoption of this strategy. Moreover  we believe that the extension of this strategy into the area of embargo en all forms of financial flaws is the surest way of achieving a non-violent solution to the South African situation. The fact remains  however  that not enough is being done in this regard by the major industrial countries and the major transnational corporations that have still continued to do business with South Africa. This makes it possible for the regime to continue to exist  even in the face of universal moral condemnation. The soothing words aid cosmetic gestures now coming out of Pretoria should not be mistaken for a genuine commitment by that regime to eradicate apartheid. They are primarily designed to prevent or dilute precisely the kind of effective economic pressure which the major countries and majortransnational corporations can exert upon Pretoria. Nevertheless  the fact that these words are being used and these gestures are being made does indicate that such sanctions as are in place are having soma effect. They also point to the fact that there is a significant and growing body of opinion within the white community in South Africa that recognizes both the basic immorality aid the ultimate non-viability of the system. If we are serious about ending apartheid  then this is the moment when we should seek every possible means to intensify the pressures on the regime.I now turn to look at the present situation in the region of which my country is a part - Latin America and the Caribbean. There is no doubt that at the political level considerable progress has been made towards the reduction of tensions aid the enlargement of political freedom and the democratic process. In Central America particularly  the Agreements  concluded last August by the five Central American Presidents at Tela  Honduras  have given dramatic impetus to the regional peace process  to the strengthening of the movement towards democratic pluralism aid to the establishment of political stability in that region. We note with satisfaction the arrangements which have now been finalized for the establishment of an international support and verification commission  involving the deployment of United Nations military observers  and the important step taken by the Government of Nicaragua in inviting the united Nations and other bodies to send teams of observers to monitor its own electoral process. We strongly commend the Secretary-General  who  through the skilful use of his good offices mission  has unremittingly persisted in efforts to obtain a negotiated solution to the Central American conflict.He should also take note of the fact that Haiti.  after many setbacks  appears to be heading towards a restoration of democracy  but it is still too early to be sure that this process will move smoothly to its completion. A ministerial delegation from the Caribbean Community  in which Jamaica participated  visited Haiti recently end held talks with a wide cross-section of the Haitian population in an effort to encourage this process. The announcement of a date in the next year for the holding of elections is encouraging  aid the members of the Caribbean Community have pledged to give every assistance to the Government and people of Haiti so long as we see steady progress continuing towards this objective.On the other hand  it is distressing to observe that in Panama a regressive movement away from democratic aid constitutional government was set in motion with the aborting of the elections in May of this year and with the installation of an unrepresentative puppet regime  which took office on 1 September. This melancholy picture has  however  been brightened by certain factors'  first  by the strong support expressed by all Latin American coin tries  through the Organization of American States (OAS)  for the Panamanian people in their quest for the restoration of proper democratic and constitutional government and the rule of law? secondly  by the efforts of the OAS itself; and  thirdly  by the willingness of the united States to refrain from unilateral action  and to work within the multilateral inter-American system. While these efforts have not  so far  brought the desired result  we in Jamaica believe very strongly that this is the right way to proceed and that if the efforts are persisted in  firmly and consistently  an appropriate and acceptable solution will be arrived at. In the final analysis  it is the Panamanian people who have to decide their own destiny. But the international community must give strong and appropriate support to those which seek a speedy return to constitutional government.There are  unfortunately  other areas of the world in which long-existing and seemingly intractable disputes continue not only to bring misery and insecurity to the peoples of the countries affected but also  in may instances  to create areas of tension and potential super-Power confrontation  which could threaten world peace ad security. I refer particularly  of course  to the Middle East  Afghanistan and Kampuchea. This Organization must continue its efforts in all these areas  however may disappointments ad frustrations may be experienced.There is  however  one general area in respect of which we can only express the most profound satisfaction  ad which holds out the greatest promise for the future of mankind. I refer to the notable improvement in the relations between the super-Powers  the continued progress in disarmament ad arms control  ad the developing convergence of attitudes of the countries of the Eastern and Western blocs. It would  of course  be premature to say that the bipolar world which emerged at the end of the Second World War  and which has been the dominant feature of the past 45 years of world history  is now a thing of the past. Nevertheless  there is good reason to believe that it is becoming so. For the first time  we can dare to believe that the threat of humanity's being destroyed in a nuclear confrontation between East and West will be lifted permanently  and that an era of co-operation  rather than confrontation  between the major ideological ad political systems of the world is becoming a real possibility and not just a Utopia dream.But  even as we recognize and applaud these favourable developments in the political field  we must also recognize that for the majority of mankind the current world economic situation presents a far less favourable picture. Even as the spectre of the mushroom cloud recedes from our immediate vision  there are other spectres  less instantly dramatic but perhaps just as deadly in the lag run that demand the attention of the world community. It is to these other natters that X now turn.In general economic terms  the decade of the 1980s has been a bleak and  in many cases  disastrous one for most countries of the developing world. The industrialized countries of Europe  North America and Japan have experienced steady growth  rapid technological advance and increasing affluence. By and large  however  they have tended to keep their increasing wealth to themselves - official development aid to  and capital investment in  the developing countries have declined in real terms. Indeed  debt-servicing payments  the fall in commodity prices and tine drying-up of commercial lending to the debtor countries have resulted in a massive transfer of real resources from the developing to the developed industrialized countries.It is true that a handful of developing countries - primarily in East Asia - have experienced spectacular growth and are on the threshold of graduating into developed industrial economies with huge financial surpluses and improved living standards  But for the vast majority of developing countries in Africa  Latin America  the Caribbean and West Asia the picture has been radically different. Here the picture has been  by and large  one of negative growth  declining per capita income and - what is even worse from the long-term point of view - a decline in standards and levels of education  nutrition  health care and housing. These are  of course  the essentials of human-resource development  without which no sustainable economic growth is possible. A vicious downward spiral has been created whereby  in many countries  the social fabric and political stability are increasingly threatened by a rising tide of misery.Central to this melancholy picture is the debt crisis - both a symptom and a cause of increasing impoverishment in much of the developing world. Oceans of analysis and of prescriptions have been produced on the subject of the debt crisis but there has been barely a trickle of effective action to arrive at any definitive amelioration of the problem.The debtor countries  for their part  have sought - indeed  have been obliged - to follow the path of structural adjustment. In so doing  they have increased their export volume markedly - by some 56 per cent over the decade - and have reduced their import volume by 13 per cent. But  in spite of this tremendous effort and achievement  their debt burden has not been reduced. Indeed  it has increased and is continuing to increase. Over the last three years  the external debt of developing countries has moved from 31 152 billion to 31 320 billion. For the 17 most indebted countries  the net transfer of resources to creditor countries totalled in the year 1988 alone approximately 331 billion. Moreover  the immediate effect of these structural adjustment programmes is often to exacerbate income imbalances within a national economy. This results in the highly explosive situation whereby the production of a stagnant or shrinking economy is being divided in an increasingly unequal fashion.It is clear that the debtor countries cannot get out of their predicament by their own efforts alone. It is clear also that the lending institutions - both the commercial banks and the multilateral lending agencies - are limited  in the contribution that they can make to a solution  by the imperatives of their own operational requirements and  in many instances  by their own basic rules and regulations.A much more significant contribution is required from the Governments of surplus creditor countries than they have so far been prepared to make. It is disappointing to note that yet another meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund has come and gone without any indication  from these countries  of a willingness to make the kind of response that the situation requires.The fact is that  while the creditor countries cannot be said to be comfortable with the present situation  because they recognize its long-term dangers to world trade and international stability  they are  however  not so uncomfortable as to be prepared to make the effort and incur the political risks that would be involved in their taking the kind of financial action that is required.In our view the time has come for the united Nations to take the lead in organizing a constructive dialogue leading to effective action among all the parties involved  the debtor nations  the lending institutions and the creditor countries. A special session of the General Assembly to be convened in 1990 for the purpose of focusing on international economic co-operation could provide the opportunity for such a dialogue. We believe that out of such a dialogue an agreement should emerge to establish an international debt organization funded by contributions from the creditor nations for the purpose of acquiring significant portions of outstanding sovereign debt from the commercial banks at market-determined discounts and passing on the benefit of these discounts to the debtor countries.In addition  the multilateral lending institutions should be permitted to refinance and restructure their loans so as to eliminate net transfers to them from heavily indebted countries. The debtor countries  as a condition of obtaining this relief  should be required to implement sound economic programmes that would enable them to service their reduced debt obligations and accumulate a sufficient surplus to resume the process of economic growth  social development and a more equitable sharing of the products of their economic systems. By this kind of collaborative effort  with all three parties making an appropriate contribution  there will emerge a real possibility of achieving a permanent solution to the debt crisis  thus creating expanded world trade and a healthier global environment for productive investment from which all people will benefit.If  as I have said  there is a lack of balance in the degree of seriousness with which creditor and debtor countries view the debt crisis  there are two other problems about which there can be no doubts that all countries of the world  big and small  developed and undeveloped  must share an equally urgent concern. The first of these is the safeguarding of our environment. The dangers posed to the future of the human race  and indeed to all life on this planet  by the continued pollution and degradation of the total natural environment is at last beginning to get the focus and intensity of attention that it has always deserved. While sound national environmental policies are central to any effort in this regard  there is no doubt that concerted action by the international community is also urgently required.The numerous environmental problems that are global in nature  which many countries are not equipped to tackle on their own  demand and require a multilateral response. Water and air pollution  soil erosion  waste disposal - to name just a few - all require an increasingly high level of international initiative. Such plans for international action  however  must recognize that in so far as poor developing countries are concerned  there is a causal relationship between environmental degradation  poverty  low educational levels and sheer lack of access to environmentally sound energy and other resources.The proposed 1992 conference on environment and development represents a step in the right direction towards international co-operation. We must be alert to seize the opportunity to look at all aspects of the problem and to recognize that the alleviation of the economic problems in the poorer countries of the world is an essential pre-condition for the maintenance of sound environmental practices.This is particularly evident in relation to matters such as deforestation. It is unrealistic 'co believe that people who have no access to any other source of energy to warm themselves or to cook their food will refrain from cutting down trees for firewood out of deference to the possible ecological effects of their actions in some seemingly distant future.Finally  I turn to the problem of drug abuse and drug trafficking. Mrs. Margaret Anstee  Director-General of the united Nations Office in Vienna responsible for the united Nations work on this issue  said recently about the narcotic threat: ""It is a threat striking at the foundation of civilization and places peace and security in their most fundamental sense increasingly in jeopardy"".Just a few days ago  President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia passionately and movingly described from this rostrum the mortal danger in which his country stands as a result of this increasingly dangerous scourge. There is no doubt that the drug problem has today assumed proportions that are far beyond the capacity of individual States to control. The production  illicit trafficking and distribution of narcotics have resulted in the growth of some of the most terrible criminal organizations the world has ever seen. This is not a problem that affects one or two countries. Nor is it limited to specific areas of the world. Like bizarre caricatures of transnational corporations  the drug cartels are seeking to globalise the financing  production and distribution of their products.If they succeed  Governments  judicial systems and other national institutions in one country after another will become hostage to them in a horrible game of death and destruction. Nor can responsibility be assigned only to those countries in which illegal narcotics are currently being primarily produced. There is  if anything  an even greater responsibility on those nations which provide the bulk of the consumer market and there is apparently an insatiable and escalating demand.We acknowledge the valuable work that has long been done by the United Nations in identifying the dangers of this traffic and in exploring ways for encouraging international co-operation in combating it. We express our appreciation to those Governments and individuals that have given such valuable service to the United Nations Commission on narcotic Drugs and provided leadership and guidance for the vital work being carried out by various United Nations bodies. We also acknowledge the useful legal framework to strengthen the capacity of Governments to deal with the illicit production  trafficking and use of narcotic drugs that has been provided by various United Nations conventions. The most recent  of course  was the United Nations Convention concluded in Vienna  in December 1988  which has already been signed by a large number of countries  including my own. But the harsh fact is that  notwithstanding these efforts  this problem has steadily grown to the monstrous and frightening proportions we see today.In 1986 our Secretary-General made the following statement on drug control in an address to the General Assembly: ""Further forms of co-operative international efforts my well be needed. I wonder  for example  if member States have yet adequately considered the possibility of a strengthened global involvement capability which might reduce the need for Governments to rely on other types of control.""My Government believes that it is incumbent on the Organization to accept the Secretary-General's challenge. Pursuant to this  our Prima Minister has sought and obtained the support of a number of countries in our Caribbean region  as well as others outside the region  and he will continue to canvass support for a specific proposal we shall be presenting to the General assembly at the appropriate time within the next few weeks. The proposal is for the implementation of a strategy within the united Nations system designed and structured to assist all member countries in their efforts to inhibit the use  interdict the supply and prevent the traffic within and across national boundaries of all illegal narcotic and psychotropic drugs. It is proposed that this strategy would have the following elements : first  a central intelligence-gathering operation which would collate and co-ordinate information on drug trafficking world wide  with particular emphasis on tracing financial flows from this activity; secondly  a training facility for anti-narcotic agents in both investigative and interdiction activities; thirdly  a capability to assist countries that require it in public education designed to control the demand for illicit drugs; fourthly  provision of technical assistance for the creation and maintenance of effective rehabilitation programmes for individuals who have become addicted to narcotic drugs; fifthly  assistance in the planning and administration of income substitution programmes  so as to provide alternative forms of economic activity for persons now engaged in the primary production of narcotic substances  who are often driven to this activity for lack of any other means of livelihood; sixthly  a multilateral and multisectoral unit  operating under United Nations control  consisting of specially trained paramilitary personnel who could be made available to assist countries which request such help to strengthen their own security forces in the war against the well-armed and well-funded forces that protect this illegal traffic.We believe that in the absence of such an international capability  to which individual countries can look for assistance  two dangerous possibilities exist. A number of countries will find their institutions so corrupted aid their security forces so overwhelmed that an orderly democratic society  governed by the rule of law will become impossible. The other danger is that countries so threatened may feel compelled to invite  or powerless to resist  a degree of involvement in their internal affairs by some other countries to which they are obliged to turn for assistance that will be inconsistent with their sovereignty. These are not imaginary dangers. They are very real and present threats being faced by many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.We need hardly emphasize  of course  that the establishment of such a multilateral and multisectoral unit would be based on full respect for each country's sovereignty and would be an instrument available to countries that request it - and only when they request it - and would operate entirely within the limits set by the countries themselves. We hope that this proposal will receive the support of all the members of the United Nations. We are ready and anxious to consult fully with all Member States so as to ensure that the proposed unit - and all the other elements of the strategy that I have outlined - meets such requirements as Members may see necessary  is supported by the necessary financial resources  and comes into existence as rapidly as possible. We therefore ask all Member States to work with us and our co-sponsoring Caribbean Community (CARICCM) partners to achieve a consensus that will provide an effective international answer to this grave and present danger to the international community.In closing  Jamaica reaffirms its strong commitment to the multilateral process which is enshrined in tine Charter of the United Nations. We continue to pledge our support to this Organization  an Organization which we feel represents the best hope for the future of mankind."
"75",3571,"JOR",44,1989,"ï»¿Sir  it is my pleasure to congratulate you warmly on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. This constitutes recognition both of your personal qualities and of the high esteem in which your friendly country  Nigeria  is held. I am confident that your eminent skill and wisdom will help us to achieve the best of results.I am also delighted to express our gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for his outstanding ability and activities in presiding over the forty-third session of the General Assembly.Our gratitude and appreciation also go to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his persistent endeavours and intensive efforts to promote the role of our Organization and achieve its noble objectives. I have studied the valuable annual report on the work of the Organization he has submitted for the past year  and I hope to continue working and co-operating to translate into reality the worthy principles and ideas it contains.The period since the Second World War has seen the birth of a new international order revolving around the United Nations and its Charter  which establishes the framework for co-operation and mutual understanding among its Members and calls for coexistence and constructive interaction among peoples. The practice of multilateral diplomacy is now inevitable  and it is essential that we adopt a collective approach in dealing with the problems before us.While the cold war - which we can now see is dissipating - resulted in tension and anxiety in the world  the new detente in international relations  whose effects are beginning to be felt in various spheres  particularly in disarmament and the settlement of a number of regional conflicts  has given the peoples of the world a renewed sense of relief  optimism and assurance.In addition  the United Nations - which had hitherto not been given a full opportunity to demonstrate its effectiveness - is now seeing its role revived and its confidence restored. This is the result not only of the improved international atmosphere but also of the recent success in the settlement of various regional conflicts. The Organization remains the principal forum and the most appropriate framework for attaining the mutual understanding and harmony required to confront and solve the problems of the world by means of co-operation  co-ordination and constructive dialogue among all its Members.The appearance of common challenges which transcend national boundaries has led to an increase in interest in the United Nations and the need to make use of its machinery has been confirmed. For example  environmental pollution  the world-wide shortage of food  the narcotics trade and international economic instability are all problems no single State is capable of solving on its own. Common international efforts are needed in this respect. Hence interdependence has become one of the most outstanding features of contemporary international relations.Faith in the role and significance of the United Nations is precisely what makes us place so much hope in the Organization and have recourse to it  both to solve conflicts and to co-ordinate our efforts to deal with the various challenges transcending regional boundaries.Our agenda includes a large number of conflicts and challenges which  we hope  we shall be able to address  but the Arab-Israeli conflict  at the core of which is the question of Palestine  remains the most serious and the one most urgently requiring solution.The world is now aware that the question of Palestine is indeed at the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arab people are pivotal to that question. Jordan has lived with the question of Palestine since its inception  has been affected by it and has undertaken much in the process. Jordan's objective in its endeavours to address the question has been  and continues to be  to achieve a just peace settlement guaranteeing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and security and stability in the Middle East and enhancing international peace and security.Jordan has always maintained that a political settlement of the Palestinian question is the only option of the parties. Accordingly  through co-ordination with Arab States  consultation with the major Powers and co-operation with the United Nations  it has striven to attain a comprehensive and just agreement rooted in international legitimacy. It has therefore responded to the peace initiatives proposed in connection with the question and accepted the pertinent international resolutions. It took part in the efforts to ensure the adoption of Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which states that land may not be acquired by means of war  insists on the need for Israel to withdraw from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  and affirms the right of all States in the region to live in peace within internationally recognized borders. Jordan also accepted SecurityCouncil resolution 338 (1973)  which served to complement resolution 242 (1967)  particularly by calling on the parties to negotiate within an international framework.Jordan also responded to the development in the Arab community in 1974 endorsing the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. A move in this direction had already been made with its announcement of the United Arab Kingdom project in 1972  as a preliminary conception under which to assert the identity of the Palestinian people  to forge its national entity and to define the future relationship between Palestine and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  based on the principle of union and assertion of the independent Palestinian identity. Jordan also accepted the 1982 Arab peace plan for a balanced peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.As a result of the intensive efforts undertaken by His Majesty King Hussein of Jordan  the Arab States reached a unanimous agreement at the Amman summit conference in 1987 to the effect that the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the already agreed modalities  constituted the appropriate means to achieve a comprehensive and just peaceful settlement of the conflict such as to guarantee the restoration of the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  to enable the Palestinian people to exercise its inalienable national rights  including the right to establish its own independent State on its national soil  to solve all aspects of the Palestinian question and to ensure the right of all States in the region to live in peace within internationally recognized borders.There have been highly significant positive developments in the Palestinian question over the past two years  to the extent that a historic opportunity now exists for the attainment of a comprehensive political settlement. By its persistence and momentum  the intifadah has been successful in moving Palestinian political action into a position of initiative and taking action. Jordan's decision to sever its legal and administrative links with the occupied West Bank on 3] July 1988  in response to the request of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the wishes of fraternal Arab States  came as a positive contribution in this direction and made all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict directly aware of their responsibilitiesThe Palestinian leadership began its positive action by calling for a meeting of the Palestine National Council at Algiers at the end of last year. That meeting produced a series of positive resolutions which were characterized by realism and moderation and removed the obstacles to a peace settlement and the pretexts on which Israel had taken refuge since the June 1967 aggression. The positive Palestinian position met with broad international acclaim and led to the initiation of a Palestinian-United States dialogue  which we hope will develop and continue in order that the peace process may be brought to its desired conclusion.Accordingly  we continue to believe that the right way to bring about peace is to convene the International Conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all the parties involved  including the Palestine Liberation Organization and with the presence of the five permanent members of the Security Council  on the basis of Security Council resolution 242 (1967) and of all other United Nations resolutions relating to the rights of the Palestinian people and to the Arab-Israeli conflict.We believe that the United Nations  and its Charter and resolutions  provide the natural and appropriate framework in which to bring about a settlement  and that the five permanent members of the Council must exert their influence to achieve this objective  for they bear a special responsibility under the Charter.What is required of them  now that the Arab position has been rounded out by acceptance of the International Peace Conference  is that they should endeavour to persuade Israel to comply with the will of the international community by breaking out of the circle of violence and oppression and opting for a state of security  stability and constructiveness. For Israel cannot hope to win both land and peace. If Israel persists in its present policy  it will only cause more suffering and instability. Meanwhile  its attempts to outflank and circumvent the achievements of the Palestinian people by clinging to incomplete proposals such as the Shamir election plan will not be of benefit to anyone.We therefore consider it absolutely essential that every nation - particularly those that are capable of exercising influence - exert a genuine effort to make Israel comply with international law  respect the will of the international community  and accept a just and comprehensive peace settlement through a dialogue between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization  in preparation for the direct negotiations that will take place at the International Peace Conference on the Middle East. In this connection  we see the efforts of the President of Egypt  His Excellency Mohamed Hosni Mubarak - particularly the 10 points that he has proposed in order to break the deadlock in the peace process - as an opportunity that should not be missed by Israel. Israel's response to these efforts will be a real test of its desire for peace.As I said at the beginning of my statement  the Arab-Israeli conflict is not the only problem afflicting the Middle East. Much as we welcome the positive developments in the Iraq-Iran conflict since last year's cease-fire  and the inclination to bring about peace through direct negotiations as a fundamental means to which the two parties are committed for the settlement of all aspects of the conflict  we express today our profound concern and unease at the present deadlock and at the deliberate decision of Iran to delay the progress of negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the purpose of implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1987) and the agreement of 8 August 1988. This attitude has been adopted by Iran despite Iraq's flexible and responsible attitude since the outbreak of the conflict and its sincere desire to reach an agreement that would preserve the rights of both parties  guarantee good-neighbourliness between them  and establish security and stability for all States in the region. In the light of this situation  steps must be taken towards resumption of direct negotiations between the two parties  in order that they may move forwardfrom the current cease-fire to a state of lasting and comprehensive peace  by implementing Security Council resolution 598 (1987) as an integrated peace plan  leading eventually to a peace agreement by which the two sides will undertake to respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity and not to intervene in each other's internal affairs.If Iraq and the other Arab countries look historically upon Iran as a friendly neighbour  it is up to the Iranian side to demonstrate the same spirit and to show the same attachment to peace. The fact that Iraq has demobilized recently five military divisions of its armed forces is a true indication of this trend  and we hope that Iran will act in the same way. Urgent action must also be taken to end the suffering of prisoners of war  who  under international conventions  should not be used as a means of exerting political pressure. Attention must be given to the provisions of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 also.The Lebanese tragedy has assumed dimensions that make it impossible to keep silent. The ordeals  killing and destruction that the Lebanese have undergone have exceeded all bounds. Foreign threats and intervention in Lebanon have also reached a dangerous level. In view of its concern for Lebanon and for that country's independence and unity  Jordan has taken part in every Arab effort  and has also supported international efforts  to end the Lebanese tragedy. The last such effort consisted of the formation of the Tripartite Committee of Arab Heads of State  in which the Arab States placed their trust  and at which they expressed their wishes for the identification of an Arab solution to the tragedy. We endorse the steps that the Committee has taken and the progress that it has made up to now. It is for the various parties to take advantage of the meeting of Lebanese deputies in the city of Taif  Saudi Arabia  the prevailing good will  and current positive conditions.It is also vital that the United Nations - particularly the five permanent members of the Security Council - persist in their efforts to help save Lebanon  by prevailing upon Israel to implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and ensuring its withdrawal from Lebanese territory. Such an approach is essential  as support will thus be provided for the related Arab effort  and added weight given to endeavours to restore Lebanon's independence and control over all its territory.The fact that the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia came into effect on 1 April 1989 is a source of satisfaction to us all. It represents a victory both for the struggling people of Namibia and for the South West Africa People's Organization and testifies to the effectiveness of the United Nations. We hope that the remaining stages of the plan - particularly the elections to be held next month - will be implemented in peace and without delay  in order that the people of Namibia may be enabled to exercise self-determination  establish their own State and decide their own future. We look forward to Namibia's joining us shortly as an independent  sovereign State.At the same time  we urge that international efforts be combined to induce South Africa to abolish the system of apartheid prevailing in that country - representing  as it does  a stigma of shame  which has to be eliminated.We welcomed the peace agreement that was successfully concluded last year between the parties involved in the Afghan problem. In welcoming the completion of the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan  we hope that all the parties will be able to agree and to show mutual understanding in order that the problem may finally be settled by means of national reconciliation that preserves Afghanistan's independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status and ensures that Afghan refugees can return to their homes. We support the independence  unity  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus and welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to solve the question of Cyprus in such a way as to fulfil the hopes of both communities of the Cypriot people for a solution of their problems and to establish a suitable formula for peaceful coexistence in accordance with the shared wishes of that people. We urge both parties to maintain constructive dialogue and to take advantage of the Secretary-General's worthy efforts in this connection.With regard to the Kampuchean problem  we support action to bring about a comprehensive political settlement  on the basis of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  non-interference in their internal affairs  and the eight of peoples to self-determination without outside intervention. We do so in view of the positive effects that such a settlement will have in the South-East Asian region as a whole. We appreciate the intensive efforts of the Association of South-East Asian Nations to that end. We also welcome the fact that Viet Nam has completed the withdrawal of its forces from Kampuchea  and hope that this constitutes the start of a new phase to be characterized by peace  constructiveness and co-operation in Kampuchea and in the region as a whole.We also support the admission of the two Koreas to the United Nations  as that would enhance the chances of national unity for the Korean people  promote peace and stability in the region  and uphold the principle of universality on which this international Organization was founded.We hope that the nations of Central America will be able to solve their political and security problems and devote the efforts to promoting the welfare and prosperity of their peoples. In this they should be guided by the Esquipulas II accords and the subsequent agreements and declarations  the latest of which was concluded at Tela  Honduras  this past August.One of the highest priorities of our world today is the process of nuclear and conventional disarmament. This requires good faith and genuine endeavours. Although action in that direction is the joint responsibility of all  the States with massive arsenals of such weapons bear special responsibility. In this connection  we were especially encouraged by the INF Treaty concluded by the two super-Powers in December 1987  on the elimination of their intermediate-range nuclear missiles. We were similarly heartened by the latest proposals formulated by the United States and the Soviet Union on the reduction or destruction of their stocks of chemical  strategic and conventional weapons  as well as on the halting of nuclear testing. The improvement in the international climate resulting from better relations between the two super-Powers has generated relief and given rise to a sense of optimism in the world. We hope that efforts will be accelerated so that the disarmament process  in all its aspects  may continue to make serious progress towards general and comprehensive disarmament in the world.In this context  we cannot but voice once again our concern over Israel's nuclear arms build-up  which has heightened tension in our region and ushered in a phase of grave danger. Israel is the only State in the Middle East that refuses to submit its nuclear facilities to the International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards system and to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Israel's arsenal of strategic weapons is growing. The latest addition is its recently developed missile which was tested a few days ago in the Mediterranean.In order for the improvement in East-West relations to become a basic step towards the creation of an appropriate international climate  it must be accompanied by an improvement in international economic relations and movement towards the creation of a more balanced and equitable economic order.The economic gap between the developed and the developing countries  and the problems of indebtedness and poverty are but the outcome of the imbalances inherent in the present international economic order. The developing countries cannot succeed in their efforts to raise their peoples' standard of living unless collective solutions are found for these problems. In this connection  we welcome the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly scheduled for next April on international economic co-operation and  in particular  the revitalization of economic growth and development in developing countries.As we prepare for the formulation of an international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and the convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  we hope that concerted efforts will be made towards the formulation of solutions to these problems in a manner that will ensure positive benefits for all - not just for some.We believe in the importance of revitalizing the North-South dialogue in pursuit of positive results in the areas of economics  development and the environment. In this connection  we endorse the Quadripartite initiative announced by the leaders of Egypt  India  Senegal and Venezuela in Paris last July concerning the need for regular consultations between leaders of the North aid the South on such problems.Believing as we do in Jordan that the strengthening of relations between States - particularly in the economic sphere - creates a better climate of harmony and co-operation that reflects favourably on other areas  and taking into account contemporary world trends towards the creation of economic groupings that provide the members of such groups with better opportunities to protect their interests and achieve economic development and progress  we - together with our brethren in the Arab Republic of Egypt  the Republic of Iraq and the Yemen Arab Republic - set up the Arab Co-operation Council last February. We are confident that this economic grouping - whose purposes and principles are consistent with those of the United Nations Charter - will help  together with the Gulf Co-operation Council and the Arab Maghreb Union  to promote joint Arab economic action  and thereby make a positive contribution towards the promotion of international economic co-operation.Jordan firmly believes in the inevitability of reaching solutions to the problems of today's world if the necessary political will is shown. Our world is large enough to embrace different beliefs and persuasions  but it is too small to accommodate all the conflicts and lethal weapons made by man. Mankind has reached a stage of evolution  civilization and maturity that makes progress the only option open to us. So let us work together for a fairer  more harmonious end more open human community that will furnish the basis for a more secure  stable and prosperous world. This can be achieved only through a sincere desire for peace and through faith in the shared interests and common destiny of mankind. We should continue our common efforts in an atmosphere of constructive co-operation and positive dialogue within the framework of the United Nations. Let us remain ever mindful of the lofty principles and noble goals of our international Organization  and fill our hearts with optimism in the auspicious atmosphere that reigns in this session."
"76",3618,"JPN",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like first  on behalf of the Government and people of Japan  to express ây heartfelt congratulations to you  Ambassador Garba  on your election as President of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  I am confident that your wealth of experience and keen insight will ensure that this will be a very productive session. You may be assured that the Japanese delegation will be unstinting co-operating with you as you carry out your solemn responsibilities.At the same time  I express my sincere respect for the many outstanding accomplishments of Mr. Caputo during his tenure as President of the forty-third session. Founded with the maintenance of world peace as its most important objective  the United Nations has played a very positive role in resolving many issues that have confronted the international community. Most recently its efforts to effect Namibia's transition to independence and its guest for a peaceful solution to the Central American conflict have earned it world-wide praise and high expectations as to the success of its future endeavours. Indeed  success has restored the authority of the United Nations  a situation I sincerely welcome. Underlying the enhancement of these United Nations activities for world peace have been major changes in the state of international relations. Yet success would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of the United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and others concerned. On this occasion I convey to them my profound respect and appreciation.The international community is today in the midst of a major transition from discord to dialogue  from conflict to co-operation. We are entering upon a new era  in which we must confront the global challenges of bringing about lasting solutions to regional conflicts  sustaining prosperity  preserving the environment  and building a society based solidly on respect for human rights.Looking first at relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  we are pleased to see dialogue taking root and expanding in a diversity of realms. In particular  we welcome the latest round of talks that was held just last week and look forward to further progress in that dialogue. In Europe we see progress being made in talks on conventional forces and on confidence- and security-building measures. Sino-Soviet relations have been normalized. Determined efforts are being made for reform in many of the socialist countries. All of these are welcome developments. The positive changes in East-West relations have also given new impetus to the drive to negotiate peaceful solutions to regional issues and regional conflicts. In addition to the transition to independence in Namibia and the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Central America  the effort to achieve peace in Cambodia entered a new stage with the holding of the International Conference in Paris this summer.However  while a start has been made in resolving regional conflicts and stabilizing these areas  the achievement of a comprehensive solution to any of these issues will not be easy. Although foreign troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan and a cease-fire has been implemented between Iran and Iraq  it cannot be said that these areas are truly at peace. Likewise  on the issue of peace in the Middle East  even though there have been some new developments  substantive progress has yet to be made. The situation in Lebanon is also very worrisome.  As for the Asian region  some developments in line with the new thinking in the Soviet Union are discernible in  for example  the Sino-Soviet relationship the situation in Cambodia  and the Afghan problem  m the light of these developments  Japan hopes further to strengthen and expand the political dialogue being actively pursued with the Soviet Union and realize a genuine improvement in the bilateral relationship  including the resolution of the Northern Territories issue. I would stress that  beyond improving Japan-Soviet relations  this would constitute an important step towards enhancing peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and improving East-West relations as a whole.Recent events in China stunned the world and had a strong impact on the feelings of the Japanese people toward China. Nevertheless  Japan's expectations for China's policy of reform and opening up to the outside world remain unchanged  and I hope that the Chinese Government will pay due heed to world opinion and strive to regain the confidence of the international community.A new era is also dawning in the quest for global prosperity. The world economy is generally experiencing satisfactory growth  and the newly industrializing economies are achieving remarkable levels of development. Further  all the countries concerned are making a determined effort to see that negotiations in the Uruguay Round achieve substantive results by the end of 1990. Japan will continue to strive to ensure that progress is made in these negotiations. Yet  when we look at the world economy as a whole  it is clear that there are still a number of problems standing in the way of sound world economic development  not the least of which are the persistent massive external imbalances and the threat of protectionist pressures  the deteriorating economic situation in the world's poorest countries  including those in Africa  and the enormous burden of debt in countries of Latin America and other parts of the world.At the same time  we are faced with the stark reality of an accelerating threat to the global environment  the soundness of which is an absolute prerequisite for the prosperity of the world. Moreover  human rights continue to be abused and there are still massive exoduses of refugees in many parts of the world. All of these are international concerns that demand the attention of the entire international community.In the context of these changes  as Japan interacts with the rest of the world more intensively and in a broader spectrum of fields  it realizes that it must play a more active role in international affairs. Early this year  we were honoured by the many envoys from all over the world who came to Japan to pay their condolences at the time of Emperor Showa's funeral. I wish on this occasion to express  on behalf of the Government of Japan  my profound gratitude. That experience has made us all the more keenly aware of the importance of Japan's international role. With the aim of contributing to a better world  Japan has launched an International Co-operation Initiative to foster world peace and prosperity. The three elements of the Initiative are: strengthening Japan's co-operation as it actively participates and co-operates in the effort to establish and sustain world peace; expanding its official development assistance to contribute to growth in developing countries! and strengthening international cultural exchange to encourage greater understanding among the different cultures of the world. Expanding upon this Initiative  Japan is also devoting its attention to the environment and other global issues. The Kaifu Administration  which was formed in August of this year  is developing an activist foreign policy stance as one of its major objectives  and is determined to do everything in its power to create a world of peace andprosperity  and an international community that is more just and more responsive to human needs.I should like next to say a few words about the role of the United Nations and Japan's contribution to it in the light of its position as I have just outlined it.If we are to achieve and maintain world peace and stability it is imperative that we find fundamental solutions to the regional conflicts and regional problems that even today are taking countless lives and causing immense suffering across the globe. Although first steps have been taken towards settling these conflicts  comprehensive solutions have yet to be achieved  and in many instances efforts are now at a crucial stage.looking at the decade-long conflict in Cambodia  the recent Paris conference offered an historic opportunity for the parties directly involved  and other interested countries  to assemble for intensive discussions and negotiations. While the conference did not result in a comprehensive political settlement  and no agreement was reached on the establishment of an international control mechanism  there were a number of significant developments  including the dispatch of a fact-finding team  as suggested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We believe it is imperative for everyone concerned to make an even greater effort to ensure that true peace is restored to Cambodia. I very much hope that this session of the General Assembly will provide added momentum towards peace in Cambodia.It should be noted that international control remains important at every stage of the peace process in Cambodia. The mechanism for international control should be truly universal and fair  should possess a wide range of experience and expertise  and should have the support of and access to a broad range of human and financial resources  lb understand this is to realize that such a mechanism must be established within the framework of the United Nations.As an Asian neighbour  Japan has stated clearly its intention seriously to consider providing necessary financial cooperation  personnel  refugee repatriation assistance  and other support for the establishment of an international control mechanism to help settle the Cambodian problem  the major cause of instability in the region. In addition  Japan has proposed that an international reconstruction committee be established to provide the international framework for Cambodia's recovery once peace has been restored. I am pleased that this proposal was accepted in principle at the recent international conference. Japan is determined to cooperate with the other countries concerned and to continue its steadfast efforts for the ultimate attainment of a comprehensive political settlement.As regards the Angola-Namibian issue  I very much welcome the fact that  with last December's tripartite agreement  progress has been made towards resolving the problems in Angola  and genuine progress continues to be made in the process of Namibia's transition to independence. Namibian independence has great historical and symbolic significance as it marks the attainment of the objective of decolonisation on the African continent. The United Nations is now making an Organization-wide effort to ensure that this transition goes smoothly  an effort that has won broad international acclaim. This is the sort of effort that only the United Nations can undertake  and is a further demonstration of the useful role it can play. Consistent with its desire to co-operate for peace  Japan is providing about 30 people to take part in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group monitoring the constituent assembly elections scheduled for this November.In Afghanistan  civil war continues  and the situation remains a source of deep concern. Japan believes that the establishment of a broad-based government reflecting the popular will is absolutely essential to the attainment of true stability in that country. Japan is therefore cooperating actively by making contributions through the Office of the United Nations Coordinator for Afghanistan and by providing personnel needed for medical assistance and infrastructural improvements to facilitate the repatriation of Afghan refugees. It does so in the hope that peace will be restored to Afghanistan as soon as possible through the determined efforts of the Afghan people themselves to resolve their problems and that the refugees will soon be able to return to their country safely and with honour.Turning to the Iran-Iraq conflict  Japan highly appreciates the maintenance of the cease-fire through the presence of the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group. However  even one year after the implementation of the cease-fire  the peace negotiations have yet to bear fruit. I very much hope that both sides will approach these negotiations with determination and flexibility so that a comprehensive peace can be achieved in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987). Japan will continue to give its full support to the Secretary-General's mediation efforts and will extend all possible cooperation for the settlement of this conflict.Although there have been a number of noteworthy initiatives since the Congress of the Palestine National Council met late last year  including the proposal for elections in the occupied territories  I cannot but be concerned by the lack of  substantive progress in the Middle East peace process. As the intifadeh continues  the situation in the occupied territories deteriorates further. I wish to pay a high tribute to the ongoing and determined efforts of the parties concerned towards the prompt achievement of a just  lasting and comprehensive peace  I strongly hope that their efforts will result in a concrete plan. In support of the efforts of the parties concerned to achieve peace  Japan intends to step up its high-level political dialogue with the Arab countries concerned  the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel. At the same time  it is seeking to expand its assistance to the Palestinian people. We must not turn our back on the situation in Lebanon. I very much hope that the parties concerned will exercise maximum restraint  and that a way will be found to end the fighting and to achieve national reconciliation. In this regard  I pay a high tribute to the activities of the League of Arab States and particularly to the Tripartite Committee. Resolutely opposed to all forms of terrorism  hostage-taking  and other inhumane acts  Japan strongly appeals for the immediate release of all hostages.South Africa's system of racial discrimination is intolerable  and must be completely dismantled without delay. I sincerely hope that the new Government established in that country will take concrete and effective steps to abolishapartheid. For its part  Japan will continue to co-operate with the rest of the international community in pressing South Africa to lift the state of emergency  release Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners  legalize the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations  aid promptly initiate dialogue with representatives of various sectors of the black population. At the same time  Japan is actively supporting the victims of South African apartheid and is extending assistance to the other countries of southern Africa. In Central America  we welcome the progress that has been made in the peace process  with the United Nations playing a role in line with the agreement reached at the meeting of the presidents of the five Central American countries. As part of its support for the Organization's activities  Japan is prepared to provide personnel for the United Nations elections-monitoring commission for the generalelections scheduled to take place in Nicaragua next February. Japan is also considering what form of co-operation it can extend in the security verification mechanism and other areas.The issue of the Korean peninsula is primarily one to be settled peacefully through direct dialogue between the authorities of the South and of the North. Japan hopes that progress will be made in constructive and substantive South-North dialogue. It has a high regard for the vigorous efforts that the Republic of Korea has made towards that end since 7 July 1988  when President Roh Tae Wbo issued the Special Declaration in the Interest of National Self-esteem  Unification and Prosperity. The exchanges between the Republic of Korea and various Socialist countries that are taking place in the wake of last year's Seoul Olympics are to be encouraged as a means of relaxing tensions on the peninsula.In the light of this new situation  Japan is working to improve relations with North Korea  with due regard for maintaining the international political balance. Japan hopes to contribute to the creation of a climate conducive to dialogue between South Korea and North Korea. Moreover  we would welcome and support United Nations membership for South and North  whether simultaneous or separate  as an interim measure towards the goal of unification of the peninsula. This would also enhance the universality of the United Nations.As we have seen  the United Nations has played an important role in settling regional conflicts around the globe  especially in the peace-keeping field. Yet the United Nations mission to prevent and eliminate the threat of conflicts is ju3t as important as its peace-keeping operations are once conflict has broken out. Even when prevention proves impossible  efforts must be made to settle a conflict before it on escalate. Last year the Declaration on the prevention of disputes  which was jointly proposed by Japan and five other countries  was adopted by the General Assembly  while recognizing the roles to be played by Member States  the Security Council and the General Assembly  the Declaration calls on the Secretary-General to approach directly the countries concerned  when necessary  in an effort to prevent conflict and to consider sending fact-finding missions to regions where conflict is imminent.Japan is determined to extend all possible co-operation to settle regional conflicts in all parts of the world and to the United Nations peace-making and Peace-keeping activities. Very broadly speaking  Japan's co-operation for peace is grounded in the following four principles. First  in addition to supporting fully the Secretary-General's peace-making initiatives  Japan focuses its diplomatic efforts on extending all possible co-operation for the settlement of regional conflicts.  Secondly  Japan is striving to extend as much financial support as possible to United Nations peace-keeping activities  and will strengthen its co-operation by providing personnel in areas where a Japanese role would be appropriate. Just as  in the past  it has extended voluntary contributions as circumstances demanded this August  made a contribution towards the establishment of a fund to strengthen peace-keeping activities so that new peace-keeping aerations may be initiated without delay once the settlement of a regional conflict is reached. I f call upon other member States to support this fund.Thirdly  Japan is determined to strengthen its support for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other forms of relief extended to people made refugees by regional conflicts in various parts of the world.Fourthly  Japan provides all possible co-operation after a conflict has been a solved so that the land and economy of the country ravaged by war may be restored a d the lives of the people stabilized and improved. Arms control and disarmament is an issue critically important to the preservation of lasting world peace and stability. Japan is making ever greater g forts in this regard  in recognition of the fact that world peace is essential to 2- ; own security.Japan welcomes the progress being made in the strategic arms reduction talks between the United States and the Soviet Union  and in the negotiations on forces in Europe  and hopes that it will contribute to a further stabilization of East-West relations. In the United Nations  in the Conference on D -armament  and in other multilateral disarmament efforts  significant progress h been made towards a chemical weapons ban. In an effort to conclude such a Comprehensive ban promptly  the countries concerned continued to negotiate at the Paris Conference last January and  again  at the International (? eminent-Indus try Conference against Chemical Weapons held this month inCanberra. I express my high appreciation of the initiative towards the global elimination of chemical weapons outlined yesterday by President Bush. Encouraging  too  are the serious efforts that are continuing in the nuclear disarmament field in preparation for next year's review of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Mi clear Weapons.Appropriate verification measures are essential to the attainment of effective arms control and disarmament  and in recent years greater ingenuity has been called for in this area. Pooling all of its technical capabilities  Japan is taking the initiative in the establishment of an international test verification network for the nuclear test ban. Also  it has drawn upon its position as a country having a sophisticated chemicals industry to make constructive proposals for the establishment of means of verification of a ban on chemical weapons.Consistent with those disarmament efforts  Japan acted as host to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament Issues this April in Kyoto. The Conference was highly successful in contributing to an enhanced awareness of the need for an international nuclear test verification network and in reaffirming the complementary nature of United States-Soviet disarmament efforts and the multilateral disarmament efforts being made in the United Nations and other forums. Japan is second to none in the co-operation it extends to international efforts for arms control and disarmament in the United Nations and in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.To achieve the sustained prosperity of the international community  we must work for growth in developing countries. It is imperative that all countries co-operate by taking a global perspective. So far  Japan has systematically enhanced its overseas development assistance and contributed vigorously to supporting and strengthening the economic development and adjustment efforts of developing countries. At present  Japan is making a determined effort to meet its fourth mid-term target. At the same time  Japan decided this July to expand its programme of recycling no less than $US 30 billion over a three-year period starting in 1987  to become a programme of recycling at least $US 65 billion over a five-yea  period starting in 1987. Seeking to support the new strategy on the debt of developing countries  Japan is working to earmark a total of at least $US 10 billion of this enhanced capital recycling programs for untied capital support to countries eligible for this debt strategy.Special consideration should be directed to the plight of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere  given that they face increasingly harsh difficulties as a result  inter alia  of sluggish commodity markets  slow growth  trade deficits and snowballing debt. Japan has announced that  in addition to the total of approximately $us 500 million in non-project grant capital assistance that it is currently disbursing  it is prepared to provide a total of about 3US 600 million in the three-year period starting in 1990  to support the efforts of these countries to restructure their economies. At the same time  starting this fiscal year  Japan is taking additional measures and is implementing grant assistance for debt relief  on past yen credits extended to the least developed countries  of approximately $us 5.5 billion in principal.I should like to emphasize the important role the United Nations and related organizations play in the development of developing countries  in addition to continuing its support for United Nations operational activities such as the United Nations Development Programme  Japan intends to take an active part in the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries and the preparations for an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade  all of which are scheduled for next year.Mankind is today at an epochal turning point. The invention of the steam engine in the late eighteenth century completely transformed the social and economic structures that had been developed through the course of human history. From the nineteenth century to the middle of the present century  the pace of technological advance accelerated with the development of synthetic chemicals and progress in nuclear engineering  petro-chemistry and materials and electronic engineering  and society rode an unbroken wave of development. Flushed with that success  we turned our gaze outward towards space  downward to develop the technology to explore the ocean floor and  finally  inward to biotechnology with its promise to unlock the secrets of life. At the same time  rapid advances in communications satellites have made possible the real-time exchange of information and image-reception everywhere  making the world a single informational global village.These dramatic scientific and technological advances offer unlimited potential for the solution of the problems confronting mankind. If we are to realize that potential we must make constant progress in basic scientific fields. The promotion of joint international research through the exchange of scientists and the exchange and transfer of technology will be important in effectively mobilizing financial and human resources in those fields.  On the other hand  it has been demonstrated that if the dramatic expansion of economic activity which is an outgrowth of scientific advance were to proceed in a way that would destroy the balance in the planet's ecosystem the global damage weald be irrevocable . In just these past 30 years - the blink of an eye in the vast continuum of history - during which mankind has ventured to the far reaches of space and has sought to explore the oceans- depths  there has been an ominous acceleration in the pace of environmental destruction. The health of the planet is gravely threatened by global warming  the destruction of the ozone layer  the depletion of tropical rain forests  acid rain and desertification. The global environmental problems that confront us today must be dealt with by the entire international community working together. Our generation has a solemn responsibility to preserve the natural beauty around us and rebuild a healthy global environment so as to secure the future of coming generations.The protection of the natural environment so as to enable all people  regardless of where they live  to lead   comfortable and healthy life is a Prerequisite for the prosperity of the international community. The effects of such problems as environmental destruction  explosive population growth and natural disasters transcend national boundaries and  as problems common to all mankind  present a global challenge to the international community. This is an area where the united Nations  as the international community's most universal organization  must bring all its authority to bear.Is it not incumbent upon the international commit  today to act quickly and in a concerted manner to take better care of our global environment so as to ensure the continued prosperity of our children and our children's children? Japan believes that should be done by adhering to the following four principles  first  preservation of the global environment while working to attain stable world economic growth; secondly  emphasis on the importance of scientific knowledge as fundamental to the protection of the global environment  thirdly  the imperative of a global response to problems* and  fourthly  due consideration of the situation of developing countries.Japan has long focused its attention on environmental problems. In accordance with the principles I just outlined  and co-operating multilaterally and bilaterally  Japan intends to mobilize all its scientific and technical capabilities  its experience and its knowledge vigorously to address global environmental problems. As part of those efforts  Japan will continue to support the activities of such international organizations as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the International Tropical Timber Organization and will aim to increase the aggregate sum of its official development assistance for environmental efforts to approximately 300 billion yen over the next three years.Further  earlier this month Japan  in co-operation with UNEP  was host in Tokyo to a conference on the global environment. Constructive scientific discussions were held  and recommendations were formulated on the question of what to do about such atmospheric changes as global warming and on the relationship between development and the environment in developing countries. Among the results were the suggestion  made for the first time  of a maximum permissible limit on carbon dioxide emissions and recommendations on measures that both developed and developing countries should take. I believe those recommendations will serve as important guidelines for discussions at this session of the General Assembly and for international efforts prior to the 1992 United Nations conference on the environment and development. Japan  for its part  intends to take part seriously in those endeavours.A variety of measures must be taken to protect the global environment  and a number of organizations within the United Nations system are implementing meaningful programmes. I believe these international efforts should be further Promoted in an efficient and well co-ordinated manner. Accordingly  I should like to propose that the General Assembly conduct in-depth discussions on measures to enable the United Nations to strengthen policy coordination on global environmental problems throughout the United Nations system. Mitigating the impact of natural disasters is another important objective in the overall effort to preserve the environment for life on this planet. As a country which has taken initiatives in this area  Japan feels particularly gratified that the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction will commence next year. Japan intends to extend technical cooperation and to assist in strengthening activities which would enhance public awareness with respect to the reduction of natural disasters. I should like to take this opportunity to appeal for active participation by all countries in co-operating in this important area.Along with the preservation of the natural environment  it is important that we create and maintain a social climate in which people everywhere can live without fear  in which their basic rights and freedoms are guaranteed  and in which they can live in health and dignity. Consequently  the international community cannot but be very concerned about the continuing abuses of human rights and the outflows of refugees in every part of the world. The drug problem and international terrorism are likewise very serious international problems. The resolution of global humanitarian problems  the creation of a society respectful of human rights  and the establishment of truly universal values are precisely the global challenges for which the United Nations should mobilize the cooperation of its Member States and international organizations so it can play a more effective role. In the conviction that international co-operation is essential for the solution of the drug and other problems  Japan intends to participate vigorously in United Nations activities in those areas.There has recently been a succession of landings by boat people on the shores of Japan  and  while it very much hopes that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  other international agencies and the countries concerned can do something to resolve this problem  Japan will make available  to the best of its ability  financial co-operation  resettlement accommodations and other assistance consistent with its long-standing practices.International co-operation in the medical field is likewise important if we are to create a society in which all people enjoy a healthy and rewarding life. Thanks to the efforts of the World Health Organization (WHO)  and with the co-operation of every country  smallpox  that scourge of mankind  has been eradicated. And now the world-wide spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clearly demonstrates once again that global co-operation is essential for the prevention and medical treatment of infectious diseases.Japan has enriched the field of advanced medical technology  combining its knowledge of modern Western medicine with its experience with its own traditional medical science. It has also achieved a society whose members enjoy the greatest average longevity in the world. Japan intends to contribute its scientific know-how  information  technology and experience  both in the form of multilateral co-operation through WHO  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other organizations  and in the form of cooperative bilateral efforts in order to enhance co-operation in such areas as public hygiene  the prevention of epidemics  health education and dissemination of primary health care  as well as clinical medicine and research.As we enter this age of dramatic change  it is only right that the focus and priorities of United Nations activities should likewise change. The goal of the administrative and fiscal reforms no  being pursued is to enable the United Nations to remake itself into a more effective Organization  one better able to respond to the changes in the international community  by moving away from issues that have lest their urgency and mobilizing its human and financial resources to meet the new global challenges. Thanks to the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General and everyone else concerned  the three-year programme for administrative and fiscal reform will be brought to a conclusion at the end of this year. But this should not be the end of our longer-term efforts to make the United Nations more effective and flexible. Any organization that hopes to avoid stagnation and gain resilience must continually strive for self-renewal. I believe that all Member states should give these efforts to re-invigorate the United Nations their total support. Japan has worked hard to build a country of peace and freedom  in keeping with the national goal of creating an international society in which people everywhere can live in peace  free from fear and want. The United Nations  indispensable as the only truly universal organization we have  has shown the way by illuminating the ideals of such a society. Yet it must be noted that even the United Nations  despite the expansion of its activities and its many achievements in  for example  humanitarian relief and operational activities since its founding in 1945  has at times been forced to retreat from these lofty ideals  at times appearing disengaged or powerless in the face of a difficult international situation. Nevertheless  the true worth of any  organization or agency is determined by the will and attitudes of its members.In that sense the United Nations is an accurate reflection of the international community. It is the will and attitudes of its Member States that determine how the United Nations is utilized  whether it moves closer to its ideals of international peace and prosperity or is forced to lower its sights and retreat.Emerging from a course of introspection and reforms upon which it embarked on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary  the United Nations today seems to be experiencing a renaissance as we approach the next half-century. As long as Member States make a determined effort through the United Nations  and strive to meet such urgent global challenges as attaining peace and making progress in disarmament  sustaining prosperity  resolving environmental problems and establishing a society in which human dignity is respected  then world-wide trust in the United Nations and expectations concerning its future role can only increase.The United Nations has a major role to play and we  its Member States  have grave responsibilities to fulfil in ensuring the international community's stability and prosperity in the 1990s. Ever since becoming a Member  Japan has attached great importance to the United Nations. Its trust in the Organization is unwavering  and its expectations of the role it has to play remain undiminished. As a responsible member of the global community and as a staunch supporter of the international order  Japan is determined to do its utmost within the United Nations to create a world of peace and prosperity and an international community that is more just and more responsive to human needs."
"77",3690,"KEN",44,1989,"ï»¿My President  Mr. Daniel Arap has directed me to convey to you  Mr. President  his best wishes for a successful forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I should also like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this body. Africa is proud to see one of her illustrious sons occupy this lofty chair. You can  Sir  count on my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of your duties in directing the affairs of the Assembly.I should also like to convey to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Foreign Minister of Argentina  my delegation's sincere appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he presided over and guided the affairs of this Organization during its forty-third session. The international political scene continues to undergo encouraging and positive developments in the search for solutions to regional and global problems. The past few years have witnessed previously inconceivable progress in long-standing disputes and conflicts and much of this progress has been the result of a renewed optimism and faith in the relevance and role of the United Nations. This Organization  whose fundamental principle is the maintenance of international peace and security  has consistently striven to demonstrate the superiority of negotiations and mediation over confrontation in the conduct of international relations. The increasing success in global acceptance of this process is in no small measure due to the effective and outstanding leadership of the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  and I express my delegation's sincere appreciation of his untiring efforts in promoting the objectives of the United Nations.The important contributions this Organization made towards resolving regional conflicts in 1988 have been further expanded in 1989 to include the independence process for Namibia. Similarly  there are encouraging signs that the United Nations will be required to play a pivotal role in the resolution of the Kampuchean problem and the crises in Central America. Those heavy responsibilities cannot be effectively carried out without the full support of all members of the international community. Kenya wishes to put on record its total support for all United Nations efforts aimed at securing international peace. We urge all Members of this body to extend similar support and to work towards a better world in which human suffering can be alleviated and wanton waste of resources avoided.Kenya fully supports and highly commends the Secretary-General and his staff for their exemplary work in the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1 .8) on Namibia  but we are gravely concerned at South Africa's continuedrefusal to abide by the spirit and letter of that resolution. The presence of the brutal counter-insurgency Koevoet forces  in Namibia was maintained long past the deadline for their disbarment  and the laws and proclamations relating to the electoral process and the Constituent Assembly were drafted in terms that were incompressible even to the educated elite. The laws as drafted then were to facilitate the continued rule of Namibia by South Africa. The racist regime in South Africa  to use the words of President Bush  ""failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart"". (A/44/PV. 4  p. 52) We hope that the amended laws to be published soon will make possible free and fair elections in November. Thus Kenya urgently calls on the international community to put pressure on South Africa to abide fully with resolution 435 (1978) in order to avoid a situation where the elections lead to more chaos and suffering rather than the peace we so dearly desire.With regard to the situation in South Africa itself  we are hopeful that the change in leadership will not be merely a change in persons. We in Kenya expect the new leadership to take truly positive and progressive steps towards a humane society in which all peoples  regardless of race  can live in harmony. However  until that time  we remain gravely concerned that  despite repeated calls for change  the racist Pretoria regime has continued to enforce its abhorrent system of apartheid and has continued to deny its black majority population its inalienable right to self-determination. We demand the immediate release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners  the lifting of the State of Emergency  an end to the brutalisation of the black population  including innocent children  the engaging of the press and the unbanning of the African National Congress of South Africa  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and other political organizations. We remain convinced that  unless immediate and effective pressure is applied on Pretoria  peaceful change will not be possible.We are equally convinced that the only means at the disposal of the international community to effect positive change is through the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist regime  in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. As President Bush told us on Monday here in this Assembly  ""freedom  once set in motion  takes on a momentum of its own""; ""we must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings""; ""Make no mistake  nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march."" (A/44/PV. 4)The odious policies of apartheid are the main source of conflict in the southern Africa region. That poses a serious threat to both regional and international peace and security. Pretoria's persistent acts of aggression and destabilization against front-line and other neighbouring States continue to wreak havoc on their economies while the influx of refugees escaping Pretoria's brutality further strain limited resources available for social development. Kenya urges the international community to provide financial and material assistance to front-line and other neighbouring States in order to assist them in reducing their economic dependence on South Africa  thereby lessening the impact of Pretoria's destabilization.Encouraging developments in some spheres of international relations only serve to underscore the need to do wore in areas where little or no progress has been made. Kenya remains deeply concerned that no positive developments have been recorded regarding the Palestinian question. The world has witnessed a rapid deterioration in the overall condition of the Palestinian people. We are convinced that no just and lasting peace can be achieved in the Middle East until the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are recognized  including their right to self-determination and to a State of their own  as already proclaimed. We commend their leaders for the positive steps they have taken towards a resolution of the Palestinian question.We continue to be distressed at the dangerous escalation of violence in Lebanon  and we urgently call for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanese territory and for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire as advanced recently by the Arab League. We support all efforts of the Arab League to resolve this tragic crisis and call on the entire international community to fully respect Lebanon's territorial integrity and its right to exercise its sovereignty within its internationally recognized boundaries.Kenya welcomes the positive developments that have been made in the search for a solution to the Kampuchean problem. We welcome Viet Nam's decision to withdraw its troops from Kampuchea by the end of this month  and fully support all efforts undertaken by the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to arrive at a just and lasting solution to the problem. Similarly  we are heartened by the continued search for a solution to the Cyprus question and also by the regional initiatives undertaken by the Presidents of Central America to achieve a peaceful climate in that sub region.In the Korean peninsula  we support the admission of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations. We are also encouraged by the renewal of the dialogue and contacts between the two Koreas  with a view to achieving the peaceful reunification of their two countries for the mutual benefit of all Korean people. We wish them the best of luck in working out the modalities for attaining this cherished goal. The Korean problem will be solved only by the Korean people themselves.In Afghanistan  we note with satisfaction the successful implementation of the Geneva Accords. It is now incumbent upon the Afghan people  however  to settle their internal problems without interference or pressure from any quarter so that peace and tranquillity can return to that country  which has suffered for so long.In all these aspects  Kenya firmly remains unswerving in its commitment to the right of all peoples to determine their own future  free of outside interference or pressure.It is Kenya's belief that disarmament is a moral imperative of the international community  if the basic objective of maintaining international peace and security is to be achieved. The continued accumulation of sophisticated and lethal nuclear and conventional weapons continues to threaten the survival of mankind. But we remain hopeful that the improved relations and intensified bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers as highlighted here by President Bush on Monday will have a positive impact on the global disarmament efforts and lead to the easing of tension in the world as a whole.As we approach the end of the decade of the 1980s  the world economy continues to cause concern. According to the 1989 World Economic Survey  global economic output grew by the high rate of 4.3 per cent in 1988. World trade increased by an even faster rate of 8.3 per cent  exceeding the rates achieved in the 1970s. But virtually all the benefits of the expansion in world output and trade accrued and continue to accumulate in favour of the industrialized countries. The expectation that the benefits of growth in the world economic output would trickle down and spread to more developing countries has not been realized. Under current trends  prospects for the future point to a deterioration of the situation. What we need is an environment of improved international economic co-operation based on the reality of the growing interdependence among national economies. We believe that this session presents many opportunities for finding ways and means of managing such interdependence. Developing countries must play a more meaningful and beneficial part in the world economic activity and decision-making. The benefit of global growth and expansion must be enjoyed by all the nations of the world.As the Economic Survey rightly puts it:""In a global view  it is an anomaly that the richest country in the world is absorbing a large part of the savings of other countries instead of attributing to the flow of capital to the rest of the world."" It is our hope that during this session we shall make progress in building the basis for the redirection of capital investment flows towards developing countries in the years ahead.The debt problem which emerged in almost all developing countries in the early 1980s has now proliferated and become a persistent crisis  halting growth  disrupting social order and increasing the threat to political stability in many developing countries. In spite of endless and strenuous adjustment efforts and debt rescheduling  the prevailing international financial and monetary system has made it virtually impossible for the affected developing countries to cope with the burden. Such decisions as those of the Toronto summit have made little or no impact and need to be strengthened.Massive net financial resource transfer from the capital-importing developing countries to developed countries has deteriorated  increasing to more than $32 billion in 1988 as compared to a previous annual range of from $20 billion to $25 billion. This has added to the burden of building the needed basic infrastructure set-up  particularly in Africa  to increase the productivity of their economies  including the capabilities for dealing with the harsh external environmental shocks. It is our hope that efforts to deal with these negative transfers will be strengthened.The problems of debt and net transfer of resources from developing countries to developed countries are tightly linked to the problem facing developing countries in the field of international trade. The most viable and effective strategy to debt solution and revitalizing sustainable growth in developing countries must provide for increased export earnings for developing countries as an important component. Yet the trend in the multilateral trading system is towards increased strains. The ongoing multilateral trade negotiations provide an important opportunity to reverse this trend and to strengthen the system.The initiative taken by the Group of 77 in calling for a special session of the General Assembly devoted entirely to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalization of the economies of developing countries  was indeed timely  It will provide an important opportunity for arriving at a consensus on development. Simultaneously  the elaboration and establishment of a new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade should provide measures for securing an improved international economic environment to support the efforts of developing countries.Africa has faced the most prolonged and serious economic crisis in history. As the Survey clearly and correctly points out:""Africa's economies remain highly vulnerable to circumstances that are largely beyond their control"". (World Economic Survey 1989  E/I989/45  p. 29) The external constraints on Africa's recovery have become more binding. Africa's external debt rose from $220.1 billion in 1987 to $210 billion in 1988. The scheduled debt ratio now amounts to about 40 per cent of export earnings. Overall commodity prices fell by nearly 13 per cent in 1988 while import prices continued to rise. Today Africa is a net exporter of financial resources while new loans are out of reach and tied to rigorous adjustment policy requirements. African economies are dominated by primary goods-producing sectors and characterized by small manufacturing sectors that are overly dependent on imported raw materials and intermediate goods  producing almost entirely for domestic use. Africa's debt-service obligations and stagnant export earnings restrict the imports that are necessary for the revival of investment and the utilization of existing agricultural and manufacturing capabilities. Urgent action is therefore required regarding the Secretary-General's suggestion in his report to this session on the work of the Organization that it is necessary to review the decisions of the Toronto summit aimed at alleviating the debt burden of low-income countries  especially African countries  where the results have so far been disappointing.Finally  my delegation would like to add its concern to that already expressed by other delegations concerning the degradation of our environment. Thepreservation and the protection of the sanctity of the environment should be the primary responsibility of all nations - big or small  developed or developing. North or South. We in Kenya have the singular honour of hosting the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Our own President  His Excellency Mr. Daniel arap Moi  has taken a decisive lead in preserving our common heritage  the wildlife  and protecting the environment. As he pointed out in his address to the opening session of the recent UNEP Governing Council:""... environmental problems are human in origin and global in nature; their solution would therefore require both human intervention and global action and co-operation"".The Committee for Development Planning has noted that environmental damage in affluent societies is a consequence of excessive development and unrestrained demands for even larger goods and services resulting in huge quantities of waste. On the other hand  in the developing countries the most fundamental environmental problems are a consequence of poverty with the ever-increasing struggle for food and energy resulting in the accelerated destruction of forests  the degradation of the soil and the depletion of water resources. Issues of economic development cannot therefore be separated from environmental issues. At our recent meeting in Caracas we  the Group of 77  devoted a lot of time to discussions on the contributions developing countries can make in global co-operation on the environment and development. These contributions  which among other things include the reaffirmation of our commitment to the strengthening of international co-operation for the protection of the environment  demonstrate the importance developing countries have attached to this issue. Kenya has taken significant steps to protect its arable land from soil erosion  by reforestation  reclaiming marginal land through the use of severely constrained financial resources and raising public awareness of the dangers involved  and mobilizing people through the spirit of self-help. We have also done our best to protect our regional marine environment. As the Secretary-General emphasized in his opening statement at the last session of the Economic and Social Council  while the challenges facing us are the responsibility of. all countries it is evident that the industrialized countries have the most to contribute not only in mitigating the damage which they are causing to the global environment but also in assisting developing countries. The deliberations during this session on a conference on environment and development present the industrialized countries with great and timely opportunities to demonstrate the political will that is so vital in laying the basis for a successful conference. It is our hope that such a conference will set in motion the desired momentum towards genuine international co-operation on the environment and sustainable development. When that conference comes let us make it an opportunity to assess what we shall have done between now and then to protect our environment rather than an assembly to lament our failure to protect our planet."
"78",3761,"KHM",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me  Sir  to take this welcome opportunity to convey to you our warmest congratulations on your accession to the presidency of the General Assembly and my sincere wishes for the complete success of your noble task.Today I have the signal honour of reading out the following message addressed to the Assembly  at its forty-fourth session  by His Royal Highness Samdech Norodom Sihanouk  leader of the Cambodian National Resistance and President of Democratic Kampuchea:""Mr. President  It is a great honour and privilege for me to address you and your august Assembly in my capacity as leader of the Cambodian National Resistance against the Vietnamese colonialist occupation and as President of Democratic Kampuchea. Allow me  first of all  to say how gratified and honoured I am to extend to you  on behalf of Democratic Kampuchea and its people  which have always maintained cordial and fraternal relations with Nigeria and its people  our profound satisfaction and most heartfelt congratulations on your brilliant election by acclamation to the lofty responsibilities of the current session of the General Assembly. This is a well-deserved tribute by our world Organization to a distinguished son of both Nigeria and Africa  as evidenced by your tireless activities against apartheid  your high human qualities  diplomatic experience and great wisdom. ""I should also like to pay a heartfelt tribute to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  for his great competence and wisdom  which made it possible for him to conduct the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly so successfully.""Last but not least  I express again - with pleasure  as always - to our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  our deep esteem and our warmest congratulations on his patient and tireless efforts  as well as on his praiseworthy initiatives aimed at upholding  in the search for solutions to complex international problems  the vigour of the principles of the United Nations Charter  in particular its objectives of universal peace  security and prosperity based on human dignity and social and economic justice. His wisdom  clear-sightedness and competence do honour to the hopes mankind has placed in the United Nations because they have restored its authority in playing its irreplaceable role of maintaining international peace and security. Never have the prestige and efficiency of the United Nations been so great and multilateralism scored such a success.""This year the problem of Cambodia has frequently been in the spotlight of the international political scene. This reflects the growing concern of the international community to see a rapid resolution of the problem  as in the case of some other regional problems. The countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have  within the framework of the Jakarta Informal Meetings  pursued their tireless  noble efforts in that direction. I have pursued my personal efforts as well  going so far as to do violence to my dignity and self-respect by meeting the head of the illegal regime installed in Phnom Penh by Vietnamese forces  with the aim of exploring all possibilities  small though they may be  for restoring to my homeland and people  peace  national independence and freedom in territorial integrity. Quite recently  from 30 July to 30 August last  Prance was kind enough to organize an international conference on Cambodia in Paris aimed at reaching a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the so-called problem of Kampuchea. To all the ASEAN countries and their Heads of State  to France and to President Francois Mitterrand  who have done so much and continue to exert such noble efforts in contributing to the rescue of Cambodia and its people  the Cambodian National Resistance  the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and I personally pay a resounding and respectful tribute and extend our deepest gratitude.""Alas  all these noble and tireless efforts have so far failed to bring about a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the so-called problem of Kampuchea.""I have put forward a five-point peace plan for a comprehensive and equitable solution of the problem - which is  let me recall  a problem between Viet Nam  the aggressor  and Cambodia  the victim. In this plan I have proposed  among other things  the two following elements:""First  the total and definitive withdrawal of all categories of Vietnamese forces and all Vietnamese settlers from Cambodia  under the effective control of a United Nations international control mechanism and assisted by a United Nations peace-keeping force.""Secondly  a genuine national reconciliation among all Cambodians  regardless of their past or political tendencies  within the framework of the formation of a provisional quadripartite government  a quadripartite administration and a quadripartite army. This is not merely a matter of power-sharing but one of achieving a balance between all the Cambodian parties so as to ensure  after the total and genuine withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces  peace  security and stability in Cambodia  in order to enable the Cambodian people to exercise their sacred right to self-determination  through free and general elections under United Nations supervision.""We do not ask of Viet Nam anything that belongs to it. We ask Viet Nam only to give back what belongs to Cambodia and the Cambodian people  namely  our independence and territorial integrity within our legal boundaries internationally recognized up to 17 March 1970. To those people in the Vietnamese-installed puppet regime in Phnom Penh  we reach out our hand in a gesture of national reconciliation  in the higher and long-term interests of Cambodia and its people.""The Phnom Penh regime is merely the creation and creature of Viet Nam imposed by force of arms in January 1979 upon the Cambodian people. The State of Democratic Kampuchea  of which I am President  could not stand aside in favour of the illegal Phnom Penh regime  nor could it rally to this regime whose Constitution  whatever the amendments  remains unacceptable because it is illegal. Nevertheless  out of concern to reach a rapid solution and shorten the suffering of the Cambodian people  we have decided to make a very substantial concession by accepting the dismantling of the legal State of Democratic Kampuchea simultaneously with that of the illegal Phnom Penh regime.""The main objective of my proposal is not  let me repeat  a power-sharing among the four Cambodian parties. It aims at creating  after the genuine withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces  a balance between all the parties which at last reconciled within a national union government of Cambodia  will be entrusted with the task of maintaining a climate of peace  security and stability within which the Cambodian people  the sole and true master of Cambodia  will be able freely to exercise their sacred right to self-determination  choose their Loaders and the political  social and economic regime to their liking ""The generosity of my proposals is matchless in history  in particular when one is familiar with the fate that was reserved for Norway's Quisling and France's Laval and their ilk shortly after the Second World War.""Nevertheless  Viet Nam has categorically rejected all my proposals. In so doing  it has given glaring proof of a complete absence of political will  sincerity and good faith in the search for a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to the so-called problem of Kampuchea. In response to the appeal made by Mr. Roland Dumas  Minister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs of France  and Co-President of the Conference  for flexibility on the part of all the participants  Mr. Nguyen Co Thach  Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs  replied that 'Viet Nam shall be as flexible as steel'.""By refusing to place the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia under the effective control of the United Nations  and by opposing the formation of a provisional quadripartite government of Cambodia  which might enable the Cambodian people freely and democratically to choose their leaders  Viet Nam has simply shown that it does not have the slightest intention of putting an end to its colonialist occupation of Cambodia and its policy of annexation of Cambodia into the 'Indo-China Federation' under Hanoi's domination. Indeed  United Nations control and the provisional quadripartite government of Cambodia would give evidence to the whole world of the existence in Cambodia of at least 30 000 Vietnamese soldiers disguised as Khmer solders of the Phnom Penh puppet regime  of at least 100 000 armed Vietnamese concealed among the more than one million Vietnamese settlers  of several tens of thousands of so-called Vietnamese advisors  disguised as 'Cambodians' in the puppet administrative apparatus  from the top down to the village levels. For Viet Nam to accept United Nations control is to accept putting an end to Vietnamese colonialism in Cambodia and giving up its 'Indo-China Federation'.""Viet Nam refuses any effective United Nations role in Cambodia under the pretext that our world Organization is 'biased' because it continues to recognize among its Members Democratic Kampuchea  the victim of Vietnamese aggression  and that the General Assembly continues yearly to adopt a resolution condemning this aggression and calling for the total and unconditional withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces of aggression. From the dock  Viet Nam wants to pose as a judge  to call into question the 122 States members of the United Nations that voted last year for the resolution of the situation in Kampuchea and to compel them to violate  like Viet Nam  the United Nations Charter.""Viet Nam rejects the formation of a provisional quadripartite government of Cambodia  an organ of genuine Cambodian national reconciliation  because this government would necessarily comprise the Democratic Kampuchea party  'the Khmer Rouge*. In order to justify its crimes against Cambodia and the Cambodian people  Viet Nam continues to brandish the 'Pol Pet-Khmer Rouge danger"" and the 'prevention of their return to power' as being one of the fundamental aspects of the so-called problem of Kampuchea.""I do not have the slightest intention of defending the cause of the Khmer Rouge  nor do I have any reason to do so. But objectivity prompts me to say that if one should judge and condemn the Khmer Rouge for violation of human rights  one should also be fair enough to judge and condemn the Hanoi leaders and their Phnom Fenh puppets for their crimes against humanity committed in Cambodia  as evidenced by Amnesty International in its annual reports  backed by many details  photographs  sketches and drawings.""I agree that the problem of strict respect for human rights in Cambodia is extremely important and that it is essential that effective and realistic measures be taken to ensure such respect. But the most urgent measure is the definitive and genuine withdrawal of Vietnamese colonialism in all its forms from Cambodia.""As for the Khmer Rouge  they have provided formal written guarantees of their non-return to exclusive power after the total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia. They have formally requested the sending to Cambodia of a United Nations control mechanism and a substantial United Nations peace-keeping force. They have proposed the total disarming of their armed forces  together with that of the armed forces of the other Cambodian parties  or at least the reduction in strength of each of the Cambodian armed forces to10 000 men  and the restriction of those forces in barracks under the supervision of a United Nations control mechanism. They have solemnly renounced communism and accepted for Cambodia a liberal democratic regime and political pluralism similar to that of the Fifth French Republic. They also pledge fully and always to respect the return of free and general elections supervised by the United Nations. Finally  their leaders  such as Pol Pot  Nuon Chea  Ta Mok  and others  have solemnly declared that they shall give up any political  government  administrative or military activities in the new Cambodia resulting from a comprehensive settlement of the so-called problem of Kampuchea.""For national reconciliation to be genuine  it cannot be exclusive. If one of the Cambodian parties were to be excluded  it would be vain to attempt to ensure this peace  security and stability so essential to the self-determination of the Cambodian people.""The Cambodian National Resistance and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea have made the maximum concessions possible to Viet Nam  save that of handing Cambodia over to Viet Nam on a silver platter  which is what Viet Nam is seeking.""The so-called total and unilateral withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia  proclaimed for and allegedly completed on 26 September last  aims actually at  first  having the world community rubber-stamp the so-called cessation of Viet Nam's occupation of Cambodia* secondly  having foreign military aid to the forces of the Cambodian National Resistance curtailed; thirdly  obtaining the de facto maintenance of the Phnom Penh puppet regime under the cover of which Viet Nam will continue to occupy Cambodia with several tens of thousands of Vietnamese troops disguised as puppet soldiers  with more than a hundred thousand militiamen concealed among the more than 1 million Vietnamese settlers and several tens of thousands of Vietnamese 'advisers' at all levels of the puppet administration.""In order to ease the ever greater and more resolute pressures exerted each year by the overwhelming majority of United Nations Menfoer States  the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam is driven to resort to the subterfuge of unilateral withdrawal of some of its troops in uniform without any effective control by the United Nations  while other disguised troops continue to come into Cambodia without the knowledge of the world community  with the obviousobjective of trying to turn its aggression and occupation into a so-called civil war  backed by a major Vietnamese 'fifth column' disguised within the puppet army  and concealed among the Vietnamese settlers.""Without an international control and supervision mechanism of the United Nations  the so-called total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia is merely a fraud and a manoeuvre intended to lull world public opinion and to obtain Western aid  which Viet Nam has been denied because of its occupation of Cambodia.""If our Assembly were to allow itself to be persuaded by this deceitful Vietnamese propaganda  the United Nations Charter would be trampled underfoot  and the fate of small countries such as Cambodia  which is based on the defence of their own rights  could no longer be defended. Faith in the United Nations would be shaken if one of its Members were to be allowed to continue  as for almost 11 years now  to trample underfoot with impunity the principles of the Charter  and shamelessly mock the international will of the United Nations to fulfil its role of maintaining international peace and security.""The sole objective of the Cambodian National Resistance and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea is to fulfil the deep and legitimate aspirations of the entire Cambodian people  that is  the restoration of peace in Cambodia  in independence and freedom. In the face of the arrogant obstinacy of Viet Nam  which wants to pursue at all costs its colonialist occupation of Cambodia  the Cambodian National Resistance and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea have no other choice but to carry on their struggle for the realization of these aspirations  so long as Viet Nam does not agree to withdraw genuinely  under the control of the United Nations mechanism  assisted by a United Nations peace-keeping force  all categories of its forces from Cambodia so long as it refuses to restore to Cambodia its full and complete independence as well as its territorial integrity  and to the Cambodian people their sacred and inalienable right to self-determination. The Phnom Penh regime is unacceptable. Whatever Viet Nam may do  that regime is illegal  because it is a mere creation  a pure creature of Viet Nam  and it only serves Viet Nam's ideological  strategic  economic and expansionist interests. We are confident that  being aware of Viet Nam's machiavellian subterfuge  all peace- and justice-loving countries whose representatives are present here in this Assembly  will not fail to continue to grant their noble and steadfast support to our just cause: the survival of the Cambodian nation and its national identity. To all of them  I should like  on behalf of the Cambodian National Resistance  the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and on my own behalf  to express once again our most profound  sincere and infinite gratitude.""Since the last session of the General Assembly  the world political situation has been marked by some encouraging developments which have fortunately resulted in a progressive redaction of international tension.""The year 1989 is undeniably an auspicious year for Africa  thanks to a favourable development in the search for solutions to regional and local conflicts. The 22 December 1988 agreements have at last paved the way for the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  embodied in Security Council resolution 435 (1978).""In a month's time  the Namibian people will at last  after more than a century of illegal foreign colonization and occupation  be able to exercisetheir right to self-determination and independence together with territorial integrity. Nothing now should prevent them from fully enjoying this right. This is the triumph of their long heroic combat waged under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization  of the firm and manifold support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of all African countries and peoples  of the dedicated efforts of the United Nations and its Council for Namibia  and of the prodigious mobilization of the entire international community in their favour. Together with all the other Member States of the United Nations  we impatiently look forward to sincerely welcoming a new nation  Namibia  into our world Organization.""in Western Sahara  the efforts of our Secretary-General and the current President of the OAU have made it possible to establish a technical commission to facilitate and speed up the process of implementation of the peace plan accepted by all the concerned parties on 30 August 1988 in Geneva.""In Chad  the framework agreement signed by the Chadian and Libyan Governments offers a legal basis and a mechanism for the settlement of their territorial dispute. That agreement testifies to the will of Chad to establish peaceful relations with all its neighbours in a spirit of respect for its sovereignty  territorial integrity and fundamental rights  in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and the resolutions of the OAU. We wish new successes to the brotherly Chadian Government and people in their steadfast efforts to defend peace and independence  and in the development of their homeland.""However  the tree should not hide the forest. Indeed  those encouraging developments do contribute to the improvement of the world political climate but they remain limited. They should not make us forget that the world political situation remains a matter of concern.""In southern Africa  the situation remains tense because the policy of apartheid of the racist minority regime of Pretoria constitutes a permanent source of threat to peace and stability in the African subcontinent. Together with all peace-  justice- and freedom-loving peoples and countries  we strongly condemn the criminal repression of the black majority population in South Africa by the apartheid regime of Pretoria  and the policy of bantustanization. We demand the immediate lifting of the state of emergency and the release of Mr. Nelson Mandela and all political prisoners. We here renew our full support for the just and legitimate struggle of the valiant South African people and their leaders  the African National Congress of South Africa and Pan Africanist Congress of Azania.""We reiterate our firm solidarity and our steadfast support for all of the frontline States in their struggle against Pretoria's policy of aggression and destabilization. We reaffirm our conviction that peace and stability will o>me to southern Africa only with the eradication of apartheid and the formation of a non-racist and democratic government in South Africa. The holding next December of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the question of apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa  will surely bring about additional aid and support with a view to attaining that noble objective for which the South African people and the entire international community are mobilized.""In the Middle East  the situation continues to worsen. The heroic resistance of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories testifies to the fact that acquisition of the territory of others by force is inadmissible  and that the question of Palestine lies at the very root of the Israeli-Arab conflict. The declaration of the independent State of Palestine  the support of the Casablanca Extraordinary Summit of the Arab League for the decisions of the Palestine National Council in Algiers  and the dialogue between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization are all elements conducive to the convening of an International Peace Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all parties to the conflict  in particular the Palestine Liberation Organization. Peace will be restored in the Middle East only with the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people  including their rights to create an independent State of Palestine  and the right of all States in the region to live in security within recognized boundaries guaranteed on the basis of peaceful coexistence.""In Lebanon  the fire of discord and disintegration is being stirred up by the intervention of foreign armed forces. It is essential that the relevant resolutions of the Security Council be implemented  and that all foreign troops withdraw so as to enable the Lebanese people to regain peace and national unity  and the Lebanese State to recover its territorial integrity and full sovereignty by deploying its legitimate forces throughout the country.""More than a year after the cessation of hostilities  the conflict between Iran and Iraq is not yet resolved. It is our earnest hope that the efforts of the two parties to pursue direct negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General  in the framework of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  will result rapidly in a comprehensive  just and durable solution to the conflict. That would bring about a major contribution to the extinction of a hotbed of tension in the Middle East.""In Central America  a just and lasting peace has so far failed to be restored. Nevertheless  there is no other way to achieve this goal than the measures taken by the Contadora Group  the Support Group  and the Esquipulas II Agreements. It is in this spirit that we reiterate our support for the diplomatic efforts and regional negotiations conducted on the basis of the principles that have inspired these measures and agreements  in particular the Tela Declaration of the five Central American States on 7 August 1988.""In Asia  our continent  efforts to reunify Korea have not yet yielded much progress despite the sacred and unanimous wish of the entire Korean people. It is important that the meetings and talks at all levels  in all fields between the two Korean parties  be expanded in conformity with the wise  realistic and patriotic proposals of President Kim 111 Sung. It is undeniable that steadfast efforts are necessary for building up and developing reciprocal confidence and understanding that are indispensable to a sustained process towards a peaceful and independent reunification of the Korean fatherland.""In Afghanistan  because the withdrawal of Soviet troops has not put an end to the war  the Afghan people continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination. In order to restore peace to this country  one should not forget that war was triggered by the Soviet invasion and that the Kabul regime has lost all legitimacy because it opened up the country to that invasion  and that its present leaders have been installed by the invaders. The arguments according to which Pakistan is ostensibly responsible for the pursuit of the war can mislead no one because one hardly perceives what pleasure Pakistan could take in prolonging the burden of more than 3 million Afghan refugees to whom it has to give shelter on its territory for nearly 10 years now. Pakistan and its people should be congratulated and admired for their tireless humanitarian action in favour of these Afghan refugees. The settlement of the problem of Afghanistan lies in the steps to be taken in order to enable the Afghan people once again to become the masters of their own destiny and to choose their own leaders without any foreign intervention or pressure. The international community has the sacred right and duty to support the just and legitimate struggle of the Afghan people to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination.""The encouraging developments that we have seen in some parts of the world do lead us  indeed  to a moderate optimism  but we must also be vigilant. Indeed  during the last two years we have seen that those who are prompted by colonialist and expansionist designs have changed their tactics but not their strategy. The case of my country  Cambodia  is obvious. Viet Nam has not at all abandoned its annexationist designs. It is the struggle waged by the Cambodian National Resistance together with the entire Cambodian people  world pressure  and isolation faced in the international arena  and the catastrophic social  political and economic difficulties at home that have compelled Viet Nam to change its tactics. Viet Nam is desperately trying to achieve its expansionist goals through diplomatic manoeuvres and subterfuges as it has failed to attain them through military efforts. The Cambodian National Resistance  the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea  the Cambodian people and I myself  will in no way allow Viet Nam to realize its expansionist dream to the detriment of our beloved Motherland.""History has taught us that freedom and peace are never granted  but rather acquired through hard-fought  multiform  just and resolute struggle. Our gains obtained during these past years are the results of such a common struggle for peace  justice and freedom-loving countries and people  we are confident that our endeavours in this direction will secure other victories that will help strengthen world peace and security  which constitute the sacred goal of the United Nations Charter and the most noble task with which we all are entrusted.""May I be permitted to express my warm thanks to you and your kind attention to this message of Norodom Sihanouk."
"79",3802,"KNA",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  let me on behalf of the delegation of Saint Kitts and Nevis congratulate you on your election to office. My delegation has absolute confidence in your abilities and those of the Vice Presidents  and we pledge our full support and co-operation.I seize this opportunity to pay tribute to our distinguished Secretary-General  Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the diligence  commitment and perseverance he has displayed in working untiringly in the cause of peace. His efforts have been crowned with success. It is a success  however  which can be very fragile if it is not bolstered by the determination of the international community to support the cause of peace everywhere in the world.Mr. President  I bring you warmest greetings from the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis  the Right Honourable Dr. Kennedy Alphonse Simmonds  who had made all the arrangements to be here in this august body. You will appreciate that a tragic disaster has kept him at home. It was the seventeenth day of September  just two days before the sixth anniversary of the independence of our nation. All arrangements for the celebration were completed; many calls and expressions of congratulation were arriving from the family of nations. Suddenly we were struck by a horrendous hurricane called Hugo that left a path of death  destruction  tragedy and homelessness in the eastern Caribbean.We in Saint Kitts and Nevis had proudly enjoyed a 5.8 per cent annual rate of growth in our economy over the past five years. We had developed our infrastructure to ensure a better way of life for every man  woman and child in our country  while adhering to the tenets of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Suddenly we found ourselves faced with the stark reality that the hands of the clock had been turned back and that it would be a number of years before we could repair the damage done by Hugo. A statement on hurricane Hugo has already been made to the General Committee by the representative of Antigua and Barbuda on behalf of his Government and those of Dominica and Saint Kitts and Nevis  and I do not wish to burden this Assembly with our tale of woe. Suffice it to say that one cannot describe the tragedy that resulted after being buffeted continuously for over 10 hours by winds of some 140 miles per hour accompanied by some 10 inches of rainfall. Hundreds of persons are homeless and living in emergency shelters. Hospitals have been extensively damaged. Schools  churches  colleges  factories  police stations and ports have been destroyed. Electricity poles and wires were blown down  the water system damaged. Huge trees were uprooted and crops destroyed.On behalf of the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis  I must thank the various countries and agencies of the United Nations for the speedy assistance rendered. However  I wish to emphasize that to deal with the situation in the short term is not enough  and I call upon all members to help in the long-term rehabilitation of our infrastructure.We have been fortunate in restoring the infrastructure for the tourism sector  so we can attempt to balance the loss in agriculture and light industry.I turn now to the international scene  which seems to have some rays of light owing  in large part  to this Organization  so ably spearheaded by the Secretary-General.In this context my delegation welcomes the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq. We commend the role of the Secretary-General and the United Nations forces stationed there for working towards maintaining the cessation of hostilities and in continuously monitoring the situation there.The task of the peace-keeping forces in that area and elsewhere is a vital but hazardous one which obviously requires extensive monetary resources for effective functioning. We call upon the economically strong end powerful States within the United Nations system to meet their obligations to the Organization -hat it may carry out its mandate for peace with greater efficiency.In Afghanistan the conflict still smoulders. I appeal for an end to civil strife in that troubled country. I reiterate the need for the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Afghanistan. There is a need for greater dialogue among the various internal factions  and for the creation of a political climate conducive to enabling Afghan refugees to return to their homeland. In the final analysis the peaceful resolution of the Afghan problem can best be achieved by the Afghan people.In many of our countries  the will of the people is the foundation on which our societies are built. The will of my people in Saint Kitts and Nevis was freely and fairly exercised  without fear  on 21 March this year. I can do no other  therefore  that to speak out in defence of the will of peoples everywhere.I wish to commend very highly the Secretary-General's initiative in relation to Western Sahara  resulting in the establishment of a technical commission to advance the peace process in that area. My delegation welcomes the convening of the July meeting in New York to investigate the possibility of accelerating end facilitating implementation of the united Nations and Organization of African unity settlement proposals  and the participation in the discussions of representatives of Morocco and the POLISARIO. I urge continued dialogue between the POLISARIO and the Kingdom of Morocco and a continued search for areas of agreement in the interest of the peace and stability of Western Sahara. There too the voice of the people should be heard. Our efforts to assist the people of Kampuchea to obtain peace and justice must continue unabated. Following the call of the General Assembly at its forty-third session for the creation of an interim administration in Cambodia  an international conference was held in Paris in July and August 1989  at which the nations of South-East Asia participated with others to develop a comprehensive peace plan to end two decades of fighting in Cambodia. We commend the Secretary-General for convening the conference. We must appeal to all parties to work within the United Nations framework to ensure that there is no return to the atrocities of the past.I also request the Secretary-General to use his good offices to initiate a full investigation of the violence and abuses of power that occurred on the mainland of China in June of this year.In the Middle East too the conflict continues unabated. There too the United Nations must seek to foster peace through dialogue. In spite of all the complexities of the conflict  one of the basic parameters for peace is that the right of the Palestinian people to a well-defined homeland mist coexist with the right of the people of Israel to live within secure borders. A first step to peace would be for all parties to adhere to the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on the issue. My delegation also supports the proposal for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East.In our region  encompassing Central America and the Caribbean  we have had both progressive and disquieting developments. In the Caribbean we have seen Governments either returned to office or changed at the will of the people in free aid fair elections. My delegation commends the Governments of Central America for the sustained and determined efforts they have made to restore peace and stability to the region. We recognize that the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS) have contributed to the improvement in the level of harmony which is becoming more evident in the region. We applaud the collective constructive role those organizations are playing in the movement towards new elections in Nicaragua in 1990.It is a source of great satisfaction to us that the Cartagena Protocol has been ratified  as it facilitates the membership in the OAS of Guyana and Belize  our partners in the Caribbean Community and Common Market  and undoubtedly has a positive impact on the encouragement of friendly relations between Belize and Guatemala. I must stress  however  that my country's support for the sovereignty of Belize remains undiminished.Among the areas of disquiet already referred to in the region is Panama. In that country the will of the people was thwarted and frustrated by the untimely intervention of the military in the election process. This has led to an instability which can ultimately affect others in the region. My delegation condemns the blatant denial of the people's rights and calls for a speedy return to democracy there.The people of Haiti too have suffered a similar fate  we call on the regime in Haiti to take all necessary steps to ensure that the people can freely elect a Government of their choice  so the Government so chosen can have a mandate and the authority to address the serious economic aid social ills of that country through its own efforts and also by the mobilization of international assistance. We cannot speak out in defence of the freedom and the human rights of people everywhere  then remain silent when people's rights are trampled and their freedom denied in South Africa. What is being called progress is nothing but a smoke-screen  a thin veneer which can be wiped away to reveal apartheid  still present in all its ugliness and inhumanity. There can be no moderate apartheid  no acceptable apartheid. We must not let our guard down; we must not be lulled into a false sense of complacency while the black majority are denied the right to vote  and denied the free exercise of a status equal to that of the white minority. No  the only solution is an end to apartheid and an acceptance that all men are created equal and that all are entitled to breathe the fresh air of freedom. Until that time we must be resolute in the application of sanctions against South Africa. That regime must never be in doubt about the intensity of our abhorrence of the evil system of apartheid.In that context  I must warn that  according to our information  in spite of resolutions adopted at the forty-third session of the General Assembly  major obstacles to free and fair elections in Namibia still persist. There is still an atmosphere of fear and intimidation created by members of the South African Koevoet. There is still fear that secrecy will not be assured  and that some South African officials will be able to manipulate the elections. My delegation strongly supports Security Council resolution 640 (1989)  adopted unanimously on Tuesday  29 August 1989  calling for all parties  especially South Africa  to comply strictly with resolution 435 (1978)  which details election procedures and provides for the disbanding of all paramilitary and ethnic forces and commando units. I call for an end to South African subversion of the Namibian independence process  and I must emphasize that it is the collective responsibility of the Governments members of the United Nations jointly to facilitate the establishment in Namibia of a stable government and economy. Sometimes our progress to Utopia appears slow  but we must not become weary. It is clear that  in spite of a multiplicity of problems  this Organization  the United Nations  has contributed and continues to contribute to the resolution of conflicts and the ushering in of conciliation and peace throughout the world. In recognition of this  I call for continuation of dialogue between South Korea and North Korea to achieve their mutual objectives. At the same time  I believe it would be timely and advantageous to welcome both of those countries which occupy the Korean peninsula into membership of the United Nations.I shall now turn my attention to the issue of drug abuse. This is one of the most devastating threats facing the world today  a growing menace that transcends frontiers and cuts across political  economic and social boundaries  that cannot be controlled by any one country single-handedly.At the recent meeting of the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community  agreement was reached as to the need for the creation of appropriate international mechanisms to assist in combating drug trafficking - namely  the Jamaican proposal for a multilateral force established under the United Nations to provide assistance in intelligence and interdiction; and the Trinidad and Tobago proposal for the establishment of commissions of inquiry and an international criminal court to investigate and adjudicate on the criminal responsibility of persons engaged in offences such as drug trafficking. We must continue to bear in mind  however  that  while recognizing the international implications of anti-drug operations  we must steadfastly respect the sovereignty of all States.There are countries to which the issue of disarmament is more immediately relevant. I wish to emphasize  however  that progress in the area of disarmament creates the opportunity for substantial resources to be diverted to more humanitarian pursuits  including the protection of the environment. Whereas the protection and preservation of a healthy environment is important to all countries  it is crucial to the economic growth of developing island countries. We must depend upon the sea around us to provide abundant marine life to sustain us and our beaches and pure air to attract visitors from the crowded metropolis. The protection of the environment is the protection of life itself.I come from a beautiful  peaceful country with no enemies  but subject to the vagaries of nature which can  in the twinkling of an eye  destroy our entire infrastructure and set us back decades. I am sure that I speak for all the people of my country  St. Kitts and Nevis  when I say that it is good to be a Member of this world body  which will listen to the voices of all its members  which will help in times of need  and which will continue to be the guiding light in times of tragedy  whether created by man or by a greater force."
"80",3874,"KWT",44,1989,"ï»¿I have the honour to congratulate Mr. Garba  on behalf of Kuwait  upon his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General A3seitbly. We are pleased that he comes from Nigeria  a friendly African country with which we maintain good relations and share common interests. We are confident that his experience and competence will be of great help to us in ensuring the success of the work of this session.I am also pleased to commend his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  the former foreign Minister of Argentina  for his success in conducting the work of the last session.I am making this statement ""after having listened and followed for the past three weeks  the speeches of many Heads of State and delegations representing the entire world community  with all its different policies and orientations. The common denominator and consensus among all those valuable contributions made by those who have spoken before me was that  on the threshold of the 1990s and drawing near to the advent of the twenty-first century  the world is encountering unprecedented opportunities for peace and development  as well as new challenges that have arisen from the nature of the political  economic and social evolution ofthe world. We must face these opportunities and challenges with new thinking and advanced methods of action that take into consideration the international variables we are now experiencing and witnessing. It is our destiny and responsibility at this juncture to seize opportunities that have the potential to create the appropriate atmosphere for a new dawn in international relations  a dawn that derives its light from the triumph of reason and diplomacy over bigotry and force. It is also our destiny and responsibility to stand up to the new challenges that will put our will to the test  in particular the challenges resulting from the international economic situation  of which indebtedness is one of the most significant components. There are also the challenges of the social situation  in which the questions of environment and drugs are salient features as well as the challenge of international terrorism  which threatens the very core of our values  traditions and norms.*The role and importance of the United Nations increase in such conditions and thus the organization requires continuous support. Kuwait wishes to express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  its deep appreciation of his efforts and dedication in utilizing the positive aspects emerging in the international arena for the benefit of world peace and to consolidate its foundations  and to reaffirm its support for him and his endeavours.There is no doubt that the international political atmosphere is improving and that there is detente in international relations. There is the danger  however  that this improvement will not continue while the world economic situation continues to deteriorate and seems even to become more complicated  since the gap between the developed and the developing countries remains wide and is increasing. Meanwhile  the world debt is growing  the prices of raw materials are falling. tariff and trade barriers are increasing  the balance of payments is in a state of disequilibrium  and technical know-how and technological advancement remain the exclusive monopoly of a handful of nations which refuse to share them with others. Kuwait feels that the debt problem poses the most intractable and significant obstacle to development. It requires urgent  comprehensive solutions that take into consideration the human suffering that afflicts the peoples of the debtor countries. The debt problem has become a source of despair and frustration to them.It was against this backdrop that the historic initiative by His highness the Emir of the State of Kuwait  Sheikh Jaber A1 Ahmad A1 Jaber A1 Sabah  was announced from this rostrum last year. Its aim was the alleviation of the debt burden and the distressed economies of the developing countries  thus extricating those countries from the cycle of crises in which they have been rotating and launching a new phase of more equitable and just international economic relations.In line with his commitment to this benevolent approach. His highness the Emir proposed before the ninth summit Conference of non-aligned States  held in Belgrade last September  an appropriate mechanism to set in motion the implementation of his proposal concerning the debt problem.The Emir of Kuwait did not confine his effort to sounding the alarm about the debt problem  but embarked boldly upon tackling the issue  with toe appropriate prescription for its cure  in which he pursues justice and highlights altruism. The world community should therefore study this proposal  toe text of which was submitted to the Secretary-General  by virtue of his responsibilities  so that it might be considered in a spirit of co-operation and faith in our common human destiny.Together  we are proceeding towards the 1990s benefiting from the positive developments in most centres of international disputes  developments which have been inspired by the new spirit whose warmth has begun to thaw the frost around those disputes. An earnest and impartial attitude is necessary on all sides  together with a rearrangement of our priorities  to exploit this new spirit.The withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and Cambodia  the implementation of the plans aimed at settling the situation in Central America and the continuance of dialogue in Cyprus are all examples of the new responsibilities of the people in those countries in the realization of national harmony and unity  the consolidation of stability and security  and the preparation and implementation of the economic development plans which the peoples of those regions need.However  neither global peace and security  nor economic development and world prosperity can last or be ensured as long as the Palestinian question remains without a ""just solution. The Middle East region has for four decades been living with a conflict which has always been and still is a threat to world peace  security and stability. At the root of that conflict is the cause of the Palestinian people  a people that Israel has been attempting by the most inhumane means of all kinds to uproot aid expel from its land  while obliterating its national identity.Nevertheless  Israel daily awakens to the fact that brute force  however tyrannical  cannot extinguish the torch of the political struggle being waged by the Palestinian people. On the contrary  it only fans the flames  and consequently brings nearer the attainment of that people's legitimate objectives. There have been two developments of considerable significance in the Palestinian struggle: first  the outbreak of the intifadah  which is nearing the end of its second year  and  secondly  the positive and brave position adapted by the Palestinian leadership since the meeting of the Palestine National Council in November 1988. At that meeting  the Palestinian leadership declared its readiness to assume full responsibility for the establishment of a comprehensive peace based on the principles set forth in the Proclamation of the independent Palestinian State  with Holy Jerusalem as its capital  and with ail the international rights and obligations that such readiness implies.At the recent summit conference at Casablanca all the Arab countries endorsed and supported the resolutions of the Palestine National Council and the new line adopted by the Palestinian leadership. As a result  the Palestinian position is now an Arab one. It is a position that seeks peace anew and puts forward an integrated plan based on justice  international laws and relevant United Nations resolutions.Those two developments with respect to Palestine increase the responsibility of the international community in general  and the United Nations in particular  to deter Israel from persisting in its obduracy  its rejection of every just peace initiative and its continued perpetration of crimes. Israel must be pressed to respond to international variables and to yield to the logic of right and justice. Israel cannot swim against the world tide; it certainly will not be able to resist its surging waves forever.  Comprehensive peace is a product of international will  which is unified in calling for an international peace conference with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all parties involved in the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation organization (PLO)  the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  on an equal footing. The international community believes that such a conference constitutes the legal framework within which the Palestinian issue must finally find a just and la3ting solution.The people of the sister country of Lebanon have for 14 years been suffering through a crushing tragedy that threatens their security and stability and has completely devastated and wreaked havoc on their country. The use of force and violence has intensified to the point that the country's national unity and territorial integrity are seriously jeopardized. Earnest and sincere Arab efforts have been exerted to halt the irresponsible hostilities in that Arab country and to achieve national concord based on the justice  equality and coexistence that have characterized the Lebanese people throughout history. At present the sister Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is acting as host to a meeting of members of the Lebanese Parliament to debate the document on national concord proposed by the Tripartite high Arab Committee that was authorized by the recent Arab summit conference to find an appropriate formula for national reconciliation that would definitively stop the fratricidal fighting  preserve Lebanon's national unity  territorial integrity and sovereignty over all its soil  and realize the coexistence and fraternity of all the population in one unified entity on a basis of equality and justice. The international community  which is shocked by the deteriorating situation in Lebanon  is urged to support the Tripartite high Arab Committee and to help it succeed in attaining its goals.We are  however  in duty bound to declare that the situation in Lebanon will not be settled as long as Israel continues to occupy part of its territory  to interfere in its internal affairs  and to persist in acts of aggression against Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity. The international community roust compel Israel to implement the many Security Council resolutions calling for complete unconditional withdrawal from Lebanese territory. Without such withdrawal  the cycle of violence will continue to afflict that torn country and abort every sincere effort made for its sake.Perhaps one of the most remarkable achievements of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security is Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which provided the foundation for the halting of the Iran-Iraq war. Since the endorsement of that resolution by the two parties  regional and international efforts have been focused on achieving success in the on going negotiations between the two countries under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General. However  unfortunately those negotiations have not vet led to the desired conclusion  namely consummation of a lasting peace based on good-neighbourliness  fraternity and constructive co-operation in which the countries and peoples of the region will enjoy security and stability. We are therefore obliged  by necessity and by duty  to continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at making the negotiations a success and full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).We are looking forward to the forthcoming visit of Mr. Jan Eliasson  the Secretary-General's Personal Representative  to Baghdad and Teheran  we support his benevolent efforts  and we wish him all success in his coming mission. Kuwait is grieved to see that an important humanitarian aspect of the sequels of hostilities remains unsolved. The exchange of prisoners of war has not yet been completed  nor have some of its technicalities been ironed out. We call for thecompletion of that exchange as expeditiously as possible  for we believe that that would demonstrate the goodwill and intentions of both parties with regard to the full implementation of resolution 598 (1987) so that peace  security and co-operation may prevail in that critical part of the world.The positive developments in Namibia  as reflected by the implementation of the steps set forth in Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  are gratifying to the international community. Kuwait urges support for fee United Nations efforts to implement resolution 435 (1978) fully and calls for alertness and caution vis-Ã -vis fee practices and strategies of South Africa aimed at undermining Namibia's independence plan or at turning it into independence in name only. Kuwait  which has always supported fee South West Africa People's organization (SWAPO) as fee legitimate representative of the Namibian people  is hopeful that the young State will join fee ranks of independent countries and contribute to fee security  stability and welfare of the African continent.Although fee world has managed to score some progress in fee Namibian question  the African wounds will not heal until the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa has been dismantled  until the native black majority there has fully regained its rights and until democratic majority rule has been established in feat country  thus restoring to African persons in South Africa their dignity and sovereignty over their land and returning life to normal.We look forward to a General Assembly session notable for its achievements and expressive of the positive spirit that lights the sky and serves as a beacon and inspiration for our countries and peoples. May God grant us success."
"81",3920,"LAO",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me first on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to congratulate you  Sir  most warmly on your unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. My delegation is convinced that under your skilful guidance the work of this session will be crowned with success.I should also like to take this opportunity to express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  our feelings of renewed confidence in the tireless efforts he has made to promote and strengthen peace and co-operation among nations. The general international situation has seen a certain easing of tension following the resumption of the dialogue between the two main Powers  the Soviet Union and the United States of America  which made possible the signature and entry into force of the Treaty between tine United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics can the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. With this very welcome step the world now awaits the conclusion of other agreements on disarmament  particularly one relating to the reduction by 50 per cent of strategic offensive weapons as mentioned encouragingly by the delegations of the Soviet Union and the United States in their statements last week. The deadly capacity of conventional aid chemical weapons also requires full attention from us all. There are grounds for hoping that an agreement will be concluded as soon as possible.While the general international situation has seen positive changes  nevertheless it remains complex aid full of contradictions. We still see the stockpiling and modernization of weapons  continuing nuclear tests and also research into the militarization of space. Certain Western circles do not seem to be willing to give up their ideas of aggression  interference  the use of force and confrontation  which date back to the dark years of the cold war. Thus the concept of nuclear deterrence reaffirmed by certain great Powers at a time when all our energies are being channelled into building a non-violent world free of nuclear weapons is a threat to the interests and security of all peoples and nations of the world. It should be noted  moreover  that in certain regions conflicts that have lasted for decades have not only not been resolved satisfactorily but are becoming ever more convoluted and tragic military bases are not being dismantled and continue to threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.In the Persian Gulf area  the political wisdom guiding the leaders of Iran and Iraq has enabled those two fraternal countries to conclude a cease-fire  thus putting an end to a destructive and agonizing war which tore them apart for nearly eight years. We are convinced that the various efforts being made to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  efforts broadly encouraged aid supported by the international community  are sure to achieve the hoped-for result  namely  a final  just and lasting solution to the conflict.The situation in Afghanistan continues to concern us greatly despite the successful conclusion of the Geneva Agreements in April 1988 aid the total withdrawal from that country of Soviet troops. While to date the Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have properly applied aid implemented these Agreements both in spirit and in letter  it is to be regretted that the other signatory countries have not suitably honoured their commitments ad have chosen to torpedo them deliberately  which means that Afghanistan at this time is in the grip of a murderous  fratricidal war which sows devastation and grief among the innocent civilian population  the consequences of which will reverberate well beyond the borders of that coin try.The climate of understanding which developed last year in the Maghreb also encouraged the hope that the problem of Western Sahara would see a happy  acceptable solution through constructive and steady dialogue guaranteeing the courageous Sahraoui people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.As for the situation in southern Africa  we are pleased with the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia under the leadership of the courageous South west Africa People's Organization (SWAEO). However  it is deplorable that given this positive development the Pretoria regime still continues to practise the inhuman and criminal policy of apartheid against the black African population and the front-line States.In Latin America and the Caribbean we appreciate to the full the efforts of the Contador a Group and its Support Group and their contribution to peace. The Guatemala Agreement of 7 August 1987 and the Tela Declaration of 7 August 1989 which followed testify to the will of the peoples of this region to reach a peaceful settlement of their conflicts without external interference. Any attempt to supply assistance to the contras in Nicaragua aid to carry out policies of coercion and blockade against other countries by any foreign Power will merely seriously compromise the peace efforts.  In the Indian Ocean region  the existence of military bases of foreign Peers equipped with nuclear weapons is a constant threat to the independence and security of littoral ad hinterland states. The convening of the International Conference on the Indian Ocean  in accordance with the decision of the General Assembly of the United nations  thus remains necessary  indeed essential in order to guarantee Peace and to promote cooperation among peoples.The Lao People's Democratic Republic welcomes supports the initiative taken by the coastal countries of the Mediterranean to transform that region into a zone of peace  security end cooperation free of  y foreign military presence.  AS regards the situation in Cyprus  the Government and people of Laos commend the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations whose mission of good offices has made it possible for the people of the two Cypriot co-unities to begin the process of direct negotiations in order to achieve a just and lasting solution to the problem dividing them.In the Middle East  the situation remains disturbing  owing to the intensification of the occupying Power's implementation of a repressive policy against Palestinian Arabs in the occupied territories. The popular uprising - the intifadah - which  is the expression of the determination end courage of the oppressed Palestinian people  certainly enjoys the sympathy and firm support of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. We also support my initiative aimed at the urgent convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East  with the Participation of the Palestine Liberation Organisation on an equal footing with the other parties directly concerned.In the Korean peninsula  the artificial division imposed from outside and the presence of foreign armed forces in its southern part are the major obstacles tothe peaceful ramification of Korea. Any attempt to admit either part of Korea to the United Nations will merely complicate the situation.se situation in South-East Asia has currently become the main focus of international public opinion. It will be recalled that each year during the debate on the question of Kampuchea in the Assembly  some claim that the withdraw of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia is a sine qua non for the settlement of this question. Now  that withdrawal has been fully effected. It was concluded less than a week ago in the presence of many international delegations and with  the world's mass media. It was carried out in accordance with the timetable established by the State of Cambodia. But the situation in that country remains unclear  owing to the attempts by some to help Cambodian factions and by other: to return the genocidal Pol Pot regime to power through so-called power-sharing. Meanwhile  the Khmer Rouge have already resumed their recidivist action in the field against innocent civilians  thus terrorizing all foreign nationals  including Laos  in that country. At the military level  convinced that the Vietnamese retreat will weaken the State of Cambodia  the armed elements of the democratic coalition have not hesitated to begin encroaching on the of the latter  particularly in the region of Pailin  near the Khmer-Thai:	Given ail that  it is a mistake  not to say an illusion  on the part of partisans of those who believe that  after the Vietnamese withdrawal from rebel forces will be able to seize some of the land in order to negotiate from a position of force. The case is the same in Afghanistan.Given such a situation  can we  as supporters of peace and stability  remain indifferent? The Jakarta Informal Meetings were of the view that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is linked to the non-return of the genocidal Pol Pot clique to power and to the halting of foreign assistance to Cambodian parties  in order toavert civil war and to promote national reconciliation. The international Paris Conference that accompanied those meetings led to new positive elements. At this stage of development  we still need to find the meat reasonable means for translating those well-known formulas into actions  to prevent the resumption of armed hostilities  and to avoid actions that might alienate the efforts of countries in the region and those of the co-chairmen of the Paris Conference  who have striven tirelessly to unite the Cambodian parties round a table. My delegation appeals for a turn to the better and for a display of realism.As for the situation in my country  the Lao People's Democratic Republic  we have seen new  positive developments following the adoption a few years ago of a policy of openness consisting of promoting and encouraging foreign investment through the subsequent restructuring of various administrative and juridical branches able to respond to that new need. This policy  it is generally felt  has contributed actively to improving the climate of relations among countries in the region. It is also comforting to stress here that relations between my country and Thailand are steadily improving  although the border dispute has not yet been settled definitively.The international political climate has certainly improved over the last few years. However  contrary to expectations and hopes  the world economy continues to go through a serious crisis in its development. Ear from resolving itself  the present structural crisis in tine world economy offers an uncertain future. In fact  the crushing burden of debt continues to oppress the third world. Commodity prices continue to plunge  terms of trade have deteriorated  aid discriminatory practices against the exports of developing countries have further increased. In that truly disastrous external environment  developing countries have undertakenlarge-scale reforms and have agreed to broad adjustment measures  which have in certain cases entailed extremely high social and political costs. Those countries deserve the full support aid sympathy of the international community. It is true that a certain degree of recovery has been noted in certain Western developed countries  but that has had scant influence on the effort to improve the health of the world economy.In the light of today's reality  when the interdependence of States is more obvious than ever before  international economic problems can be solved only if we co-ordinate our actions and if we all  developed and developing countries  act together. For in the new age no country or group of countries can by itself develop and protect itself from the repercussions of world social  economic and ecological problems. In that spirit we support a united and multilateral approach to seeking lasting and effective solutions to present-day problems. If that goal is to be attained  there is a pressing need for serious and constructive dialogue between North and South to begin  and from that viewpoint everything should be done to ensure the success of the special session of the General Assembly  planned for April 1990  devoted to international economic co-operation  and particularly to the resumption of the developing countries growth and economic development.At a time when the world economy is facing an unprecedented crisis  certain industrial countries are continuing to adopt coercive measures against third-world countries  in violation of ethical principles and of the relevant United Nations resolutions. The international community must do all it can to put an immediate end to such unfair practices.The drug problem  one of the greatest  scourges of the century  continues to be a source of world concern. The Lao Government fully shares that concern and has taken various measures designed  on the one hand  to bring a gradual halt to the traditional cultivation of poppy by those who engage in such cultivation and  on the other hand  to replace it by a substitute crop. We have developed projects for co-operation in this sphere with such international organizations as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNEDAC)  as well as with various interested countries. We plan to expand that co-operation  which should be based on strict respect for the independence andsovereignty of each State. It is true that in the struggle against drug abuse the non-production of narcotics is of great importance. However  the effective response to the problem is reduction and elimination of demand. The most powerful drug cartels in the world will ultimately founder if all of our children learn just to say ""No"" to drugs.In conclusion  my delegation wishes to assure the President that he will have our full co-operation and that we shall work in a constructive spirit with other delegations to contribute to the success of this session of the General Assembly."
"82",4010,"LBR",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of Liberia and on my own behalf  I congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your unanimous election to this high office is a tribute not only to Nigeria and Africa but also to your outstanding personal qualities as a statesman. The wealth of diplomatic experience and proven negotiating skills you bring to this assignment fully assure us of the successful conclusion of our deliberations and the efficient management of the affairs of the Assembly over the next 12 months.Furthermore  given the very cordial and long-standing brotherly relations between our two countries  you can rest assured of my delegation's complete support and co-operation. We recall with satisfaction the very close working relationship which existed between the delegations of Nigeria and Liberia in 1969  20 years ago  when my country  represented by Mrs. Angie Brooks-Randolph  had the distinction of occupying the high position of President of the General Assembly.Let me also pay a wellâdeserved tribute to your distinguished predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the effective manner in which he conducted the work of the forty-third session. We wish him Godspeed in all his future endeavours.  Allow me  finally  to extend to our illustrious Secretary-General sincere thanks for the outstanding performance of the Secretariat since the last session of the General Assembly. His many initiatives in  and continuing personal commitment to  the search for world peace and understanding deserve the highest commendation and approbation of the Assembly.The establishment of the United Nations 44 years ago marked the beginning of a new era in international relations. By adopting its Charter and instituting a working system of international co-operation  we resolved to eradicate the scourge of war  to strengthen peace through justice and international law  to respect the equal rights of all nations  large and small  to promote social progress and to protect human rights throughout the world.In this regard the United Nations has become increasingly a centre for harmonising the efforts of nations in the attainment of the common aspirations of the international community.The convening of these annual sessions has thus provided theÂ® opportunity not only to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism but also to explore new ways of transforming our hopes for solidarity into concrete action for peace and development.It is against this background that  while taking note of the continuing improvement in super-Power relations that has further reduced global tension  my delegation must none the lees register its grave concern that since we last assembled hare most of the regional conflicts that appeared to be on the verge of resolution have continued to defy settlement.For example  in Afghanistan  civil war rages on despite the Geneva Agreements; in Lebanon  a resurgence of sectional and factional strife continues to be fuelled by the presence of foreign forces; in Iran and Iraq  differences in interpretation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) have stalled the process towards a peaceful settlement; in the Middle East  the fighting goes on and tension remains high as various peace initiatives have been rejected; in Kampuchea the announced withdrawal of foreign forces has not materially changed this situations and so on.In the meantime  most delegations at the forty-fourth session of the Genera! Assembly have highlighted  as they have done in the past  their respective Government's position on each of these and other regional conflicts. Pursuant to this tradition therefore  the Liberian delegation  in its turn  wishes to state its position  as follows;In respect of the situation in the Middle East  my Government maintains that a just and lasting settlement must take into account the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination  as well as the rights of all other States in the region  including Israel  to exist in secure and internationally recognized boundaries.In the meantime  while the many enlightened peace initiatives that have been proposed  including the most recent by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt  constitute very useful contributions to the search for a solution  my delegation wishes to reiterate our call for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  with equal participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the authentic representative of the Palestinian people  We are convinced that such a conference would enhance the process leading to a durable peace in the region.The factional strife in Lebanon  which has continued unabated  remains of grave concern to my Government  not least because of the very close relations which Liberia has enjoyed with that country over the years. We therefore support the call for withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon  respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity and the safeguarding of its independence. In this connection  we commend the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab Heads of State  which It is to be hoped will contribute towards ending the sufferings of the Lebanese people.Haiti respect to the problem of Kampuchea  we note that  while the recent Paris International Conference on Cambodia achieved progress in elaborating a wide variety of elements necessary for reaching a settlement  it was not possible to achieve a comprehensive political solution. My delegation therefore continues go support the call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country under international supervision  to enable the Kampuchean people exercise their inalienable right to self-determination through free and fair elections.The renewed commitment of the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities would be a positive step in the right direction towards resolving the Cyprus question.In this regard  the efforts of the Secretary-General  in compliance with the mandate of good offices entrusted to him by the Security Council  continue to be most useful and should be fully utilized by the two sides to obtain an overall settlement  taking into consideration the legitimate interests and concerns of both communities.The Secretary-General in his report (A/44/1) points to further constructive developments towards ending the dispute in Western Sahara and the acceptance  with some remarks and contents  of the peace plan presented to the parties by himself and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. While accepting that some time will be required for the implementation of the plan  we urge both parties to muster the political will necessary for solution of this problem.In connection with Korea  we encourage the resumption of dialogue between South Korea and North Korea with a view to easing tension. Furthermore  we believe that membership of the two Koreas in the United Nations should broaden the scope for their peaceful reunification.With respect to Central America  significant developments have taken place which point towards prospects for peace in that region. The recent signing of the Tela Accord by five Central American Presidents is yet another manifestation of commitment to the undertakings assured under the Esquipulas II agreement by the Governments and peoples of Central America.Having summarized Liberia's position on these regional conflicts  we are convinced that there is now a need for the international community to go beyond these annual restatements of positions and muster the necessary courage to accept the rule of law as the basis not only for the settlement of disputes  but indeed for the conduct of international relations as a whole.In our view  quite apart from manâs selfish nature and his insatiable greed for power end wealth  the one factor that means to underlie most  if not all  regional conflicts  is man's failure to accept international law as an effective instrument for the achievement and maintenance of world peace and security.That is why my delegation fully endorses the call of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries for a declaration of the 1990s as a decade on international law  to focus world-wide attention on the indispensable role of the rule of law in the search for peace. It is our hope that the Assembly will adopt this proposal and will formulate an appropriate programme of action for its implementation.A related matter of great concern to Liberia is the question of respect for human rights  the promotion of which constitutes a fundamental objective of this organization. In this connection  we consider racist South Africa's policy of apartheid the most flagrant violation and abuse of human rights anywhere.Despite the repeated appeals and protestations of the international community  the racist engine in Pretoria continues to perpetrate against the black majority the most horrendous atrocities  including all forms of torture and forcible removal of families and whole communities from their homes to live in so-called Bantustans under harsh conditions of deprivation and despair.Furthermore  the state of emergency  deliberately designed to crush the resistance of the opponents of apartheid  has been extended foe yet another year to facilitate  inter alia  illegal detention  including of women and children. Bans and restrictions against anti-apartheid leaders  organizations and liberation movements remain in full force and effect.The persistence of these conditions  which we have always described as resembling those obtaining in Nazi concentration an 3 torture camps  makes all the more urgent the need for the international community to take concerted action to end the abhorrent system of apartheid  considered by this Organisation as a crime against humanity.My delegation continues to insist that the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions as laid down in Chapter VII of the Charter constitutes the last viable peaceful means of ending the explosive situation in South Africa.It is ironic that these who ceaselessly advocate respect for human rights should be the very ones who continue to embolden the perpetrators of the system of apartheid by arguing that sanctions could only bring untold hardship and suffering to the black population and to the front-line States. But everyone knows that such arguments represent a mere pretext by these collaborators of the racist regime who may be interested more in securing profit on their investments than in protecting the human rights of the oppressed black people of South Africa.Be that as it may  in our view the new minority Government in Pretoria does have a real chance to restore the human rights off the black majority and establish a non-racial democratic government. If its professed good intentions are to be taken seriously  however  the racist regime will have immediately to take the following minimum actions laid down by the international community: it must effect and unconditional release of all political prisoners and detainees  including Nelson Mandela; it must lift the ban and restrictions on all proscribed organizations and persons} and it must end the state of emergency and commence dialogue and negotiation with authentic non-white leaders.At the forthcoming special session on apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa  to be held in December this year  my delegation will seize the opportunity to address further this vexing issue. Meanwhile  we wish to reaffirm our support for the Harare Declaration off 21 August 1989  adopted by the Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa off the Organization off African Unity  intended to eradicate apartheid and establish peace in the region.The role of ay country in the independence struggle of Namibia began three decades ago. It can be recalled that  in association with the brotherly State of Ethiopia  the Government of Liberia in 1960 filed suite before the International Court of Justice contesting South Africa's right to administer Namibia and to impose upon that Territory its policy of apartheid. We have come a long way since then and are gratified by the progress which has been achieved thus far toward ending the illegal colonial domination of Namibia.However  there can be no room for complacency in view of repeated manoeuvres by South Africa to circumvent full compliance with the provisions of resolution 435 (1978). We maintain that that resolution must be implemented in its original and definitive form to ensure that the people of Namibia participate freely  without intimidation  in the electoral process  under the supervision and control of the United Nations. In this connection  my delegation takes this opportunity to extend special thanks to the Secretary-General for his vigilance in the implementation of resolution 435 (1978)  and urges him to continue his efforts  in pursuit of which we pledge our fullest co-operation and support.Turning now to the issue of disarmament  Liberia maintains that  if peace and development are to be fully achieved  the world simply cannot continue to spend over one trillion dollars annually on armaments and related activities. The international community must therefore intensify its efforts towards disarmament  so that funds released in the process could be allocated to improving the world's socio-economic situation  particularly in developing countries.In the meantime it my be recalled that my Government last year welcomed the ratification of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Ranges Missiles - INF Treaty - by the super-Powers as a positive step in the disarmament process. Likewise  this year also we wish to welcome the recent progress achieved by the United States and the Soviet Union on conventional and strategic arms reduction. Notwithstanding these positive bilateral initiatives  however  we must reiterate that disarmament is a concern of the international community as a whole  and should be undertaken comprehensively within the framework of the United Nations with all countries participating on the basis of equality.In this regard we recall with satisfaction the high-level Conference on chemical weapons held in Paris last January  which reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of chemical weapons and stressed the need to intensify multilateral negotiations on a convention not only to ban the production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons  but also to destroy all existing stocks. That Conference was a step in the right direction. However grave the global economic situation  of equal concern to my delegation is the growing incidence of environmental degradation. But before I address the problem of the environment and the economy let me first reflect briefly on a few social issues of critical importance to the international community  such as the problems of drug abuse  terrorism and hostage-taking  and the special problems of children  as addressed in the draft convention on the rights of the child.With regard to the last of these the Liberian Government believes that the draft convention contains important safeguards for the protection of children  and we therefore call for its adoption during this session of the Assembly.Liberia is also concerned about the growing wave of terrorism which puts innocent lives at risk and has the effect of impairing normal intercourse between nations and peoples. We deplore the abduction of individuals and hostage-taking as acts which deprive people of their fundamental human rights. In this respect my Government will continue to lend its co-operation to efforts by the United Nations and other international bodies aimed at completely abolishing terrorism and hostage-taking.The Government of Liberia is similarly concerned about the alarming incidence of drug trafficking and drug abuse  which have already destroyed and continue to ruin countless lives and have undermined the integrity and stability of Governments. The monetary value of the illicit drug trade  which according to estimates far exceeds that of the international trade in oil and is second only to that off the arms trade  underscores the difficulty involved in the eradication of this pernicious global problem.Consequently we must commend those Governments that have taken bold action to prevent and eradicate drug trafficking and drug abuse. But since  as we know  the illicit trade in drugs transcends national boundaries and involves for its success not only producers but  to an even greater extent  consumers  it is the collective responsibility of the international community to find an urgent solution to this menace before it is too late. Nowadays  environmental degradation occupies a very high position on the agenda of virtually every international conference  as well it should. For what is at stake here is nothing short of the continuing existence off life on this planet. Indeed  the depletion of the ozone layer  global warming as a result of the greenhouse effect  desertification and toxic waste rank among the most immediate of our concerns as regards their effect on the ecosystem.Particularly  though  my delegation wishes to focus attention on the dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes on the territories of developing countries. In this connection we must register our disappointment that the Basel Convention  adopted in March 1989  does not address all the issues of interest to us on this subjectâ For instance  the Convention is inadequate in prohibiting transboundary movements of these wastes  contrary to the intent of the Organization of African Unity (OAIJ)  which in a recent resolution has determined that dumping of hazardous wastes is a crime against Africa and its peoples. Accordingly  that resolution goes on to appeal to OAU member States not to enter into agreements that would permit the dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes within their borders.As developing countries in general lack the technical capability to ensure effective control and disposal of hazardous wastes  it is necessary to effect a total ban on transboundary movements of these wastes. For its part  ray Government has enacted laws banning the dumping of toxic wastes on Liberian soil  prescribing penalties no less stringent than those in the 1989 Basel Convention. As a regional attempt to find solutions to this problem  a workshop held in Monrovia from 8 to 12 May 1989 recommended  inter alia  the establishment of a third-world bureau on environmental protection with certain clearly defined functions.In a broader context  my delegation supports the proposal made by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi at the Belgrade summit of non-aligned countries for the establishment of a planet protection fund. By the same token we welcome the proposal of the Prime Minister of New Zealand  presented in his statement to the assembly  for the establishment of an environmental protection council within the United Nations system. These proposals warrant the serious and timely consideration of the Assembly.Finally  since the developed countries are the prima source of environmental degradation it is only fair and proper that they shoulder a greater share of the responsibility for global environmental protection  including the provision of adequate resources for that purpose. In this connection their development assistance to and investment programmes in third-world countries should now be designed to ensure sustainable development at no extra cost to these countries  and the developed countries should not begin to impose any form of environmental conditionalities on resource transfers to the developing countries.To conclude on this point  permit me to recall that the question of the environment goes beyond toxic wastes. There are also issues of the ozone layer  the greenhouse effect and desertification - to name a few - which warrant the urgent attention of the international community. In this light the proposed international conference on environment and development  to be held in 1992  should go a long way towards addressing the issues.While the world community has of late witnessed a thaw in super-Power relations  the resulting easing of tension and improvement in the political climate have shown no sign of relieving the desperate economic plight of developing countries. Living standards in third-world countries continue to decline as a result of the current hostile economic environment  which is characterised mainly by a crushing external-debt burden  a drastic fall in commodity prices  deteriorating terms of trade  and the increasingly protectionist stance of developed countries. We find it rather unacceptable that more than 1 billion people in our world today should be chronically undernourished  and that 13 million to 18 million of them die each year from hunger and starvation  40 per cent being children. It is no less alarming that nearly as many people should be illiterate this far into the twentieth century.As we know  such problems are not due to the lack of resources  but more to the persistence of an unjust international economic order which appears to thrive on exploitation and the inequitable distribution of the world's resources.How else can the present phenomenon of developing countries being net transferers of resources to developed countries be explained? According to the 1989 annual report of the World Bank  the net resource transfer to the developed countries  which amounted to $10.2 billion in 1984  has readied a staggering $50 billion today  with a total debt stock estimated at $1.3 trillion.Meanwhile  the developed countries of the industrialized North  both in the East and the West  appear to be concerned primarily with consolidating their already strong grip on the world economy. Not only have their economies registered consistent growth over the last decade; these countries have now embarked upon wide-ranging reforms aimed at their closer integration. Eastern Europe's new perestroika is providing the basis for tighter links to the free market economies of the West  and the Group of Seven could soon be due for expansion towards the East. At the same time  Canada and the United States have initiated a free trade agreement  while Western Europe moves steadily towards a single market in 1992.What are the implications of all of this consolidation in the North? Do these and similar moves in the developed countries promise new opportunities of expanded markets for the primary commodities and the few industrial products of the developing countries? Or do they portend further protectionist tendencies against the developing countries of the South en an even grander scale?These concerns on the part of my delegation arise not from any desire to be confrontational; far from it. In fact  Liberia has always espoused dialogue and co-operation over dispute and conflict. Our concern stems rather from the current stalemate in global negotiations  which renders prospects for any solution to the critical economic problems facing developing countries quite distant and uncertain. That is why my delegation fully supports the call of the Organisation of African Unity and the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement for a resolution of the North-South dialogue to address these problems.None the less  while awaiting the resumption of that dialogue  we believe that the countries of the South will have to realize that  in the words of Nwaliau Julius Nyerere  Chairman of the South Commission:""The only people responsible for the development of the South and the freedom of the South are the Governments and peoples of the South"". In this connection  my delegation considers that the time is now for the developing countries to make good their avowed commitment to South-South co-operation in a spirit of collective self-reliance  even in their dealings with the North.It is in this light also that Liberia welcomes the decision of the States of our region to evolve an African alternative framework for structural adjustment  tailored to our own situation. No doubt this approach will be useful to other regions in making structural adjustment more relevant.I cannot end this portion of my statement  however  without paying tribute to the United Nations for its tireless efforts in promoting a better standard of living for peoples throughout the world. We thus welcome the decision to convene a special session of the General Assembly in April 1990 to consider strategies for the reactivation of economic growth  particularly in developing countries. That session will no doubt prove useful in preparations being made for the ensuing fourth development decade of the United Nations. As we enter the last decade of the twentieth century  mankind is faced with challenges  old and new  requiring nothing less than the concerted action of the international community.The continuing economic crisis in developing countries  the persisting threats to peace  the escalating incidence of drug abuse and other social ills  the rising tide of racists and human rights violation even in developed countries  and the increasing pollution of the environment - all such problems can best be resolved if they are addressed at all levels of international co-operation. In this context  whatever its shortcomings and imperfections  the United Nations remains the most appropriate forum and instrument for the harmonization of national efforts towards the attainment of durable peace and sustainable development in our world.We therefore reaffirm our full commitment to the strengthening of this organization  thereby to contribute to making it all the more effective in the pursuit oÂ£ its aims and objectives in the years ahead."
"83",4056,"LBY",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  permit me at the outset to convey to you the sincere congratulations of my country's delegation on your election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. It is an honour to our African continent that you have been chosen for this esteemed position. I am also pleased  because you belong to a friendly State which maintains strong historic and cultural relations with mine. I have every confidence that your qualities and rids experience will help us to achieve the desired results of this session.It also gives me pleasure to express the appreciation and gratitude of the Libyan Arab delegation to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for his competent and commendable handling of the work of the previous session.I should also like to express our great appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Pere2 de Cuellar  for his sincere efforts to advance the ideals of the United Nations and for the initiatives he has taken to improve the performance of the Organization and peacefully resolve the complex problems facing the international community.Despite problems and political pressures  the United Nations has proved that it really deserves our confidence  and that it can accomplish much of what we aspire to as an international group  if we have the will to create the appropriate climate for the Organization.The United Nations is the embodiment of our common will to close our ranks in working for the realization of the deeply cherished aspirations of mankinds namely  peace  freedom  justice and prosperity A cursory look at the world today  which is beset with problems and issues that accumulate year after year  shows clearly that we are regrettably far from making any real progress towards the noble purposes for whose achievement the United Nations was established.The reasons for the continuing erosion of the Organization's potential are well known. Thus the declaration issued by the Ninth Summit Conference of Heads of States or Government of the Movement of NonâAligned Countries has expressed our concern about the realities of the Organization and voiced our hopes for its future when it states that: ""Despite all challenges  the United Nations system has stood the test of time. Even those who are still ignoring the United Nations as a forum for collective action of States have increasingly realized that this Organization is an indispensable means to regulate international disputes and to endeavour to solve international problems â.."".In another section  the declaration continues:""To this end  we shall endeavour to strengthen the machinery of the United Nations and to revitalize  expand and co-ordinate its activities ..."". The Charter  which should guide our work  Is constantly being flouted: areas of tension are spreading; dangers are becoming more acute. This stems from the insistence of certain Powers to give the policies of force  intimidation and terrorism the upper hand over the spirit of co-operation  understanding and constructive dialogue.There are many persistent violations of the Charter  the most serious of which glares at one at the entrance to this building  where the flags of the most repulsive regimes known in modern history are hoisted  namely  the apartheid regime in South Africa and the racist Zionist entity in occupied Palestine. These two regimes are closely related; they represent a challenge to moral principles and right. I believe that as an international group we should not tolerate a falsehood that we can change if we so desire.Major developments have taken place in the international arena since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. The current international situation is different from that of 194 5. Thus we appeal for serious collective action to strengthen the role of the Organization. This we believe  will require the review of those provisions of the Charter which are inconsistent with existing international circumstances.We urge the Special Committee on the Charter and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization to move from the consuming phase of consideration and discussion to the phase of proposing practical solutions and of submitting specific proposals on the provisions that cripple the Organization's effectiveness.Worthy of note among these provisions is the veto privilege  which has become an insurmountable obstacle to international unanimity. That privilege has been abused by some of the States that enjoy it. They use it not to defend what is right and to preserve international peace and security  but to consecrate falsehood and promote aggression  occupation  invasion and terrorism. My country  which is honoured to have taken the initiative in calling for a review of the veto privilege  reaffirms its resolute stand on this issue.We have great faith in the United Nations and in its ever-more essential role. We believe that the strong and united will of peace-loving nations can help the Organization achieve the desired effectiveness. It alone can deter those who espouse policies of threats and force.My country has suffered from detestable imperialist practices  past and present. At the beginning of this century it was subjected to hateful fascist invasion  occupation and colonialism  during which it suffered from all forms of oppression  destruction and attempts at genocide.During the Second World War  the Libyan territory became a major battlefield and our people paid an exorbitant material and human price. Although the war ended for its principal parties  its vestiges - the mines and other war materiel left behind by the warring forces with no consideration for the inhabitants of the country - continue to plague us. Libyans still suffer material and human losses as a result of them. Years ago  we took the initiative and raised the problem in the General Assembly  which adopted numerous resolutions calling upon the States responsible for deploying and leaving those deadly weapons to provide all necessary information  help in their removal and compensate for the human and material damage caused by them. Today  through this forum  we renew our appeal to theinternational community to urge the States concerned to act in a responsible manner and implement the provisions of the Assembly's resolutions.My country is just an examples the phenomenon is much wider in scope. The States which invaded and colonized our countries  exploited our economic and human resources and fought over our territories in the past should shoulder the historic responsibility of atoning for their acts. Thus we urge consideration of the question of compensation for invasion and colonial exploitation. The States concerned must take moral responsibility as the point of departure in considering this issue. Compensation for colonialism is the least we can expect of imperialist States. We must realize that the problems facing many States in the developing world today were caused by the suffering of their peoples during the periods of invasion and colonialism.As the Ninth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries declared in its special paper on decolonization ""The Heads of State or Government called upon all former and present imperialist Powers to shoulder their responsibilities and pay all due compensation for the economic  social and cultural consequences of colonizing developing countries."" Perhaps the most repulsive act to which my country has been exposed was the direct military aggression launched in the spring of 1986 against our peaceful cities by a super-Power which is also a permanent member of the Security Council; let alone the repeated provocative and hostile actions perpetrated against us by that State since the early 1980s. It has also imposed economic  scientific and cultural boycott measures against us  which is entirely unjustifiable.The international community has rejected and condemned those practices. This was reflected in General Assembly resolution 41/38  which affirmed that the aggressive State pay compensation for material and human losses incurred as a result of treacherous acts of aggression. Today  we once again strongly call upon the international community to urge the aggressive State to shoulder its responsibilities and comply with this resolution and implement its provisions without delay.My country  as one of the States bordering the Mediterranean basin  attaches great importance to the question of strengthening security and co-operation in that region. We have constantly called for making the Mediterranean basin ""a zone of peace""  for we are fully aware that peace and security in the region is closely related to international peace and security. The Mediterranean has become one of the most dangerous areas of tension in the world because of Zionist practices in and around occupied Palestine and because of the insistence of certain imperialist Powers on transforming the Mediterranean into a base for foreign military fleets and an arena for manoeuvres  provocation  including acts of air and naval piracy  as well as a launching pad for acts of direct aggression against certain States.My country is committed to working to support regional and international efforts to bring about effective security and co-operation in the Mediterranean region. As we applaud the persistent efforts made by the States members of the Non-Aligned Movement in the region  we renew our call for other littoral States of the Mediterranean to discharge their responsibilities and enter into a meaningful and balanced dialogue to establish strong and lasting bases for co-operation. We believe that achieving these objectives begins with a common conviction of the need to take collective measures  among which priority should be given to ending racist Zionist practices in occupied Palestine and demanding the immediate withdrawal of military fleets from  and the dismantling of foreign bases in  the region.The issues of human rights command great attention in our country. This arises from an unfaltering belief that respect for human dignity is the basis for peoples* progress and prosperity. This respect derives from a culture and a religion whose central theme is respect for man and humanity. Allah stated in the Holy Koran:""We have honoured the sons of Adam; provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favours  above a great part of our creation."" (The Holy Koran  XVII.-70) Human dignity is realized by observing principles  first and foremost among which is equality as a common human value. Islam decrees that all people are equal ""as the teeth of a comb"" - that no distinction should be made except that based on competence  work and what each person offers to his God  to himself  his country and humanity. Thus Islam abolished the caste and class systems - discrimination based on differences related to ancestral claims  kinship and colour. In this context Allah said:""Oh mankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and female  and made you into nations and tribes  that ye may know each other. Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of God is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And God has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things). (The Holy Koran  XLIX:13)The Prophet - peace be upon him - said in his farewell pilgrimage sermon in which he drafted a constitution for mankind:""Oh ye people  verily your God is One  and your father is one. All mankind is the progeny of Adam who was fashioned out of clay. The noblest of you in the sight of Allah is the one who is most God-fearing. There is no superiority for an Arab over a non-Arab and for a non-Arab over an Arab  nor for the white over the black  nor for the black over the white except in piety."" The words of the just Caliph Omar Ibn A1 Khattab will echo throughout time  for having admonished one of the administrators under his caliphate: ""Since when have you reduced people  who were born free  into servitude.1""In March 1988  Libya took major practical and legal steps to protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels. The year 1989 witnessed developments that reinforced our accomplishments. Early this year  the Freedom Consolidation Act was adopted and accession to a large number of international conventions in the field of human rights was ratified. Moreover  the International People's Committee on the Qadaffi Prize for Human Rights was established. This summer my country hosted the first meeting of that committee  during which the Qadaffi Prize for Human Rights was awarded to the African freedom fighter Nelson Mandela.We are determined to continue supporting efforts of the international community through the United Nations and its bodies concerned with human rights to attain the lofty aims cherished by humanity. In this respect  we stress that the racist practices in occupied Palestine and South Africa represent an outrageous defiance of the will of the international community and an intolerable contempt for human rights.The Palestine question is at the top of the list of issues that concern the international community  even though certain quarters wish otherwise. This priority is given not only because the Palestine question involves real threats to international peace and security  but also because it is a defiance of ethical values and an attack on rights  in contempt for all values. This question is still the main concern of my country. We believe that night  however long it nay be  is followed by day; injustice  however prolonged it may be  must come tc an end. The people's struggle derives from the will of Allah and this must be victorious.The intifadah of the Palestinian people against Zionist occupation  which has been going on for nearly two years  has reminded the world once again of this people's tragedy. The barbaric practices of Zionists against unarmed children and women - unarmed except  perhaps  with stones - reveal the true nature of Zionism and prove that the aim of Zionist terrorists and those who  ack them is the eradication of the Palestinian people as a first step to attaining objectives that target the very existence of a nation.The uprising - the intifadah - has also proven that it is impossible to suppress a people's will to attain its lawful aspirations and that any separate  or even international  attempts to make peace deals that run counter to that people's will cannot achieve success.Our stand on this question emanates from our compliance with international instruments  morality and the dictates of national duty. Our stand is a firm and clear one-. We fully support the struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate its territory  enjoy its right to self-determination and establish an independent state on the whole Palestinian territory  with Jerusalem as its capital.It is incumbent on the international community to shoulder its historic responsibility of restoring rights to those lawfully entitled to them. The United Nations  which has conferred legality on the occupying Zionist entity at the expense of rights  justice and morality  thus committing an unparalleled historic blunder  is called upon to remedy this situation.The tragic situation in Lebanon is another by-product of the illegal existence of the Zionist entity in our Arab region. My country  which has constantly called for preserving the unity and territorial sovereignty of Lebanon  believes that resolving the Lebanese problem involves primarily the immediate and complete withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces from every inch of Lebanese soil and putting an end to the interference of that entity and other foreign Powers in Lebanese affairs  thus enabling all brotherly Lebanese groups to hold a dialogue in the spirit of fraternity and tolerance.We maintain that the efforts made within the framework of the Arab League - namely the Tripartite Commission - can help our Lebanese brothers overcome their plight. We call upon all peace-loving forces to support these efforts.My country is following with great interest the developments which have taken place since the cease-fire in the Gulf War. It renews its sincere call for the two Muslim States  Iraq and Iran  to respond in a fraternal and Islamic manner to the efforts made by the international community to implement Security Council resolution 5S8 (1987).The Namibian question  which has long been  at the forefront of the political problems facing the international community  has reached a crucial state  that of the cautious anticipation of the intensive international efforts being made to implement Security Council resolution 435 (1978).The Namibian people who have made enormous sacrifices in their struggle are in need of support from the international community today when there are many manoeuvres aimed at creating a situation in Namibia that would enable the apartheid regime to direct at will the results of the elections. My country  which has always provided various forms of political and material support to the Namibian people throughout the period of their heroic and honourable struggle  reiterates its commitment to support the struggle till the Namibian people achieve all their lawful aspirations.While dealing with the current situation in Namibia  we should convey our profound appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his. assistants  especially those working in the field  for their efforts to help the Namibian people achieve true independence.At the previous session  we expressed the hope that the anticipated independence of Namibia would represent a real step towards the elimination of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Today  as we are about to achieve the cherished aim of Namibian independence  we entertain new hopes that this victory will give new and powerful impetus to the struggle of the liberation movement in all its forms  to eradicate the apartheid regime. Because of its firm belief in the cause of freedom and its support for the oppressed  Libya reaffirms its complete willingness to continue its effective contribution with a view to bringing about a comprehensive escalation of the struggle against racists and to attaining victory for the oppressed African people in South Africa.We should not fail to pay a tribute to the peoples of the African front-line States for their enormous sacrifices.In our region  the question of Cyprus has not been resolved. My country wishes to reiterate that a just  lasting and peaceful settlement of this question should be based on the unity  sovereignty and non-aligned status of Cyprus  ridding it of foreign bases as well as guaranteeing the rights of both the Greek and the Turkish communities.As for Afghanistan  my country reiterates its support for all international efforts aiming at preserving the unity of the Afghan people  their sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence. It sincerely urges all our brothers in Afghanistan to resolve their differences in a manner guided by wisdom  fraternity and understanding.My country supports the lawful aspirations of the Korean people to reunify the two parts of their country by peaceful means  without any foreign interference. My country also calls for the dismantling of foreign bases and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.Nuclear and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction represent the main danger that threatens mankind with annihilation. What adds to the complexity of th is issue is the insistence of certain nuclear Powers on engaging in a race to develop and modernize their arsenals at a time when humanity is aware of a certain degree of detente. As regards cessation of the nuclear-arms race  humanity has great expectations.As a signatory of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  the Convention on the Prohibition of Bacteriological Weapons and the Geneva Protocol  my country supports all regional and international endeavours to curb the nuclear-arms race and eradicate nuclear weapons. It also supports all international measures and efforts to prohibit all types of weapons of mass destruction.We lend support to the principle or: establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in any part of the world  including Africa and the Middle East. We believe  however  that this goal will remain out of reach because favourable circumstances have not been created  as there are racist regimes in both South Africa and Palestine. These regimes have co-operated closely and constantly in the field of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.Recently  the Zionist entity was experimenting with long-range missiles in the the Mediterranean when one of the missiles landed near the Libyan city of Benghazi. There is no doubt that the acquisition of these weapons of mass destruction by the Zionist entity threatens the entire region. The history of the Zionist entity  its practices and  above all  the fact that it has attacked Tunisia twice and Iraq once confirm the fact that the security of the entire region is threatened.The United Nations has a special responsibility  for it should not merely draw the attention of the international family to the dangers inherent in the acquisition of these weapons of mass destruction by Israelis  but it should also take the necessary actions to eliminate this threat.There is no doubt that international terrorism is a phenomenon which is a source of grave and growing concern for the international community because it results in the loss of innocent lives and threatens people's peace and security. It also wreaks havoc and undermines confidence on the level of international relations. We share the conviction of the international community concerning the need to combat all forms of international terrorism. As we take up this phenomenon once more at this session  we notice with regret that international endeavours have fallen short of addressing this particular problem. This is due mainly to the fact that there are forms of international terrorism we have neither touched upon nor duly examined. One of these forms of terrorism whose danger has increased is State terrorism. This has prompted my country strongly to support the convening  under the auspices of the United Nations  of an international conference to define the concept of terrorism  and to support the need to develop specific international criteria to ensure that a clear distinction is made between terrorism that should be fought and eradicated on the one hand and the lawful struggle of peoples on the other. We sincerely hope that the legal committee  the Sixth Committee  will be able  during the current session  to take action to enable us to launch an objective and meaningful international dialogue on this issue.My country shares the deep and growing concern of the international community at the grave imbalance in present international economic relations  resulting mainly from the unjust bases on which the international economic order was built. This order took shape under international circumstances which were entirely different from today's realities. Third-world countries  which today represent the majority of the international community  ace suffering from the negative and serious consequences of this imbalance.Numerous manifestations of this suffering can be found in a multitude of problems  of which I shall give a few illustrations: the sharp decline in the prices of commodities  the doubling of the external debt burden of developing countries  the depletion of their financial resources and the prevalence of poverty  famine  disease and excessive protectionism in international trade  as well as the imposition of unfair terms of trade. In addition  economic coercion policies are being adopted by certain developed countries by way of economic embargoes and blockades.This unjust economic order has become an insurmountable obstacle facing developing countries. Hence  the call for the establishment of a new international economic order. This just demand will remain out of reach owing to the obduracy and stubbornness of certain developed countries  whose inflexibility has aggravated and complicated the problems of developing countries especially in the 1980s  which can be termed the lost decade of development.We believe that the developing countries should not be over-optimistic about the results of the so-called North-South dialogue  because the developed countries have shown that they only care for their selfish interests regardless of the urgent needs of the developing countries.Changing the unfair economic order of today's world begins with solidarity and cohesion among those who suffer from injustice and with the promotion of co-operation among them. That is the positive way of attempting to persuade others. I do not deny that this course requires further sacrifices from us that may at first add to our problems  but it remains the only promising approach. To continue to resign ourselves to the existing relationships would mean that we had given up hope.Talking about the world economy leads me to another  closely related issues the question of global environment  which is also of major concern to us all. The world is facing an unprecedented environmental crisis  about which nature is sending us urgent warnings that can be ignored only at our own peril. Numerous and growing indicators of this crisis are all around us. In addition to serious air pollution  there is desertification  soil erosion  depletion of forests  the greenhouse effect  unusual climatic changes and deterioration of the ozone layer. There is also the problem of nuclear and industrial toxic wastes  which has given rise to justifiable concern  especially in the third world  where scheming outsiders would dump such materials.We have a collective responsibility to protect the environment. This surely calls for huge collective efforts; sporadic efforts will not be sufficient to achieve our goals in this field.On the threshold of the twenty-first century  history dictates that we develop our potential and eliminate all the erroneous practices peculiar to the twentieth century. Policies of confrontation  threats and brandishing of power should be abandoned in favour of policies of rapprochement  dialogue  understanding and co-operation to establish the safe and prosperous international community of which our children dream.May God enable us all to achieve that goal."
"84",4088,"LCA",44,1989,"ï»¿Let me express my delight at seeing Ambassador Garba of Nigeria in the Chair as President of the forty-fourth session of the General assembly. He is an experienced and distinguished son of Nigeria. I have no doubt that his well-recognized ability will greatly facilitate our work in the coming months. He may expect nothing less than total co-operation from my delegation.We have come to the end of a historic political decade  in the affairs both of nation States and of the international community at large. In no other decade of this century have we witnessed such a rapid transformation of socio-economic and political philosophies and ideologies. At no other time in recent memory have so many men  once inveterate enemies  been so eager to step forward with pens rather than swords in their hands  anxious to drown past hostilities in ink. Truly in this decade many of us have come close to believing the maxim that the pen is mightier then the sword. It is indeed a time for reflection and stock-taking  and for setting new  greater goals for the future.The decade of the 1980s dawned upon a world wherein dictators of the left and of the right had raised impermeable glass shields of sovereignty at their borders  and with impunity proceeded to violate every human and civil right of their people. We could look in  but could not enter. We listened to the screams but dared not speak. Foe what a man did in his own house was his own business.But as the decade comes to a close X am happy to see the emergence of a greater sense of brotherhood in tine world. ""We the peoples of the United Nations""  the first words of our Charter  are increasingly becoming ""We the family of the United Nations"". And indeed we are drawing closer to the full realization of our ""faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small"".In this decade we have seen signs of progress even in relation to many of our. traditionally most intractable political problems  some as old as  or older than  the organization itself.Since the adoption by the General Assembly at its first session  in 1946  of resolution 65 (I)  the question of Namibia has been on the agenda off every regular session and several special sessions of the General Assembly. And we began this decade with no more hope than we had had when we came to tine end of the proceeding four decades. But as we close the 1980s the United Nations Transition Assistance Group is in plane  and it now seems certain that a free and independent Namibia  emerging out of free and fair elections  will soon take its rightful place  so long denied it  in the comity of nations. Regrettably  the new South African regime  amidst the sending of conflicting signals  continues to hold tenuously to the repulsive apartheid system.All nations of men are made of one blood. And a regime that denies that this is so  and seeks to perpetuate a ridiculous notion of racial superiority by depriving the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa of their fundamental human rights  deserves contempt. We cannot but therefore continue to apply and maintain such pressure as could out an end to their affront to humanity.In the Middle East  too  we have seen policies of naked confrontation  which have bedevilled the Organization almost - since its founding  give way to more reasonable  neither approaches which stress dialogue more than confrontation. The Palestine National Council is to be commended for its decision of 15 November last to accent Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967) and 338 (1973) fully  and consequently Israel's right to exist within secure and internationally recognized borders. The Government of Saint Lucia hopes that the Government of Israel will therefore begin to show greater flexibility in its approach to solving the problems in the Middle East. In this decade we have watched and applauded as General Secretary Gorbachev has tried to move the Soviet Union away from a Kafkaesque and Stalinist society to a country of glasnost and perestroika  as if saying ""let there be light""  and taking the accent away from forced collectivisation and ""group-think"" and placing it on individuality and openness - something only the most optimistic and Utopian of us would have dreamed possible only 10 years ago.In the 1960s we have watched the super-Powers  for decades armed to the teeth and glaring at each other  nod slightly and awake to find that they had concluded a intermediate-nuclear-force agreement and were actually destroying some nuclear weapons - one small step away from mutually assured destruction. The journey of 1 000 miles had begun.In this decade we have watched the authoritarian Government of Poland -dragged reluctantly into expressing solidarity with tine sine of Solidarity do a volte-face and agree to almost total economic and political liberalization. Lavish praise must be heaped upon that Government.In tine 1980s we have watched Afghanistan  though still greatly troubled  begin to move towards a final solution to its problems. So  too  have we witnessed tine end of the fratricidal Iran-Iraq conflict. And in Central America  as Esquipulas II takes hold ballots seem ready to replace bullets in Nicaragua  as dialogue slowly moves to replace brutal confrontation in El Salvador.And in ay own sub-region  the Eastern Caribbean  we are trying to take tine political gains we have made to what we believe are their logical extreme. Being of the view that the highest form of economic co-operation is political integration  sons of us  members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States  will be moving with all deliberate speed towards a federation of our territories. We shall be counting on the support of the international community as we take this bold step. There are still areas where we have failed to make meaningful political progress in the 1980s. In fact  in some places we have seen political regression  as in the beleaguered Lebanon  which seems to be sinking deeper and deeper into a quagmire of political and religious violence. Saint Lucia hopes that the present cease-fire  facilitated by the Arab League  will usher in a new period of peace and reconciliation.. In the People's Republic of China  too  recent events have both shocked and disturbed the world community. Saint Lucia's view is best summed up by a statement issued last July by the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia  the right Honourable John Compton  as follows:""The Government of Saint Lucia is deeply shocked by the Chinese Army's deliberate gunning down  in Tiananmen Square in China  of more than 300 Chinese citizens  the majority of whom were students. The Government believes that this event  one of the most brutal in modern history  makes it imperative for all the nations of the international community  big and small  to unite as one voice to protest the manner in which the expression of human freedom in China has been punished. In this age of human rights and human dignity  it is regrettable that a nation should resort to the use of army tanks and machine-guns to destroy the human spirit in its peaceful quest for freedom and expression. But the human spirit cannot be destroyed! it always resurfaces  and will do so repeatedly in China  until the political system of that country gives way to genuine democracy.""While we have seen some signs of movement towards a constructive dialogue on the question of the reunification of the Korean peninsula  there have been no publicly announced breakthroughs which would lead my Government to believe that the problem will be settled in the very near future. Consequently  Saint Lucia believes that no constructive purpose can be served by any barriers that are kept in the path of either of the two Koreas wishing to become a full Member of the united Nations. Saint Lucia therefore unequivocally supports the desire of the Republic of Korea to become a member of the united Nations family  in the full confidence that it will make an outstanding contribution to the important work of this Organization.Saint Lucia regrets the inability of the recent Paris International Conference on Cambodia to arrive at a comprehensive political settlement. Our position on the Kampuchean question is well known  as we have time and again enunciated it here. It is that the people of Kampuchea should be enabled to choose their own government without outside interference  subversion or coercion. Saint Lucia continues to maintain its position in support of all General Assembly resolutions on the matter.The unsettled political situation in Panama is of great concern to us in Saint Lucia. We continue to support the initiatives of the Panamanian people themselves  and those of the Organization of American States  including the mission appointed by the twenty-first consultative meeting of foreign ministers.In Haiti  too  after years of political oppression and economic denial  the people are struggling to create a genuine democracy as a prelude to meaningful and balanced economic progress. Saint Lucia supports them  and calls upon the entire international community to do likewise. In a statement I made to the press in Port-au-Prince in July I said:""There are different views on whether international aid and the solution of Haiti's many social and economic problems should be a condition precedent for the holding of elections or should await such elections. My colleagues and I are convinced that there is no obvious reason why both sets of efforts. national arid international development efforts  and the taking of concrete steps towards the holding of elections  should not be pursued simultaneously.""In the light of the announcement that local  parliamentary and presidential elections are all to be held next year  my delegation feels justified in urging the international community to renew its aid programme to Haiti  for man cannot live without bread.Undeniably  the 1980s will be remembered for all time as a decade of great political progress on both the domestic and the international front. But  to be sustainable  political liberalization must be coupled with economic  social and scientific progress and prudence  in the South as well as the North. The developed countries cannot expect to succeed in crowning international political progress with North American bilateral trade pacts and European 1992 multilateral economic integration without a supportive reaction  or at the very least a paripassu or lock-step movement  in the developing world.Last year the world economy grew by about 4.3 per cent and world trade increased by about 8.3 per cent  leading to an increase in world output per head of 2.6 per cent. That was beyond all expectations.But in my own region  Latin America and the Caribbean  despite the debt concessions agreed to last year by the Group of Seven and the Paris Club  and despite the proposals made by the Governments of Japan and France and the United States Secretary of the Treasury  Nicholas Brady  all of which have made positive contributions  per capita gross national product has fallen precipitously as debt repayments have risen to more than a quarter of all export earnings. Our aggregate share of world trade has also fallen  as the productivity of labour has declined by about 2 per cent each year of the decade. In the Latin American and Caribbean region alone  it has been estimated  250 000 young children died last year as a direct result of regressions in the development process.Under conditions of extremely tight capital constraints  in 1988 the net transfer of resources from the developing countries exceeded $30 billion. And  especially in Latin America  the crushing debt burden has destabilized some internal economies  affecting both the supply and the velocity of money  and leading to major social conflicts which threaten the political order. Commodity prices  which are essential to most of the developing countries  declined in real terms in this decade by as much as 50 per cent in terms of their purchasing power vis-Ã -vis manufactured goods.  The majority of the least developed countries continue to stagnate  with negative growth rates or growth rates that are too low to keep pace with population growth. Of the 41 least developed countries  only 12 have recorded positive per capita growth over the past few years  with some even experiencing negative gross domestic product growth. In sub-Saharan Africa real income per head has declined almost every year of the decade and is now 14 per cent lower than it was 10 years ago. The continued use in the developed world of non-tariff trade barriers in such an unstable macro-economic environment further threatens the prospect for trade-led growth in the developing countries. Amid a superfluity of indices of increasing growth and prosperity in the world  we are sobered by the fact that average per capita income in the industrialized countries is about 50 times that of the least developed countries. During this decade more than half of the least developed countries implemented structural adjustment programmes with the International Monetary Fund  and those programmes did not always have a human face.In such an economic environment the fundamental principles of the New International Economic Order  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  and the North-South dialogue must remain as valid  important and pressing issues.The wind bloweth where it listeth  but we in the Caribbean are more often than not the victims of its wrath. The destructive impact of hurricane Hugo  which left a wake of disaster as it cut its way across the Caribbean only last month  underscores the extreme physical vulnerability of the island developing countries. Always buffeted by the consequences of smallness  remoteness  lack of natural resources and heavy dependence on imports  we must annually undergo the dreadful ritual of keeping a wary eye on the horizon for hurricanes and cyclones which seek to blow away our small  hard-won economic gains.These problems are especially acute for small island developing countries  which  because of severe geographic and demographic constraints  have developmental problems which are unique  and therefore different from those of developing countries in general. Hence  traditional criteria  such as per capital gross national product  which are used to determine the quantum of aid needs and graduation from concessionary financing  should not apply to small island developing countries without substantial use of supplemental criteria.Saint Lucia therefore looks forward to the holding. next year of the first United Nations conference on special problems and particular needs of island developing countries in the hope that it will give the international community a better understanding of the sui generis situation of the small island developing countries.It cannot be said that the developing countries find themselves in these difficulties because they have not tried to help themselves. In fact  in our efforts towards sustainable growth and development we have looked not only to the North but also to collective self-reliance.Last May  in Caracas  Venezuela  the developing countries celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Group of 77  and welcomed the eight years of the adoption of the Caracas Programme of Action on Economic Co-operation among developing Countries. One month earlier  the global system of trade preferences  the developing world's own most-favoured-nation trading regime  had come into force. Only last month we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the Buenos AiresProgramme of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Co-operation among developing Countries  and adopted measures to strengthen technical co-operation among developing countries. And we look forward to next year's special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation  particularly the reactivation of growth and development of developing countries  when we hope to adopt more concrete measures both in relation to the North and among ourselves. 80  too  we prepare for the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade  which we expect will contain commitments and propose specific policy actions aimed at resolving the serious problem; of the developing countries.In our haste to develop we must not be unaware of the potential environmental consequences of unrequited and irresponsible development.We have all of late been slowly waking to the realization that we are taking a terrible toil on the ecological environment  with destructive consequences that seem almost deliberate. From the maniacal destruction of forests  to the dumping of toxic wastes in the ocean  to the release of fluorocarbons in the atmosphere  we have been destroying the land  sea and air at an astonishing speed  considerably raising carcinogenic dangers to ourselves.In the Anglophone Caribbean  despite the dictates of the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships  we have become increasingly concerned by a series of nefarious attempts by foreign maritime operations to dump toxic substances in the Caribbean Sea in uncomfortable proximity to our shores.Saint Lucia  therefore  supports all international attempts aimed at controlling those problems of runaway pollution  including the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer  and the recent Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal  which was adopted last March.In co-operation with our close neighbours. Saint Lucia plans hotly to pursue  capture and prosecute to the fullest extent of both our national law and international law anyone caught illegally dumping toxic and other dangerous substances in our waters.Our adoption last December of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was timely and  it is hoped  prophetic. Not since the bubonic plaque of the 1340s has mankind faced a social problem with such dire potential consequences for the youth of the global society. The traffickers in illegal narcotic drugs walk on cadavers and broken lives on their way to amassing huge  superfluous fortunes  giving credence to Erasmus's dictum that ""Great abundance of riches cannot be gathered and kept by any man without sin"". It cannot be allowed to continue. though outs is not a producing country  we in Saint Lucia have become more aware of the propensities of international drug traffickers to use the Caribbean as a trans-shipment point on their way to the bigger markets of the north. In this vein Saint Lucia strongly supports the new agenda item proposed by Trinidad and Tobago concerning the establishment of an international criminal court which  inter alia  would have jurisdiction over the transboundary movement of illegal drugs and the idea of an international strike force as proposed by Jamaica.The Government of Saint Lucia within the parameters of the law intends to deal swiftly and harshly with anyone caught distributing or transhipping illegal drugs within its jurisdiction  and to apply without reservation all the provisions of the Convention  including extradition  the granting of mutual legal assistance and  where necessary  transfer of proceedings.This then has been our view of what lies behind us in the past decade and what lies ahead in the final decade of this century. Saint Lucia has pledged itself to reach new economic and social heights in the 1990s  so that we may enter the twenty-first century with confidence; proud of what we have accomplished  and eager to do what we can  however humble  in the years ahead for the global good."
"85",4161,"LKA",44,1989,"ï»¿As Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka  I appear before the Assembly for the first time to speak on behalf of my country. I am very happy to address these few words to the Assembly.Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka  I wish to extend to Mr. Joseph Garba our warmest good wishes and congratulations on his election as President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Sri Lanka has close and cordial relations with Nigeria  not only at the bilateral level but also in the forums of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the Commonwealth  in which we have closely co-operated. I should also like to express our appreciation for the manner in which his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  the Foreign Minister for Argentina  presided over the forty-third session.May I take this opportunity to convey to Ambassador Garba the greetings and good wishes of His Excellency Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa  the President of Sri Lanka  and the people of Sri Lanka and  through him  to all the representatives assembled here today.We live in a time of change  a time of uncertainty  as well as a time of promise and hope. Each of us  the powerful and the weak alike  must respond to the challenge of change. As individual independent States we must provide  in our domestic context  the equality of opportunity  the freedom and the support essential for our citizens to fulfil their aspirations. As a global community  we need to respond collectively to the challenge of rapidly evolving international developments and conduct our political and economic relations with each other to ensure the benefit of the entire world community.The nexus between day-to-day occurrences in our own nations and broader global developments is dramatically brought into focus at the General Assembly each year. Here each representative brings before this parliament of nations the hopes and expectations that motivate his people as well as the fears and frustrations that blight their security and well-being. It is evident in these presentations that what most of us are unable to achieve through our individual and separate endeavours we need to approach as joint ventures in international co-operation. Our national options are often circumscribed by factors that lie beyond our national boundaries. That is equally true of political and economic matters.Developing countries like my own are affected by the momentous transformations taking place at the present time in international economic relations. Science and technology are revolutionizing traditional patterns of industrial activity and production. Centrally planned economic systems are being radically restructured  with decision-making being decentralized and economic freedom being encouraged. A process of integration or globalisation transcending national frontiers isfundamentally transforming financial and other markets. Integration of some key sectors of the world economy has led to a diffusion of economic power and the emergence of new centres of influence. 1992 will usher a new economic force into operation. As part of the relaxation of political tensions  co-operation between systems previously thought to be irreconcilable is further enhancing the process of integration. World economic output in 1988 expanded more than had been expected. International trade and investments grew vigorously.The number of developing countries with growth rates in excess of 5 per cent increased as well  but for most developing countries whose economies have felt the ripples of these trends the economic environment has remained unfavourable  even hostile. Growth rates have stagnated or registered a decline. Prices for the products of developing countries have fluctuated to their detriment. While our products have indeed been competitive  many have nevertheless sustained losses in overall returns  having to contend with forbidding obstacles of quotas  tariff and non-tariff barriers and other restrictions which limit access to markets.One can argue about the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and commitments undertaken in the Uruguay Round aimed at an equitable global system of trade exchanges. The telling reality is  however  that the percentage share of the developing countries in international trade exchanges has deteriorated from about 25 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s to below 20 per cent last year. Trade is a vital life-line for developing countries.At the summit conference of the non-aligned countries in Belgrade  which I attended  the leaders of over 100 States emphasized the vital need for the interests of the developing countries to be adequately reflected in sectors of special importance to them  such as textiles and clothing  agricultural products  tropical products and natural-resource-based products.It is essential that sustained efforts be exerted  including those within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  to stabilize commodity prices at an adequately remunerative level. Reasonable commodity prices and fair market access for developing countries' trade would be more welcome than infusions of aid. What is required is steady  predictable export earnings for developing countries which they could deploy to combat poverty and want.Sri Lanka has initiated innovative methods for the alleviation of poverty by seeking to tap the latent productive energies and rich creativity of the very segments of our population that are most adversely affected. These segments of our population have for too long been considered dependent. The Janasaviya movement - as it is called - has been set in motion to encourage about a million poor families to participate in the national productive endeavour  which could eventually involve even their entry into the export sector as well.One of the main factors in society that makes poverty especially intractable is homelessness. Shanties  slums and other sub-human dwellings: they are the lot of countless millions of people in the developing world today. It is his deep awareness that investment in housing necessarily means disinvestment in poverty that led my President  His Excellency Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa  then Prime Minister  to propose to the General Assembly at its thirty-fifth session that an international year be designated to advance the cause of shelter for the homeless in the world. The international community responded to his call  and 198? became the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless.As part of our own response to the challenge of alleviating poverty in Sri Lanka  we have taken many strides forward in our housing programmes. A programme for constructing 100 000 houses was completed. It was followed by a programme of building 1 million houses. We are now engaged in developing and implementing a programme of building an additional 1.5 million houses. We shall continue to build on these programmes. We shall constantly raise our targets. As the country that proposed international action for ending the scourge of homelessness  we are committed to achieving the United Nations target of shelter for all by the year 2000 ahead of that year.A further initiative being considered by Sri Lanka concerns the development of the resources of the oceans. Despite the rich promise of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  many developing countries have still been unable to reap its full potential owing to insufficient awareness and the lack of national capabilities in the ocean sector. My delegation hopes to present an initiative at the session this year with the objective of launching an endeavour at the global level aimed at the realization of the benefits of ocean development. Sri Lanka looks forward to the suggestions and support of other members.In an adverse economic climate  developing countries faced with the political and social imperative of providing for the well-being of their people have slipped into the deeper and more deadly snare of debt. The external debt of developing countries is new over 31 320 billion. Such astronomically high debts and debt service ratios have exhausted the economies of many developing countries. The situation has indeed deteriorated to such an extent that the net outflow of resources from the developing world to the developed economies exceeds the much-vaunted aid transfusions. At the level of the aggregate of the capital- importing developing countries  1989 will mark the seventh consecutive year of such negative transfers. Sri Lanka  relatively better placed  nevertheless has a rising debt service ratio of 28.7 per cent. This negates what advances have been made in promoting export earnings. It restricts resources for investment  holds back the maintenance and development of infrastructure and inhibits long-term improvements in the economy.Developing countries have also negotiated assistance and support from the major multilateral financial institutions for agreed economic programmes of a remedial or development-oriented nature. Such support  which has undoubtedly brought relief  has not always been available without a heavy price tag to be paid in political and social currency. Assistance and support has been forthcoming only on the basis of prior assent to certain policy prescriptions to be faithfully followed by the recipient State. The formula is familiar: restructuring of sectors of the economy  submission to realistic exchange rates - that is  effective devaluation? liberalization of import regulations? budget austerities compelling reduction or removal of consumer subsidies and other welfare benefits which have cushioned the poor? rationalization of the State sector and perhaps privatisation.Stringent conditionally has been an inevitable element in assistance from multilateral institution::. Compliance often entails the imposition of unbearable economic and social burdens on the people and the real prospect  consequently  of political agitation  unrest and even violence. Nan-compliance  on the other hand  can possibly mean an interruption  or even a cut-off  in support from the institutions concerned. It could also involve a diminution in the country's image of ""aid-worthiness""  with attendant consequences in its bilateral relations with donor countries. Here too  the nexus between political realities and economic exigencies becomes acutely evident. The multilateral institutions would do a major service it they took fuller account of the political and social fallout that awaits a country whose burden of conditionality weighs heaviest on its people.Sri Lanka  with a population of 17 million projected for 1990  won its independence 41 years ago. Its population then stood at 7 million. The decisive leering of the infant mortality rate from 140 per thousand before independence to 39 per thousand in the period 1980-1985 and the rise in life expectancy from 42 years before independence to over 70 years now are indices of the progress made by independent Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's immunization programmes among children  supported by the United Nations Children's Fund  will achieve their targets well before the stipulated date of December 1990. An advanced system of welfare facilities has been available to the population. These include free education  free medical services and subsidized food essentials and transport. A partial scaling-down of some of these facilities  partly brought about by the external environment I have described  a revolution of rising expectations and a complex of other political and social factors have led to frustration and unrest  particularly among our politically articulate youth  who account for about 44 per cent of Sri Lanka's population. Such frustrations have fuelled strong radical views. This has in turn led to a tragic state of violence in our society. A political dialogue to which all parties have been invited is now in progress to reconcile differences in approach to our current problems and to effect a speedy return to normalcy in the island. This situation needs to be differentiated from the developments which painfully forced Sri Lanka into world headlines in the early 1980s.Coupled with ethnic considerations  a dangerous situation had arisen in the northern portions of the island. Violent militant groups within an ethnic minority  the Tamils  sought recourse to terrorism and violence to achieve their ends. It had reached a point in 1987 when  to deal with aspects of the problem which lay beyond our shores  Sri Lanka signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Treaty of July 1987. A measure of stability was felt in the immediate aftermath of the Treaty  when the militant groups agreed to eschew violence aid commence peaceful negotiations to redress their grievances. This period was all too short-lived. Despite the presence of peace-keeping forces sent to Sri Lanka in the context of the Treaty  a period of senseless violence and brutality recommenced in which civilians suffered a terrible toll.An appeal was addressed to all militant groups by the President of Sri Lanka that they enter the mainstream of the peaceful democratic process. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Belam have responded positively  and the Sri Lankan Government is now in the process of pursuing negotiations with its representatives.The Sri Lankan Government has studied with interest the initiative of the Government of the Republic of Maldives in proposing that some mechanism should be devised within the United Nations to support the independence of small States in the event their security is threatened. The threat to small States nay be an external one; more usually  it comes in the form of involvement or intervention inthe internal affairs of small States. As developing countries  most of us face problems of national integration and consolidation. Ensuring social cohesion and harmony is another of our challenges. These problems we must face and resolve by the evolution of our own national life. External inputs dangerously inflame issues. Indeed  what served to aggravate the violence and insecurity of life in the north and east of Sri Lanka in recent years was the external support received by dissident groups. It militarised their campaign. It converted an essentially domestic conflict into one with international ramifications. It added new dimensions to the agony of the peoples of the region.The non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade considered the question of international terrorism in all its forms. Heads of State at the summit noted that terrorism endangered the very territorial integrity and security of States. They called upon all States to fulfil their obligations under international law: obligations to refrain from organizing  instigating  assisting or participating in terrorist acts in other States  or acquiescing in activities within their territories which encourage the perpetration of such acts. An insidious link exists between international terrorism  drug trafficking and the illegal arms trade. Colombia's very survival as a State has been jeopardized by the evil plague of drugs. We applaud the efforts made by the President and Government of Colombia in combating this curse. The community of nations must  on a continuing basis  attack the unholy trinity of terrorism  drug trafficking and the illegal arms trade. The Belgrade summit of non-aligned States supported in principle the convening of a United Nations conference which would  inter alia  define terrorism to distinguish it from the legitimate struggle of peoples for national liberation - a struggle which resolutely continues in Palestine and South Africa.As violence and insecurity continue in the region of the Middle East  support is universal for the convening of the International Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations. The question of Palestine remains at the crux of the prevailing unrest in the Middle East. A comprehensive settlement is not possible without the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and the withdrawal of Israel from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. Only then could arrangements be guaranteed for the security of all States in the region within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.In southern Africa  the hated system of apartheid perpetrates its vicious acts of violence and repression against the majority black people of South Africa. The racist regime continues to destabilize its independent African neighbours. Apartheid cannot be reformed. Only decisive action by the international community  not excluding the imposition of mandatory sanctions  can bring down the evil edifice of apartheid.In Namibia  after facing several obstacles  we ate able to welcome the commencement of steps this year for the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence. Sri Lanka looks forward very much to receiving independent Namibia as a full Member of the Organization in the very near future.Nearer home  in South-West Asia  we welcome the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan. We note with concern  however  that peace has not been completely restored to that country. The free exercise of the right to self-determination by all the Afghan people and the return  in conditions of safety and honour  of Afghan refugees are indispensable to any comprehensive political settlement of the problem. In South-East Asia  we believe that conflict and tension can be eased only on the basis of the withdrawal of foreign forces and the exercise of the right of the people of Cambodia freely to determine their destiny without outside pressure.The continued presence of foreign occupation forces in the Republic of Cyprus obstructs the achievement of a lasting solution to all aspects of the question. Sri Lanka strongly supports the independence  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Cyprus. We encourage the Secretary-General to continue his mission of good offices  and we appeal to all parties involved to co-operate with him in a constructive spirit.I have touched briefly on a number of issues which have been on the Assembly's agenda for several years. Despite the many obstacles which continue to hinder their solution  there is much that offers hope and promise.In a broad sense  the new co-operative relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has eased tensions  particularly in Europe. We non-aligned States have had the opportunity to assess these developments at the summit conference held in Yugoslavia. In the field of disarmament  the prospect of progress is more than illusory. The Treaty on the Elimination of Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - is an important step in a long journey which has just begun. The threat of nuclear annihilation has not been eliminated  and we are following with interest the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on reductions in their strategic offensive nuclear arsenals. It is essential that the process be widened to include other nuclear-weapon States as well and eventually lead to the complete elimination of these weapons of extinction. An immediate and comprehensive ban on nuclear testing meanwhile remains one of the highest priorities of disarmament  and Sri Lanka is one of over 40 States which have taken action to convene an amendment conference to convert the 1963 partial test-banTreaty into one that is comprehensive. That would also help to enhance the credibility of the nuclear-non-proliferation regime on the eve of the Review Conference.As a member of the Conference on Disarmament  Sri Lanka firmly maintains that this single multilateral negotiating forum should not delay the commencement of substantive negotiations on all issues relating to nuclear disarmament and on the prevention of the arms race in outer space. We urge the Conference to conclude its work on a comprehensive and global convention banning the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction. Sri Lanka welcomes the initiative announced by the United States President  Mr. George Bush  to destroy all chemical weapons within a decade. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has the same desire to be rid of these barbaric weapons. That augurs well for all humanity.Finally  let me briefly refer to the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. The General Assembly has by a consensus decision called for the convening of the conference on the Indian Ocean in 1990 in Colombo  Sri Lanka  to fulfil the objectives contained in the Declaration and considered by the littoral and hinterland States at their meeting in 1979. The Heads of State of the non-aligned countries at their ninth summit conference  in Belgrade  called for the full and active participation in the Conference by the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Ocean  whose co-operation is essential for the success of the Conference. We urge all States concerned to finalize preparatory work for the Conference to ensure its convening in 1990.The agenda for this forty-fourth session covers a wide and varied diversity of items  including those of an economic  political  cultural and humanitarian character. Yet there is an intrinsic relationship between most of these items which makes difficult their consideration in complete isolation. A recurrent theme in our debate has been that many of our concerns require co-ordinated  global approaches that transcend national frontiers. For example  the children of the world are the hope and the future of the world. The concept of a world summit for children  endorsed by a number of world leaders  including my President  calls for global commitment and universal support. The possibilities and options open to an individual State for unilateral action are being increasingly circumscribed. All this emphasizes human interdependence.Despite disparities in size and power  we are  all bound  therefore  to share a single planet and its resources. This requires that affairs among nations be so ordered as to ensure at least our very survival  not to speak of our development and progress. The cynical pursuit of myopic national interests through the inequitable deployment of political  military or economic muscle will negate our shared goals. Interdependence must therefore be a catalyst for co-operation on the principle of the sovereign equality of States on which our Organization is based."
"86",4203,"LSO",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the people and the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho  and on my own behalf  I have the pleasure and the honour to extend to you personally. Sir  and to the members of the Assembly  our fraternal greetings. In so doing  we take the opportunity to offer our warm congratulations upon your most befitting and deserving assumption of the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.We are in no doubt that the General Assembly will benefit enormously from your prowess and demonstrated diplomatic skills  your wisdom  and your experience  in the course of your duty to guide the deliberations of the General Assembly - a brilliant manifestation of the oneness of the wide world community of sovereign States bound together by the principles of freedom  equality  and mutual respect. You have distinguished yourself. Sir  not only by your dynamic representation of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  but also as a champion of the course of freedom and justice everywhere  more especially in the duties you discharged as Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid. Also  we cannot but pay a special tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Foreign Minister of the Argentine Republic  for the able and effective manner in which he conducted the proceedings of the forty-third session.As we meet in this forty-fourth year of the existence of the United Nations  we should once more feel duty-bound to express our gratitude to the founding fathers of the Organization for their vision in having left  for humanity  the legacy of the Organisation  which has become the guarantee for humanity own continued survival.This occasion therefore provides us with an opportunity to renew our solemn faith in the lofty Ideals and historic mission of the United Nations Charter. It is a lesson we have learned collectively that only a deep-rooted seize of commitment to the principles of the Charter will extricate our planet from the current global insecurity and mistrust and lead us all to a happier  common future.There is  increasingly  a notable realisation among nations that the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  whenever possible  is both an imperative and a pre-condition for mutual trust  confidence and security - in fact  for our very survival. It is a manifest reality of human history that true peace  not subservience  and justice  not domination  are the positive conditions for real progress and genuine development. To us smaller nations  it is  further  a guarantee against the hegemonic tendencies of the bigger and stronger nations  which have so often fall into the temptation of using their military and economic superiority to advance their designs not only for undue influence but  worse still  for domination. We should go through the remaining decade of the twentieth century strengthened in our resolve to make the next century a century of hope  peace and co-operation among all the nations of our planet.We are pleased to register our appreciation of the increased effectiveness of the United Nations and the ever-expanding role that it continues to play in the promotion of the peaceful settlement of disputes  sound co-operation among nations  and continuous adherence to  and observance of  the cardinal principles of the United Nations Charter.As we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century  the clarion call of the United Nations is for all countries to martial their collective strength in forging a common destiny for mankind  in which the worth and dignity of the human person shall take centre stage. For far too long  the world has failed to muster sufficient political will to embark on an effective strategy to reverse the ever-rising tide of inequalities among and within nations  of the alarming deterioration of our environment  and of debilitating confrontations  all of which are a threat to our common future and security. It is a sad reality of  and indeed a bad reflection on  the moral conscience of our age to see  in peace-time  conditions of extreme human suffering and deprivation which would generally be associated with the ravages of armed conflict. The economic hardships which have plagued some our countries still persist despite the general improvement in the performance of the world economy as shown in the 1989 World Economic Survey.While there are obvious signs of economic recovery in some of the developing countries  other countries are still experiencing a continuous decline in their per capita Incomes  thus making it necessary to call for a major review of the world economic order. The developing nations have always been concerned about commodity prices  about the imbalances caused by the outward flew of capital through debt payments and the demands of the developed economies  on one side  and caused by very low investments  in real terms  by developed nations in the developing countries  on the other. Therefore  economic recovery and rehabilitation in our countries are being seriously hampered by the hostile economic environment  characterized by massive external debt which has now readied crisis proportions  by the decline in commodity prices  by the deterioration in the terms of trade  and increasing protectionist tendencies in the developed countries.Official development assistance is not only stagnating at less than half of the internationally accepted target  but is  in real terms  declining. Monetary conditions have shown a tendency towards instability  with misaligned exchange rates. All these factors have resulted in a process of unfavourable transfer of resources from developing to developed countries  with disastrous economic consequences in the former. The external debt crisis  which has now reached serious political and economic dimensions  has emerged as one of the main obstacles to growth and development in our countries. We therefore call on the international community  particularly the creditor countries  to resolve this crisis in a spirit of shared responsibility. While calling for a substantial and timely reduction of the stock and services of the external debt  the developing countries would welcome a significant flow of new financial resources and real investments commensurate with their economic needs.However  the response of the international community to the debt issue  has  so far  been encouraging. Ã variety of remedial actions have been initiated; these include the World Bank's special programme of assistance  the International Monetary Fund's enhanced structural adjustment facility  and the fifth replenishment of the African Development Bank.At their ninth summit Conference in Belgrade this year  the Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries made concrete and wide-ranging proposals regarding the areas in which the international community could increase its co-operation towards combating the menace of external indebtedness. These proposals deserve our serious consideration because  in the interdependent world economy  the negative trends referred to will in the long run have adverse effects on all our countries  developed and developing alike.The African countries  on their part  have decided to adopt a regional approach to the debt issue through the holding of an international conference on African debt. It is hoped the outcome of this conference will be a decisive strategy to resolve this problem and bring much needed relief to our burdened economies.In a resolute determination to implement the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development for the period 1986 to 1990 designed to pull our countries out of the economic slump  our Governments have spared no effort and wasted no time in vigorously embarking on structural adjustment programmes  blended with initiatives and alternatives arising out of peculiar country situations  which have been suggested by our partners in development and supported by the International Monetary Fund and the World Sank  as one decisive step towards economic  rehabilitation. But let us be quite frank with each other: these adjustment programmes will succeed only if our partners in development are aware and realize that they  too  have to make commensurate adjustment.While declaring our belief in structural adjustment measures  we are  however  of the opinion that to serve best the needs of our countries these externally conceived prescriptions should have been tailored in full cognisance of the peculiar circumstances prevailing in each of our different countries* Only in this way could the measures effectively cover the whole spectrum of development concerns in our countries.Referring to these orthodox structural adjustment programmes now recommended for Africa and the developing world  the Caracas Ministerial Declaration stimulates that they should be reviewed and replaced by other more viable alternatives which would take into account the social  political and economic conditions and realities of Africa. During the mid-term review and appraisal of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  the General Assembly at its forty-third session  bearing in mind that African Governments have the central role to play in the design and implementation of their adjustment programmes  stipulated  inter alia  that these Governments should increase their efforts in the search for a viable conceptual and practical framework for economic structural adjustment programmes  in keeping with the long-term development objectives and strategies at the national  sub-regional and regional levels.The Economic Commission for Africa acted very swiftly to embark on a search for an African alternative framework to structural adjustment programmes. The alternative framework that has new been worked out and generally accepted by African government ensures that  while adjustment programmes will be aimed at the fundamental transformation of the African economics  they will take due account of the specific economic situations and national development priorities of each country. Most of all  these programmes will be designed so as to incorporate a human dimension  with no adverse effect on vulnerable groups of our societies.The African countries are really determined to take charge of their own development destinies. All they need is the necessary and appropriate back-up and support from their international partners in development.The question of the environment and the need to preserve the global ecological balance has become one of the major-issues before the world community. The problem of the environment is a complex one  with political  economic  social and cultural ramifications.In the developing countries  the environment crisis is acute. In fact  foe close to a billion people living in these countries it is a matter of survival; and yet they have so far had the least say  given their economic situation. Effective protection of the environment cannot  realistically  take place in situations of human deprivation because the already limited financial and other resources can only be channelled towards economic and social development.There is  therefore  a need for international co-operation in order to co-ordinate all our efforts and arrest the degradation of our common heritage: the environment. Success in this urgent international effort can be realized only if the developed industrialized countries extend all the necessary assistance - financial and technical - to the developing countries  as these countries still lack the necessary means.At the same time  we urge that these environmental problems  urgent and serious as they are  not be compounded by the imposition of unfavourable conditions in the lending and other economic co-operation policies of the developed countries. Environmental problems  it must be acknowledged  are the result not only of neglect and lack of knew-hew in the developing countries but also of careless development and pollution generated by the industrialized countries. These countries  therefore  have a primary responsibility towards solving the problem.Dumping of hazardous wastes originating from the industrialized countries in our so-called third world countries is another issue of grave concern and an outrage which has been deplored by virtually all Governments in the developing world. It is disturbing that the industrialized com tries with the technology and other means for properly treating and disposing of wastes should deem it convenient to transport these substances end wastes to the developing countries  where the immediate and long-term consequences to the environment and human health can be immeasurable. It is a gross injustice to impose health and other hazards on the inhabitants of our countries simply because as yet they do not have laws controlling and prohibiting disposal of such harmful wastes. It is very immoral for the industrialized countries to trample on the rights of the poor peoples in the developing countries simply because  in the latter  public resentment is not as vocal as it invariably is in the former. We call on the industrialized countries to respect the right of the developing countries to a clean and healthy environment.The United Nations is the most appropriate forum for solving these environment problems effectively. The adoption by the General Assembly at its forty-third session of the resolution entitled  Responsibility of States for the protection of the environment  prevention of the illegal international traffic in  and the dumping and resulting accumulation of toxic and dangerous products and wastes affecting the developing countries in particular  was an acknowledgement by this world body of its role of combating the serious problems posed by environmental degradation and protecting the disadvantaged inhabitants of our common planet.The year -1992 will mark the twentieth anniversary c f the Stockholm Conference on the environment. It is our fervent hope that the occasion will be marked appropriately by renewed international commitment to make this world a safe place for all.We meet today against the background of an emerging global atmosphere of a serious search for peace  disarmament and elimination of international tensions - a departure from the attitudes of rivalry and East-West confrontations that have characterized international relationships during the past 40 years. The bipolar doctrines of the twentieth century are being replaced by restraint  mutual accommodation and consolidation of efforts towards universal peace and security for all nations  large and small.The rapprochement reached by the two super-Powers and  in particular  the progress achieved in disarmament negotiations  and the influences they have brought to bear in the resolution of regional conflicts have greatly improved the international political climate. Much as we welcome the breeze of global relaxation of tensions  we remain uneasy and sceptical about the ever-present threat to the security and survival of small nations. We would wish to see increased United Nations interest in the legitimate concerns of small States and the ultimate fruition of an international regime backed up by appropriate instruments guaranteeing the rights and sovereignty of these States.The disadvantaged situation of small States and their characteristic constraints  compounded  as in the case of Lesol 10  by unfavourable geographic location and possible isolation by a powerful neighbour  merit the special attention of this body. We call upon the international community to rally to our support and assistance in our endeavours to build viable  self-reliant and sustainable national economies. It is in this Assembly that the independence and sovereignty of small States can be guaranteed; it is here that they are able to communicate with the bigger nations on the basis of equality  freedom and mutual respect.In southern Africa there is a growing prospect for improvement in the general political situation from the crucible of a long and bloody struggle for self-determination. The light of freedom is at long last dawning upon Namibia. Notwithstanding the tragic events of last April  when the international community  through the United Nations  set in motion the independence plan for Namibia  there is fortunately a renewed recognition that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is the only road to Namibia's independence.It is therefore absolutely necessary that there be full compliance with the previsions of the settlement plan and that all the relevant parties honour their commitments so that the people of Namibia may be able to determine their future without hindrance.Our optimism for the success of the United Nations independence plan for Namibia has been fortified by the selfless devotion to duty and the professional integrity and impartiality with which the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) is conducting itself in pursuit of our common endeavour to bring Namibia to independence through free and fair elections in the not-too-distant future.It is our firm belief that  because of the sheer size of the territory of Namibia and the complexity of the situation on the ground  the originally conceived UNTAG force level of 7 500 remains a viable and realistic proposition. Â·The recent incidents of violence in Namibia have demonstrated clearly that the task of maintaining peace and impartiality during the transition period  particularly during the election itself  will indeed be a difficult one. It is therefore a matter of great importance that the resources put at the disposal of the Secretary-General for the implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia be commensurate with the enormity of the task as well as with the Importance attached by the international community to the independence of that country  we accordingly appeal to the Security Council to reach unanimity on this issue to ensure the strengthening and necessary increase of the UNTAG force. We extend our hearty congratulations to all the countries whose initiatives have directly or indirectly facilitated the launching of the settlement process. We cannot but include in this tribute the Secretary-General  whose unflagging determination to see Namibia attain independence under the United Nations plan has been a source of strength and sustenance to the settlement plan.In accordance with our long-standing policy of principled opposition to apartheid  the Kingdom of Lesotho continues to call for the urgent and total dismantling of that system and the creation of a just and democratic South Africa  with equal rights and opportunities for all its citizens. Let this Assembly take note that the people of the Kingdom of Lesotho and their Government feel apartheid cannot be reformed; it must be dismantled and uprooted. We owe it to our founding fathers to continue to say that there should be no discrimination between our respective citizens we owe it  as a Government  to all the black peoples  Basotho included  to join in this common cause with everything we have at our disposal.Encouraging developments in South Africa are taking place: the growth of the internal mass democratic movement and the growing consensus  even among the white population  that apartheid is both irrelevant and detrimental to the general economy and to the development of both South Africa and southern Africa are indicators that ought to receive due support and attention. To give credence to these hopeful signs it is our fervent hope that the South African authorities will take decisive and urgent steps to restore to all South Africans their inalienable right to full participation in the social and political life of their country. In this regard the release of political prisoners and detainees and the lifting of the ban on political organizations  as well as allowing the return of exiles to their homeland  remain key prerequisites.For far too long South African authorities have failed to heed legitimate calls for democratic change in that country. Among other things  this failure has brought in its wake not only severe hardships and irreparable loss of life but the imposition by the international community of punitive sanctions.We wish to urge  however  that the rationale and moral justification for economic and other sanctions against South Africa notwithstanding  due cognisance be given to Lesotho's unique geopolitical position and the consequential adverse effects of those measures on our economy.In this context we cannot but plead for a sympathetic appreciation by the community of nations of the peculiarities of our position and the urgent need to cushion us and all other southern African neighbours against the stark hardships of the intensified campaign for sanctions. Lesotho subscribes fully to  and supports  all initiatives for a negotiated solution of the South African question  and pledges itself to continue to play a constructive role in that direction. Lesotho is not concerned only about the present situation  but also about the future. We wish to see a different South Africa one that will respect and honour the principles of good-neighbourliness of healthy reciprocity in the treatment of all of our citizens  regardless of race or colour  we wish to see emerge a new South Africa that will respect our territorial sovereignty and national integrity.In addressing the question of apartheid  we are reminded the continuing plight of refugees and displaced persons in southern Africa. Our commitment to the conventions of this body remains unshaken. It is our sincere hope that the international community will continue to seek ways and means of giving practical effect to its undertaking on the plight of refugees and displaced persons in southern Africa  particularly on the issues of assistance to all the countries of southern Africa.The implementation of the United Nations settlement plan for Namibia has made a new vista for the return of peace to Angola. We applaud the signature of New York Agreements which upheld the principle of non-interference in the external affairs of Angola. We equally welcome the Luanda and Gbadolite accords  constitute a practical framework for reconciliation between the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and UNITA. We are hopeful that the difficulties that have emerged since those agreements were signed can be overcome with the exercise of political will  determination  flexibility and accommodation on both sides. The same holds true for the People's Republic of Mozambique which merits the full support of this body for its current efforts to bring normalcy to that country through peace and reconciliation. We recognize the continued quest by the people of Western Sahara for self-determination and independence. The Kingdom of Lesotho supports and encourages all peace moves conducted by the parties to the dispute aimed at the realization of this goal. We co men d the efforts of the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations for their catalytic role towards accomplishment of the settlement plan.Never before in contemporary history has peaceful settlement of disputes acquired such importance in international relations. It is indeed a matter of serious concern that the situation in the Middle East continues towards these progressive trends.Peace in that region will come about only when the parties to the conflict have mastered sufficient political will and flexibility to face up to the reality of the difficult decisions that will have to be made in the interest of peace and stability. Experience dram from the Camp David Accords has demonstrably proved that peace in the Middle East is well within the realm of possibility.We reaffirm our support for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East to look into all aspects of the problem of that region with the participation of all the parties concerned; including the Palestine Liberation Organization. It is our firm belief that such a conference would make a major contribution to reconciling the people of the Middle East through a peaceful formula that would aim to achieve mutual recognition of each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity  as well as to uphold the principle of right to self-determination.The Palestinian question  ever so central to the Middle East problem  has  with the advent of the intifadah and the declaration of the new State of Palestine  assumed a new sense of urgency. Like all the peoples of the Middle East  the Palestinians have a right to independence and a sovereign homeland. It is thus incumbent open the United Nations to see to it that no effort is spared to ensure that the Palestinian nation takes up its rightful place as a full member of the community of nations.Another dimension of the Middle East problem we are constantly reminded of is the tragic situation arising from the fratricidal war in Lebanon. It should by now be very clear to the warring parties that there can be no military solution to that conflict in which we are daily witnessing the loss of precious life and the destruction of property. We support the peace initiatives currently in progress to bring a halt to the hostilities there and to work towards a negotiated settlement and true reconciliation. In this regard  we wish particularly to applaud the efforts of the Arab League and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.We cannot but express our great satisfaction at the completion of the withdrawal of the Soviet military forces from Afghanistan on 15 February this year  pursuant to the Agreements reached in Geneva in April 1988. By agreeing to pull its forces out of Afghanistan  the Soviet Union has demonstrated its political will and determination to contribute positively to a comprehensive solution to the Afghan problem and to promote conditions of peace and security in the region. Is it not  however  a travesty that  even in the wake of the withdrawal of the Soviet military forces from Afghanistan  the coin try continues to bleed from a fratricidal war? It is our considered view that the cause of restoring peace to Afghanistan can best be advanced  not by a continued inflow of at armaments from outside  which help only to fuel the conflict  but by intra-Afghan dialogue leading to the cessation of hoe till ties and negotiation of a common future of hope and fraternity for the people of Afghanistan.The Kingdom of Lesotho continues to add its' support to the regional and international initiatives aimed at achieving a durable and peaceful solution to the Kampuchean question  particularly the first and second Jakarta Informal Meetings held during July 1988 and February 1989 respectively  and the subsequent meetings between the parties concerned.We equally welcome the decision of the non-aligned countries to establish a committee on Kampuchea consisting of 13 countries and  not least the commendable efforts of the 19 countries  including the five permanent members of the Security Council  which assembled in Paris at the end of July this year with the purpose of finding a solution to the problem of Kampuchea. The stalling of the Paris negotiations  while regrettable  should strengthen the resolve of the international community to intensify efforts towards the ultimate achievement of a peaceful settlement. We view those efforts and initiatives as complementary and mutually reinforcing  and as significant contributions towards a comprehensive solution to that problem.The undertaking by the Vietnamese Government it in April 1989 unconditionally to withdraw the rest of its troops from Kampuchea by the end of September this year  should  if buttressed by internationally acceptable verification measures  remove one of the major obstacles and offer enhanced prospects for the realization of peace in that country.It is the moral responsibility of the international community  not only to stop the war  but to give support and sustenance to the achievement of a satisfactory internal political settlement that will ensure that Kampuchea fully recovers from the wounds of the Indo-China war  the genocidal practices of the recent past and the untenable circumstances of foreign occupation.The international community must not relax its efforts for the preparation of peace  reconciliation and dialogue in the Korean peninsula. In calling for the speedy reunification of Korea  we urge the two sides to do everything possible to promote mutual trust and adopt confidence-buildingThe prerequisite for the attainment of peaceful reunification will always be the easing of tension and military confrontation and this demands political will and determination on both sides. We are indeed heartened by the efforts being made by the Korean people to achieve the reunification of their fatherland through dialogue and mutual consultation.The people of Korea should not  however  in the interim  be denied their right to full membership of the United Nations  even as a divided nation. The Government of Lesotho  guided by the principle of universality of the United Nations  would readily support assumption of United Nations membership by both Koreas  should they choose to do so.Over 25 years ago  this Organization established the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNPICYP) in order to create the best conditions under which peaceful solutions to the Cyprus problem could be achieved. We regret that in all that time it has not been possible to achieve a negotiated settlement of all aspects of the Cyprus problem. The Kingdom of Lesotho continues to welcome  and to reaffirm its support for  the efforts of the Secretary-General in pursuing the mission of good offices entrusted to him by the Security Council. We particularly welcome the direct talks launched  in August 1988 under the auspices of the Secretary-General  between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community. It is our sincere hope that both parties will co-operate fully with the Secretary-General in his latest endeavour  by showing the necessary flexibility and goodwill.We urge the two parties to consider taking further steps  in co-operation with United Nations personnel  aimed at reducing the recurrence of violent incidents and at creating an atmosphere conducive to peaceful and result-oriented dialogue. Lesotho supports the proposals for the demilitarisation of Cyprus and for the convening of an international conference  under the auspices of the United Nations  on the international aspects of the Cyprus problem. we are convinced that the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cyprus remains an essential basis for an early and just solution to the problem and for the restoration of the country's unity  sovereignty and territorial integrity.We witness the important developments taking place in Central America  which are characterized by processes of democratization  political harmonization and a genuine search for peace  aimed at strengthening security and development in that region. The Kingdom of Lesotho is convinced that strict respect for the self-determination of peoples  non-interference in the internal affairs of States  and cessation of all pressures  threats and hostile acts against sovereign States constitute the essential basis for peace  development and democracy in Central America. The peace agreement recently concluded by the Central American Presidents in Honduras constitute a major contribution to the attainment of durable and lasting peace in the region. We appeal to all Governments to respect the will of the Central American people to implement the joint plan for the restoration off peace in Central America and to desist from any action that might jeopardize the completion of this process.So far as the Falkland and Malians question is concerned  it is our fervent hope that Argentina and the United Kingdom will eventually arrive at a mutually acceptable solution on the basis of the General Assembly resolution on that Territory. They should be accorded ail support in their current endeavours and initiatives in the search for a peaceful solution to their differences.As the world steers off the paths of confrontation and extricates itself from regional conflicts  it behoves all of us to consolidate and accelerate the process of the relaxation of international tension by lending fresh impetus to the peace efforts being made to turn swords into ploughshares. Despite the positive developments we have witnessed in the field of disarmament in recent years  the world is still threatened by the massive nuclear arsenals that are still in place on our planet and are being further refined  increased and even modernized.The Kingdom of Lesotho is heartened by the progress achieved in the negotiations between the major Powers of the East and the Hest that resulted in the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and in agreement  in principle  to reduce their strategic arsenals by 50 per cent  it is our hope that these agreements are only a precursor of the eventual total elimination of these weapons and that all other States possessing nuclear weapons will also be involved in these positive efforts. We are under no illusion that negotiations leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons will be easy.The recent agreement between the United States of America and the Soviet Union to resume negotiations on a nuclear-tee t ban and the initiative taken by Indonesia  Peru  Sri Lanka  Mexico and Yugoslavia in calling for an amendment conference of States parties to the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty  with a view to transforming that Treaty into a comprehensive test-ban treaty  constitute important contributions to the advancement of international security and the process of disarmament. It is our hope that the Conference on Disarmament will complete these efforts by embarking urgently upon negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear-test ban treaty that is binding on all States  in order to de-escalate the nuclear-arms race and reduce the threat of nuclear war.Lesotho continues to register its support for the individual and regional initiatives that envisage the establishment of nuclear-free zones in various parts of the globe  and views these as a valid treaty for the observation of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the observation of international peace and security.	-Â·Mankind is eager to forgo the weapons of mass destruction  whether these be nuclear  chemical or biological. The overwhelming attendance at  and the successful conclusion of  the international Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  bringing together  in Paris in January this year  the States parties to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and other interested parties  was testimony to humanity's rejection of these arsenals of death and mass destruction. We exert ourselves to create a world free from nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  we should not  however  overlook the need to adopt measures for the limitation and gradual reduction of conventional weapons  within the framework of progress towards general and complete disarmament.The international community should equally remain vigilant against the projection of the arms race into outer space. Outer space is the common heritage of mankind and should be used only for peaceful purposes and for the benefit of mankind. Scientific and technological development should be directed towards the benefit  and not the detriment  of mankind.We have observed huge amounts of financial and other resources being devoted to the production and development of the means of war  while a large part of humanity continues to live in a world riddled with poverty  hunger  ignorance and disease. This misallocation of resources for the production and procurement of deadly weapons is not in the best interests of humanity. We see great value in the action programs adopted by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which calls for the release  through disarmament measures  of resources for developing countries.As we witness the world transformation  leaving the spectre of the cold war to history  let us resolutely step up our joint efforts for the very survival of current and succeeding generations. Let us rekindle the hopes and aspirations of mankind by inculcating the spirit of interdependence and common destinies. These noble aims can be achieved only when there is respect for the sovereign right of every nation  small or large  to determine and decide freely its own social and political system. Let us truly live up to the lofty ideals of the United Nations. It would be remiss on my part if I ended this address without paying a special tribute to the indefatigable Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. As is typical of him  he continues to discharge his calling with honour and dignity. His untiring  noble efforts in the pursuit of peace  sometimes against heavy and demanding challenges  to find solutions that would eliminate the conflicts in our once-turbulent world  dictate to all peoples of conscience that they accord him the essential elements of cooperation and support."
"87",4273,"LUX",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government of Luxembourg I wish to convey to our President our warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the Assembly. Along with his wealth of diplomatic experience  particularly as Foreign Minister of one of the most important countries in Africa  he has sound qualities enabling him to direct our work wisely and effectively.On Tuesday Mr. Roland Dumas  Foreign Minister of France  expressed the views of the 12 States Members of the European Community about the main subjects on the current international scene. Since his statement reflected our common concerns  I shall confine myself to giving just a few additional details.Over the past 12 months we have noted a continued general improvement in international relations. A favourable climate is developing between the Soviet Union and the United States  between East and West and between North and South. Big steps forward have been made in the solution of a number of regional conflicts  making a reality of the favourable prospects noted last year. More and more the military option and military pressure are giving way to negotiation and co-operation  on the basis of the principles of the Charter  as a means of solving international problems.It is  first  in Europe that we see these favourable developments  accompanied by profound changes. The European Community is pursuing with determination its process of unification. The creation of a single market adds an important dimension to that movement. The Community is open  and will remain open  to all the countries of the world  and  true to its purpose  it is bringing about new opportunities for growth and co-operation for all.In the light of that process  we welcome the emergence of open and truly democratic societies in Central and Eastern Europe. The first free elections in Poland  which have just taken place  as well as the programme of the new Government resulting from those elections  offers prospects - undoubtedly difficult to make a reality  but extremely encouraging - of the building of a Poland that is master of its own fate and faithful to the identity and the most cherished aspirations of its people.Similar developments are occurring in Hungary  on the basis of conditions that are peculiar to that country. There  too. the way is now open for a multi-party system.In the Soviet Union the process of democratisation is making headway. In particular  it has been cemented by the creation of new institutions - the People's Congress and the Supreme Soviet - following elections in which a plurality of candidates was assured.We hope that the course thus embarked upon will be followed by the other countries of Eastern Europe  so that the end of the twentieth century will be marked by the triumph of democracy  human rights and fundamental freedoms.Significant economic restructuring is accompanying those political changes. With them  there will be a progressive elimination of bureaucratic  centralized planning  which will give way to a market economy  one with social responsibility  but based on autonomy of decision-making for those involved in economic life. The vitality of more productive economies will be such as to make it possible to overcome the grave economic problems faced by the countries concerned.The political and economic reforms will inevitably lead to new forms of co-operation between the European countries. The old psychological and physical barriers have been torn down. Ideas  information and people are circulating freely. The European peoples are rediscovering each other and growing closer. Sound institutions  such as the Council of Europe and even the process of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe  are the foundations on which the desire of Europeans to live together freely and in complete trust can grow.In that connection  my Government attaches great importance to President Gorbachev's recent assurances that every country is free to choose its own path and that therefore no country can arrogate to itself the right to resort to force to impose its will on others. As that assurance is accompanied by the fact that the Soviet Union is being turned into a State where the rule of law is paramount  it takes on a particular significance.The very encouraging prospects now seen in the negotiations on conventional weapons in Europe  which have been opened in Vienna  are a persuasive example of the new climate of convergence between the two parts of Europe. By lowering the levels of various categories of weapons  by pledging themselves to increased transparency and predictability in military questions and by defining new confidence-building measures based on strictly defensive strategies  the 23 countries concerned - indeed  the 35 associated with the negotiations - are putting an end to 45 years of suspicion and hostility.We welcome the resumption of negotiations on the reduction of strategic nuclear weapons. As regards the negotiations on chemical weapons  President Bush's recent invitation  which the Soviet side has already accepted in principle  will make possible a real advance in this very complex area. We should take advantage of the momentum thus created and speedily conclude a balanced and verifiable agreement.In Afghanistan  an important part of the Geneva Accords has been implemented with the withdrawal of Soviet troops  in accordance with the timetable laid down  thus putting an end to a foreign occupation which had lasted for more than 10 years. However  the situation continues to he very worrying  because of the deadly struggles still going on between different Afghan factions.In Cambodia we await the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops by the end of this month. Here  as elsewhere  it seems to me desirable and even inevitable that our Organization should play a paramount role in the search for a peaceful solution and in its implementation.It is regrettable that the Korean people is still not occupying a seat here as a Member  in violation of our Organization's principle of universality.There are some encouraging signs with regard to the African continent.A historic process is culminating in Namibia  thanks to the efforts of the United Nations. We welcome the fact that after the signing of the two agreements last December the implementation of the process laid down in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has finally got under way. I have no doubt that that operation is beneficial for our Organization; it should give us inspiration for the future.The gradual withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola also gives grounds for satisfaction. It is to be hoped that national reconciliation will now follow. A similar reconciliation effort in Mozambique also deserves our support. The same is true of the negotiations that the Government of Sudan is to undertake with the opposition in the south  as well as the negotiations that the Government of Ethiopia is conducting  on President Carter's initiative  with the representatives of the Eritrean people.The painful problem of apartheid in South Africa still remains. The elections held at the beginning of this month showed that even among the white population large sections are in favour of change. It is up to the new leaders to carry out their mandate for reform  by immediately freeing Nelson Mandela and the other leaders of the anti-apartheid movements  by ending the state of emergency and by legalizing the opposition parties and movements - in short  by putting an end to the regime of brutal repression  which still exists  and which caused so much violence in the recent elections.In Central America  the prospects of agreement have never been so good. After the conclusion of the Esquipulas II and Costa del Sol agreements and the recent meeting at Tela on the 7 August  the peace-making mechanism can now start up.The promise of free elections in Nicaragua  next February  is also an extremely important element in this regard. In El Salvador  the dialogue between the opposing parties also seems to be under way.Thus all the countries in this region have given effect to their intent to move towards democratic pluralism  respect for human rights  the promotion of social justice and resolution of the serious social economic problems that have been aggravated by 10 years of a pitiless warfare.In contrast with Africa and Central America  in the Middle East we are witnessing a situation that is constantly deteriorating. The road towards a negotiated solution continues to be blocked. The uprising in the occupied territories is spreading. Day after day there is an increase in the confrontation together with an increase in the number of the dead and wounded and in the suffering of the general population. In the light of the decisions taken by the Security Council  the occupying forces continue to resort to repressive measures which are  inter alia  at variance with the Geneva Convention.This is particularly regrettable since important changes have taken place in the last year; the decision taken by the Palestinian National Council recognizing the existence of Israel  to give up terrorism and to conduct negotiations on the basis of resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the Security Council. The decision of the United States to recognize the existence of the Palestine Liberation Organization and to initiate a dialogue with its representatives is  likewise  an important step in the right direction.Organizing elections in the occupied territories  including East Jerusalem  may prove a useful step  provided that it is seen to be part and parcel of an overall process and to the extent that the elections are held under acceptable international safeguards for both parties. The Palestinians have the same rights to existence and to selfâdetermination as those which were demanded and won after so much suffering and tragic sacrifice by Israel.We cannot be resigned to tragedy which is tightening the stranglehold on Lebanon day by day. The sufferings caused to the Lebanese population are of concern to us all. The coming about of the cease-fire and the resumption of dialogue between the various Lebanese communities  which are all equal in rights and obligations  as well as the withdrawal of all foreign forces  are two prerequisites to cessation of the civil war.Between Iran and Iraq  the cease-fire has undoubtedly been respected. Nevertheless  it is disappointing to note that the negotiations being conducted by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative with the two parties have not yet yielded the slightest result. Nevertheless  there can be no valid alternative to seeking for a global solution  based on resolution 598 (1987) of the Security Council.On the question of Cyprus  the SecretaryâGeneral has initiated a new series of intra-community negotiations and submitted to both parties proposals that are intended to be part of a settlement plan. My Government unreservedly supports the action of the Secretary-General and his representative with a view to the continuance and intensification of the negotiations.The same is true of the conciliation which is being pursued by our Secretary-General with regard to the questions of Western Sahara and East Timor  in order to arrive at a solution based on respect for the aspirations of the peoples of those regions. The intensified search for agreements in various regional problems has led to a systematic resort to  and multiplication of  peace-keeping operations.Congratulations are due to those United Nations officers who are able to assist in defining  deploying and conducting these operations with admirable skill and effectiveness. These operations are of inestimable service to the cause of peace. They guarantee to the United Nations an unprecedented authority and prestige. Nevertheless  they should not let us overlook the fact that they are only a temporary solution  intended to facilitate the implementation of a final settlement of those conflicts. Their smooth functioning also requires that each State faithfully fulfil its financial obligations  past or present. Regardless of its financial situation  my Government will study practical ways and means of contributing directly to the peace-keeping forces.You may well imagine the feeling aroused by the craven execution of Lieutenant-Colonel Higgins in Lebanon  who was kidnapped in the course of his duties. This criminal act illustrates the dangers to which members of these international forces are vulnerable when exercising their mission.The Government of Luxembourg  which is the outcome of recent elections  continues to attach extreme importance to respect for human rights.More than 40 years ago  our General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. At a time when we are celebrating the bicentennial of the French Revolution  it is extremely regrettable to note that more than 60 States  including some of the larger ones  have still not ratified the International Covenants on Human Rights. Furthermore  in many States where the provisions of these instruments are already in force  there is no adequate legal protection or any sufficiently effective sanction machinery to ensure that they are respected.For the Government of Luxembourg  the educational efforts needed to inform and to awaken the conscience of people and to promote a spirit of tolerance and justice  should be pursued and reinforced. The same is true of the disinterested action of non-governmental organizations that unreservedly commit themselves to promoting the cause of human rights  even going so far as to risk the lives of their members.In the light of the considerable emotion which in recent years we have been accustomed to feel about certain countries that have little respect for human rights  I should like to add my voice to that of the international community  and call upon the leaders of those countries to put an end to repressive acts and to allow a return to a policy of openness and reform in keeping with the course of history.Over and above the conflicts and the attacks on individuals  problems connected with the protection of the environment have become subjects of priority concern for universal public opinion: the statements which we have been listening to throughout this week provide clear evidence of this awareness. More and more human beings are affected by the damage caused to ecological balances. The destruction of forests is accelerating  the desert is spreading. The erosion of the soil is threatening agricultural production and the existence of millions of human beings. The pollution of the seas and oceans  and the proliferation of toxic wastes is daily leading to new tragedies. The slow destruction of the ozone layer exposes us to ultraviolet radiation with incalculable consequences.We are therefore firmly embarked on a course which is designed to prevent further deterioration of the environment. Initiatives successfully taken in recent months  particularly by Margaret Thatcher  Ruud Lubbers and Michel Rocard  as well as the Arche summit which met in Paris last July  have provided us with guidelines which should lead to urgent action. It is up to the international community at present  and therefore to our Organization  to define these priorities Pending the holding of an international conference on the environment  which has been planned for 1992. My Government agrees entirely that there is a need to draw up a model convention to define the problem and to lay down the guidelines for international action through concrete measures.  The destruction of tropical forests by burning  which  in its turn  produces carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  should be halted. The rights of indigenous peoples  particularly along the Amazon  who want to preserve their natural environment should be respected.A universal policy of protection and maintenance of forests should be launched. We shall succeed in this only if the courageous campaigns conducted by a number of movements working for the protection of the environment create a collective awareness of the situation.It seems to me that this is a very favourable moment to lay the foundation for lasting growth based on a synthesis between the ecological dimension and man's economic activities  it is primarily up to the industrialized countries  which are mainly responsible for the problem  to meet this challenge  of concern to all mankind. The Organization should create structures that are sufficiently sound  flexible and effective to enable action to be taken when it is required.Simultaneously  increased attention should be paid to the rapid growth of the world population  which is increasing at the rate of 1 billion every 10 years. This growth rate should be a cause of concern to us in the light of development possibilities and of the constraints that it will place upon the environment. In fact  the economic and social situation in a large number of developing countries remains disquieting. For millions of their inhabitants the 1980s have been a lost decade. This is particularly true of the countries of Latin America and of sub-Saharan Africa  where there has been stagnation and decline. Poverty  hungerand deprivation are killing 40 000 children every day. That is a shameful situation  which no one can shrug off.The simple struggle for survival has led large numbers of people in these countries to over-exploit nature. The pressure from debt-servicing  which accounts for  on average  30 per cent of their exports  has speeded up the excessive exploitation of their natural resources. In other words  short-term economic demands have prompted many Governments not to give ecological problems high priority. Therefore  it is hardly surprising that violence is increasing - indeed  taking on alarming dimensions. In the light of the situation to which they have been doomed  a number of young people are becoming drug addicts  prostitutes and delinquents and are indulging in new forms of criminality. The food riots that have taken place in some developing countries indicate clearly that young people are the victims of the upheavals that poverty has forced upon them. The number of refugees fleeing the warfare  persecution and terrorism  as well as unemployment and underdevelopment  increased from 5 million in 1978 to 14 million currently.The scope of these problems means that we must redouble our efforts. In particular  the 1990 special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation will provide us with an opportunity to redefine the principles and guidelines for building a world that is fairer and more human. It seems that in order to remedy this situation  and to ensure lasting growth  a substantial reduction in debt and in the cost of debt-servicing would be an important initial step. Following the agreements concluded with Mexico and the Philippines  the Brady Plan could be applied on a broader scale  taking into account the specific features of each situation. In the case of world trade  if the Uruguay Round is successful - as we unreservedly hope that it will be - it is likely that it will create favourable conditions for an increase in exports from the developing countries.Another evil  which is equally global and equally a threat  is the illicit trafficking in drugs. I urge a resolute strengthening of international co-operation  starting with the swift ratification  by all countries  of the Vienna Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and psychotropic Substances  which I have just signed on behalf of Luxembourg. It should be clear that Luxembourg  which is already participating in the working group that emerged from the summit meeting at the Arche de la Defence  will spare no effort in this field. I take this opportunity to welcome the very courageous and determined action that has been taken by the President of Colombia  Mr. Virgilio Barco - action that the Government of Luxembourg supports unreservedly.Before concluding  I should like to pay a just tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. His activity at the head of the Organization  his tireless efforts at mediation and conciliation have revealed his great talent as an organizer and a negotiator. His patient and far-sighted commitment to peace has made a substantial contribution to strengthening the role and importance of the United Nations in international affairs in recent years.My country has just celebrated the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its independence. I should like to thank the Secretary-General for having graced with his attendance the public events that took place last April in the presence of seven prime ministers and leaders of the main international organizations to which Luxembourg belongs. This celebration enabled us to relive the progress of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg through the vicissitudes of history. While noting that  in 1989  the future development of our country is surrounded by more favourable conditions than in the past  we must recognize that the life of small States in particular depends more and more on international organizations. Dealing precisely with the role of small States  the Secretary-General said on 18 April in Luxembourg;""They do not need to think about the danger or cost of endless wars to realize the absurdity of all armed aggression. Being more aware of their vulnerability  small States  or at least those of them that behave rationally  are naturally peaceful and respectful of the law. They also feel more keenly than others the need for international co-operation  which is the purpose of our Organization. Like war  isolation for them would spell suicide. Living by international trade  they are aware of the dangers of protectionism  as well as the soundness of the liberalization of trade and the usefulness of being integrated in broad economic spaces where conflicts are no longer conceivable and where everyone can profit from overall prosperity. Also  they can gauge the importance of regional political co-operation and the international co-operation which it engenders. Luxembourg  therefore plays an even greater role in the United Nations because it is an active member of the European Community  Firm supporters of the Organization  small countries play a particularly useful part in it since they have experience in conciliation and because their interests generally coincide with the general interest."" After that lengthy quotation  I have nothing to add.For what the Secretary-General has done at the head of the Organization  and for his presence in our country and the words he spoke there  I want simply  from the bottom of my heart  to express our complete gratitude."
"88",4346,"MAR",44,1989,"ï»¿ At the outset. Sit  let me  on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco  extend to you most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the Assembly. I am convinced that your experience and the many different responsible posts you have held represent the best possible guarantee for the successful completion of our work. Through your election the Assembly has paid a special tribute-to Nigeria  a brother country with which Morocco maintains very friendly ties.I should also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor for the wisdom with which he guided the work of the forty-third session. Let me also take this opportunity to express to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of our Organization  our sincere thanks for the efforts he has made towards reducing tensions and strengthening peace and security throughout the world. The current situation across the globe calls for Å to stop and think. Indeed  out world is on the threshold of a new  more promising era  one in which dialogue and understanding would appear to prevail over confrontation.Within this framework  out Organization  which has come of age  remains an irreplaceable instrument for leading the international community to greater harmony and justice between nations.It is gratifying that the consolidation of peace is gradually gaining ground nowadays. The conclusion  in December 1987  of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  the beginning of negotiations between the two super-Powers to reduce the numbers of strategic nuclear weapons  and the resumption of negotiations to prohibit underground nuclear testing have  in this connection  marked a decisive turning-point. The latest developments announced last week before the General Assembly by President Bush and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the USSR confirm this trend. None the less the fact remains that the progress made falls short of the progress the international community would wish to see take place in so fat as disarmament is concerned. On the other hand  beyond the danger threatening mankind in terms of the existence of enormous means of destruction one must never cease to remind oneself that resources  no less enormous  that are wasted on excessive armament  could certainly be better invested in helping much of humanity to emerge from want and misery.Morocco has taken cognisance  with full interest  of the proposals made and initiatives launched by various European countries in the context of reducing arms across Europe and the establishment of a climate of confidence among States of that continent  which continues to be the theatre of operation of the two major military alliances  even its special position reflecting its geo-political situation  Morocco cannot remain indifferent to all that affects peace and security in the Mediterranean  inasmuch as peace in that region is closely linked with peace all over the European continent  as has been emphasized in the numerous resolutions of the General Assembly as well as in the successive declarations issued by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.Given this fact  the Kingdom of Morocco hopes to see concrete steps taken in the near future in the field of disarmament to transform the Mediterranean into a zone of peace  security and co-operation  free from any disputes and confrontations.We likewise hope that this detente will spur progress at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and enable it to overcome its present period of stagnation and thereby make it possible for productive negotiations to be held with a view to arriving at those agreements we are impatiently awaiting  including an agreement to ban chemical weapons.We should have liked to have seen the region of the Middle East benefit in turn from the encouraging climate of detente now evident in international relations in all parts of the world. But we must note that the intransigence shown by Israel and its blocking of all serious initiatives launched by the Arab side  compel us to give up all grounds for optimism.As the General Assembly will recall the Arab States at the Twelfth Arab Summit Conference held at Fez in 1982  adopted a comprehensive Peace Plan  which was received favourably by the international community. The peaceful solution of the problem has been consecrated by the attitude adopted by the Palestine National Council in last November as well as the statements made by the President of the State of Palestine last December before the General Assembly meeting in Geneva.That peaceful approach enjoyed the backing and encouragement of the entire international community. At the Arab summit held last May in Casablanca to which Morocco played host  the Arab States reaffirmed their adherence to a political solution. They recalled that any settlement roust be based on: Israel's total withdrawal from all Palestinian and Arab territories occupied since 1967  including first and foremost the Arab Al-Quds} the restoration of the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian Arab people  including their right to return to their homeland  self-determination  and the establishment  of their own independent State in Palestine; and the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and all parties to the conflict including the representatives of the State of Palestine  on an equal and independent footing in order to achieve a comprehensive and just solution of the conflict in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) end all the other pertinent United Nations resolutions  as well as the restoration of the national inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and granting security guarantees to all countries of the region  including the State of Palestine.The summit also decided to support the Palestinian position on the question of the elections so that they could take place after the Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories under international control and within the context of a comprehensive peace.The fact that the intifadah has been going on for almost two years now notwithstanding all the repressive end terrorist means employed by Israel  has highlighted the desperate struggle of the Palestinian people to spare no sacrifice to regain their dignity end defend their homeland.The time has come for Israel to put an end to its intransigent policy and to respond to the repeated appeals being launched by the international community in favour of holding a peace conference. Morocco firmly believes that the path of dialogue is the only one that can establish peace in that part of the world.Lebanon  whose very name until recently was synonymous with tolerance and coexistence  is living today an indescribable tragedy. Morocco  which has so many close ties with that brother country  cannot remain indifferent to the tragedy of the Lebanese people. As part of the efforts being constantly made by the Arab States to resolve the Lebanese crisis the last summit meeting at Casablanca decided to establish a tripartite committee composed of His Majesty King Hassan IÃ  the Guardian of the Holy Places  His Majesty King Fahd Ben Abdul-Aziz  and His Excellency  President Chadli Bendjedid. The committee has been striving to put an end to hostilities and to lay the foundations for national reconciliation  lb that end it has been able to put forward a plan aimed at bringing about an immediate cease-fire and making possible a propitious climate of security that would make possible the adoption of the measures necessary to restore constitutional institutions to Lebanon.The Tripartite Committee has succeeded in establishing a cease-fire  and the resulting security committee that emanated from it has worked to ensure that the cease-fire is respected. The positive positions taken by the parties concerned at the meeting of the Lebanese Parliament provide grounds for optimism. We hope the parties will be able to bring about constitutional reform on the basis of the draft document submitted by the Tripartite CommitteeÂ·  reform that would take account of economic political and social developments in the com try.The international community is duty-bound to help Lebanon overcome its ordeal and reach national reconciliation. It must also support legality in Lebanon  based on concord  and consolidate efforts by the State of Lebanon to put an end to Israeli occupation and exercise full sovereignty over all Lebanese territory with a view to protecting its security and stability on its own  as stipulated by the Casablanca Summit Conference.Morocco is satisfied that the cease-fire between two brother countries  Iraq and Iran  has held  under the terms of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We sincerely hope that the provisions of that resolution will be implemented fully in the near future  and that lasting peace between the two countries will be achieved  While Morocco hailed the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan  it cannot but regret that the war drags on. We hope that Afghanistan will regain full sovereignty  its non-aligned status and its freedom to make the political and economic choices it deems necessary for its development  without foreign intervention or pressure.With respect to the Cambodian question  we hope that peace efforts by all parties of goodwill will continue. In that respect  we welcome the Paris Conference  which enabled all the patties to join in dialogue with a view to finding a just and lasting solution to the problem that would guarantee the withdrawal of foreign forces and give the Cambodian people the opportunity to take charge of its own affairs.With the same interest  we follow events  in Cyprus and hail the efforts of the Secretary-General  which aim at ensuring that the dialogue continues between the two communities that make up that non-aligned country and that peace be established within the framework of its territorial integrity and on the basis of respect for the interests of both its communities.The countries of Central America whose efforts resulted in the Tela agreement  are worthy of all our encouragement and support. We sincerely hope that this agreement will be implemented and that the peoples of the region will finally emerge from the cycle of despair and regain peace arid stability.The southern half of the African continent is on the threshold of a historic event for which it has ceaselessly striven. The strenuous efforts made everywhere and  in particular  the enormous sacrifices endured by the Namibian people have at last begin to bear fruit. We are thus witnessing the crumbling of the last Bastion of colonialism in Africa  with the 1 April 1989 commencement of the process envisaged by the peace plan for the independence of Namibia set out in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). I am sure difficulties may surface  but we remain convinced that the path leading the heroic Namibian people to freedom and independence cannot be blocked. Given the wisdom and determination of the Secretary-General  we are certain that the Namibian independence process will proceed in accordance with the wishes of all peace-loving peoples.Mr. Sam Nujoma's recent visit to Morocco and his meeting with His Majesty King Hassan II reflect again the steadfast support my country has always lent the Namibian people and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  as well as our desire to establish ties of constructive co-operation with a free and independent Namibia. Equally  Morocco cannot but voice its gratification over the climate of reconciliation that is beginning to emerge in Angola. We hope that the efforts that led to the Gbadolite meeting in Zaire will continue until all Angolans can live in peace and harmony. For its part  Morocco will remain faithful to its commitment to contribute to all endeavours to secure the unity of the Angolan people and enable them to devote themselves exclusively to achieving development and prosperity.The deteriorating situation in South Africa continues to be of concern to the international community because of its grave and negative effect on the elite of detente that is beginning to emerge in the region. Morocco remains convinced that the international community  as it followed with anxiety the developments in South Africa over the past few weeks  should remain vigilant until the disappearance of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic regime respectful of human dignity and fundamental rights.Since the last session of the General Assembly our region has made major strides towards the long-cherished goal of peace. Our peoples have constantly been aware of belonging to one linguistic and religious community and of sharing the same cultural values.The establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union  therefore  is an imperative  given the nature of the economic and social problems which face our countries  and whose solution requires joint efforts in a regional framework - the more so since current world trends point in the direction of regional integration as a means of standing up to the many challenges we face and as a necessary element for peace  harmony and stability The efforts begun by the five Maghreb Heads of State at their first summit meeting  held at Zeralda  were crowned with the signing  on 17 February 1989 at Marrakech of the Treaty establishing the Arab Maghreb Union comprising Algeria  Libya  Mauritania  Tunisia and Morocco. The Treaty is intended to strengthen the fraternal ties that unite the States members of (the Union and their peoples  and to achieve progress and prosperity for their respective societies  along with the defence of their rights. It is intended also to contribute to preserving a peace based on justice and equity. 'To that end  the Arab Maghreb Union will pursue a joint policy in various spheres and strive gradually to bring about among our countries free circulation of goods  persons and capital  in conformity with the programme of action adopted by the Heads of State.Since the Treaty establishing the Arab Maghreb Union was signed  sustained efforts have been in full swing with a view to developing the Maghreb Integration to the fullest  and making it a reality In every sphere. That Is why hand In hand with the establishment of the Union's institutional bodies we have been working to implement the programme of action.As regards the Union's relations with other regional groups  we declare our determination to strengths ties of co-operation and co-ordination with the Arab Co-operation Council and the Gulf Co-operation Council  on the basis of the common values and purposes that unite us. We also declare our determination to strengthen our co-operation with other economic groupings of our continent  as that is the best way towards broader regional integration. The same strong determination prompts us to establish effective co-operation with the European Economic Community (EEC)  which is moving towards having a single market. The setting up of the Arab Maghreb Union will  of course  facilitate co-operation between the two communities and lead to a more fruitful dialogue that is compatible with the strong economic ties existing between them. We also look forward to establishing economic co-operation with the Council foe Mutual Economic Assistance (CMBA) and other regional groups.Starting from its oft-reiterated commitment to see the problem of the so-called Western Sahara resolved by the holding of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the United Nations  Morocco agreed in principle on 30 August 1988 to the Secretary-General's peace plan.Pursuing his efforts to implement that plan  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar visited our region last June to hold talks with the various parties concerned. As a result of that visit the Secretary-General set up a technical commission which he entrusted with working out the arrangements of implementing the plan.For its part  Morocco will continue to support the efforts of the Secretary-General as well as those of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity. Although the international situation has become relatively more relaxed  the world's economic situation offers not the least glimmer of hope. Political stability will remain fragile so long as it is not accompanied by economic improvements and especially if development continues to be the prerogative of the North.The problems of the South have worsened: to the deterioration in the terms of trade  the rising tide of protectionism  the fall in commodity prices and the fall in the net-flow of resources from abroad we must add the spectre of debt that undermines all the efforts of the developing countries.In the long run  the widening of the gap between North and South can also have negative effects on the economies of the developed countries themselves. Hence out collective responsibility to face up to the problems of underdevelopment that beset the countries of the South. (our duty is to spare no effort in rescuing the numerous developing com tri is trapped in this tragic situation.It is well known today mote than ever before  that it is no longer enough to adapt stop-gap measures with regard to the present order. What we need is a thorough re-examination that will enable us to restructure the world economy  taking into account the interests of both sides within a framework of sincere co-operation.In that connection  the Ministerial Conference of the Group of 77 that was held in Caracas this year responsibly drew up a list of priorities and launched an appeal for a genuine dialogue between North and South that will serve the interests of the international community as a whole.We are hopeful that the special session of the General Assembly on development questions planned for next year will not be a missed opportunity and that it will enable us to pool our efforts in order to adopt concrete measures that will lead to more balanced international economic relations.Although we consider North-South co-operation to be a vital factor for world economic balance  we also feel that South-South co-operation is an indispensable factor. In addition to the fact that such co-operation gives concrete meaning to the concept of solidarity among countries  it also enables them to benefit fully from the complementarity of their resources and from their diverse individual potentials.Morocco has made such co-operation with the developing countries a pivotal concept in its external relations. Indeed  we believe that South-South co-operation can be an important factor in restoring balance to world economic relations.Morocco's increasing co-operation with fraternal countries on the African continent is the best example of our faith in South-South co-operation  d of our desire to translate that faith into a concrete reality. Thus  our country acted as host last March to the first ministerial conference on co-operation in marine resources held by the coastal African States on the Atlantic seaboard.The conference examined the potential of co-operation  which could benefit all the countries concerned  without overlooking the interests of the land-locked African countries. It is a living example of South-South co-operation and a clear illustration of what our countries can accomplish in such vital areas.The deterioration of the environment has become a world-wide concern. Indeed  desertification  the damaging effects of acid rain  the accumulation of dumped toxic substances and the increase in the release of carbonic gases now diffused in the atmosphere have further compounded the development problems with which two thirds of mankind ate already grappling. Such a situation calls for effective international co-operation to adopt the necessary measures. For that reason  the World Climate Conference scheduled for next year and the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development scheduled for 1992 must be carefully planned.In that connection  Morocco  which took the initiative with other States to make the Organization aware of the problem of natural disasters  is especially pleased to see the International Decade for the Reduction of Natural Disasters beginning next year.The scourge of drugs is another phenomenon that requires the mobilization of the entire international community  particularly since recent tragic events in Colombia have shown the extent to which drug-traffickers will go. International co-operation is indispensable if we are to meet this new challenge. On the threshold of the third millennium  the world is undergoing a profound structural change - ideological and political  economic and social  scientific and technological. The problems it is facing - whether they relate to the debt crisis  environmental degradation  or the struggle against drugs - will henceforth have to be tackled on a global scale. International solidarity has indeed become an imperative. It must prompt us to work more closely together in managing world affairs. We have the machinery to achieve that goal - the United Nations. It is our duty - especially since we are all aware of the positive role the Organization is playing - to strengthen it and to give it the means to assume those new responsibilities we wish to confer upon it  so that peace and prosperity may reign throughout the world.In conclusion  I wish the President the fullest measure of success in his work  and hope that we shall indeed make greater strides towards our goals  the essential aspirations shared by all mankind."
"89",4440,"MDG",44,1989,"ï»¿At the behest of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar I wish to convey toMajor-General Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. We have long known his merits and qualities and we trust that in the coming months he will continue to place at the service of the international community the devotion he has demonstrated in the defence of African dignity. His predecessor  Mr  Dante Caputo  guided the work of the forty-third session in an outstanding manner. We appreciated his statesmanlike qualities and his courteous efficiency  and we thank him.Reading the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization reinforced our view that no area of international activity is beyond his ken or sphere of legitimate interest. We were particularly struck by the coherence and lucidity of his description of activities aimed at keeping the peace  preventing conflicts  reducing the threat of war and promoting the settlement of disputes. We assure the Secretary-General of the continued co-operation of the Government of Madagascar in that sphere as in others  and convey to him our best wishes for the successful discharge of his mandate.During this debate the international situation has been analysed thoroughly and in detail  but often in a subjective manner  with events being interpreted from the standpoint of relations between North and South or East and west; it is true that we have not yet been able to rid ourselves of our preconceptions. Granted  there is less recrimination  more openness and a larger number of appeals to common sense and to the need to allay tensions. But at the same time everyone stands ready to defend new positions at a time when the predictable reactions of the cold-war era are no longer a decisive element in the formulation of national policy.We still seek a world free from day-to-day insecurity  a more democratic world  a world where national selfishness has given way to the common interest  a world unequivocally devoted to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Cynics would say we have been trying to do this without too many results for the past 44 years and that we are condemned to instability  because balance - even the balance we are welcoming today - is always precarious.But let us begin to build with what we have and with what we are promised. To be sure  nuclear disarmament and general and complete disarmament are far away  on a distant horizon. But it would be crass to disregard the fact that realignment of the mutual interests of the great Powers and the two principal military blocs and a certain flexibility in stated pre-conditions have permitted the dialogue on arms control to resume.By the summer of 1990 there will be a treaty on a 50 per cent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons  to be followed probably by an agreement on naval nuclear weapons. There has been progress on conventional weapons. Chemical weapons have been the subject of more or less similar proposals by the two super-Powers. Compromise has been reached on verification of underground nuclear tests.. The 1972 Treaty on anti-ballistic missiles is being respected. Finally  to give longer-term perspective to current initiatives  we expect the convening in 1990 of a United Nations conference on the conversion of military industries to civilian use.The list is not as complete as we might have wished  it omits at least two points. Could it be some remaining yearning for rivalry and confrontation between the great Powers that has suppressed mention of zones of peace and co-operation  including that of the Indian Ocean  and of nuclear-weapon-free zones? What role is to be assigned to the United Nations in the multilateral verification of disarmament agreements? It is good to show that we have been moving in the right direction for several years  but it would be even better to take measures to consolidate the international community's confidence in the United Nations in all spheres of international relations.when we mention the United Nations we naturally think of the Secretary-General  of the principal organs  and thus the decision-making procedures. But the most important decisions - relating to aggression  the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security  the settlement of disputes  the International Trusteeship System  and arms control and eventual disarmament - are by statute taken by the Security Council.We want to strengthen the Council's role in the areas of timeliness  effectiveness  credibility and democracy. It is therefore time to review Article 27 of the Charter  in particular its paragraph 3. The veto power  as it is commonly known  has often paralysed the Security Council more than one might have reasonably expected. At a time when the rule of consensus is largely accepted  we should consider either eliminating the clause requiring unanimity among the permanent members or extending it to all members. Coexistence of consensus and the veto is intolerable unless certain members view consensus as the ability to cast a double veto.After that digression - which was not really a digression at all - we wonder  despite our commitment to detente and co-operation  whether the present improvement in the political climate applies everywhere and whether it can survive the test of time and events. We have been disappointed too often in the past  and our experience with volte-faces  unhealthy obstinacy and bad faith on the part of some of our interlocutors hardly justifies excessive  soothing optimism.In southern Africa there is talk of a new constitutional order  fundamental change  dialogue and power-sharing by the year 2000. The gradualists ask us to view this supposed turnaround as auguring the coming of democracy to South Africa. But we see only slogans intended to buy time  offset the negative impact of sanctions and maintain segregation and white supremacy in a country that has been distorted by the persistence of the monstrosities known as Bantustans.We see the problem in two parts: full recognition of black nationalism as the factor that will determine the political  economic and social future of South Africa; and  as a corollary  equal and full enjoyment of political  civil  economic  social and cultural rights by the black majority. Until there is agreement on those two points  and they are translated into reality  everything will remain at the level of good intentions. It is very easy to deny those good intentions by making exceptions of special and emergency situations  and then we can do nothing to put an end to the cycle of cynicism  bitterness  impatience and violence - violent carried out for the sake of freedom  and therefore justified.In the same region  the plan resulting from Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is being applied as best it can in Namibia. The operation is difficult and complex. The casual arrogance of the South African representatives can upset the African nations and put South Africa's impartiality in doubt. We still have the impression that the elections will be just one more opportunity to use manoeuvres and manipulations to frustrate the true aspirations of the Namibian people. Next month will be decisive. I would simply repeat Comrade Sam Nujoma's reference to ""freedom and independence for Namibia in order to permit the advent of peace and  if that is the wish of the minority  national reconciliation"". Our position on Western Sahara has not fundamentally changed. Thanks to the joint efforts of the organization of African Unity and the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the situation has evolved  despite some differences of view. The most important thing at this point is to find a political solution  beginning with direct dialogue between the two parties  within the framework of the agreement in principle of 30 August 1988 between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic.In the Near and the Middle East  in southern and South-East Asia and in Latin America we see particularly disturbing developments. Hardly is a step taken towards a comprehensive and acceptable solution than difficulties appear. They are difficulties inherent in the nature of conflicts and disputes  but they have been put aside for the sake of convenience or because of an excess of optimism. The international community can see here a veritable Penelope's shroud. We are almost powerless as we witness the continuation or the beginning of civil wars  with their train of devastation and refugees and the introduction of distrust  which has become a permanent feature of international relations.How much longer must we wait for the installation of Governments of national reconciliation in Afghanistan and Cambodia? How do we stand with regard to the independent reunification  without outside interference  of the Korean peninsula? When will a just and lasting peace be established between Iran and Iraq? Why Prolong the suffering of Lebanon and tolerate the total stagnation on the question of the Middle East? Ho  can we alia  the Palestinians  whose national rights are internationally recognized  to continue to be the pawn in shameful dealings that create so much suffering? What is the reason for the lack of Progress in the inter-communal talks in Cyprus? Finally  why must the countries of Central America be constantly frustrated in their search for peace  co-operation and reconciliation through dialogue?The settlement of regional conflicts is on the agenda of the regular exchanges of view between the two super-Powers  it should be an integral part of the historic renewal in international relations  but so far it has been regarded as a matter of secondary importance. From time to time some results of diplomacy are brought out into the open  but discreet or secret diplomacy requires that the rest be dealt with behind the scenes. But the situations  the claims and the stakes are well known; we all advocate the same principles and we have together defined the framework for a settlement  here at the United Nations. Therefore  we are all involved in a common undertaking  which cannot be the monopoly of any one party. It is true that on several occasions we have asked the major Powers to use their influence  but that cannot be regarded as a transfer of competence to them alone. We are asking for a little more transparency so that  following the principle of shared security  we may exercise our responsibilities in full knowledge of the situation.My comments apply equally to the economic area. Until there is equal and guaranteed security for all we cannot speak about viable  durable  acceptable or sustainable development. The use from one decade to another oÂ£ various adjectives shows that we are still seeking a development model which takes account of the interests of the whole community. The reports of international institutions would lead one to believe that  at least in its global aspects  the crisis is drawing to an end. Statistics may support the advocates of theoretical interdependence  but the reality is different.The nature of the complaints of the developing countries has not changed. We continue to suffer from a system that has lasted too long  from structures that are inadequate  if not anachronistic  and from one-sided rules of the game. That is true of the fixing of prices for our products  the need to go through certain channels  the organization of international trade  the monetary and financial system and access to technology. We are again speaking of the new international economic order  which means the initiation of global negotiations in the framework of the North-South dialogue to remedy the situation I have described  which has become increasingly intolerable. But the answer is always the same. On the one hand  there is recognition of the need for an interdependent world  the internationalisation of problem-solving and the overlapping nature of the solutions to problems. On the other hand  because of the principle of decentralization Of decision-making  there is insistence that specific points must be discussed within separate institutions and agencies. He hope that the impasse thus created will be ended by the convening in April 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and in particular the revival of economic growth and the development  of the developing countries.In the mean time  as the North-South dialogue will not  as far as we can see  resume soon  we must organize ourselves better in order to take effective control of the authentic path for our own development  and we must revitalize South-South co-operation. He have sometimes thought it sufficient to criticize ourselves  as if our failure resulted more from our hesitation to take decisive collective action in key areas  such as raw materials  monetary questions and the financing of development.Ten years ago  at the sixth summit conference of the non-aligned countries  Madagascar suggested the creation of a stabilization fund  a monetary fund and a development fund for the non-aligned countries and other developing countries. The international environment has changed since then  but our objectives are still the same: to achieve co-ordination on problems of international liquidity; to rebalance international trade  introducing equity and justice; to increase export earnings; and to recycle available resources for development purposes. The establishment of those three funds would be a good thing  bat it would be difficult. Vet we believe more than ever before that an integrated approach to development at the level of analysis and at the level of actual operations and functioning remains essential it we wish to rebuild the world economy on a firm basis of solidarity and mutual trust.These few ideas I have expressed on development and on the reluctance  if not the passivity  of both North and South may appear irrelevant if looked at from the standpoint of the real and immediate problems of international debt.Let us set aside for the moment the well-known controversy over responsibility for the indebtedness  the negative effects of deflation  the postponing or reduction of the debt  the suitability of cultural adjustment programmes  the timeliness of structural adjustment programmes in the African framework  and the impact of current initiatives on political and socio-economic changes. Above and beyond different approaches to understanding and methodology  the objective is always the same  namely  how to manage the debt reasonably while maintaining sustainable development with a human face under the best possible conditions of complementarity and co-ordination.Different approaches are suggested to the debtors. Some have proved successful in specific cases and others benefit from rational analysis at the level of programming and action. New solutions may be desirable  but they must come not from polarization of positions but from agreements between debtors and creditors. The search for such agreement may be made easier within certain forums  including the International Conference on Money and Finance for Development  a conference of debtors  the International Conference on debt and the International Conference on Africa's Eternal Indebtedness.If we recognize that we face a long-term problem which  if not solved  may threaten economic development  the international banking system and even international peace and security  we cannot escape the conclusion that we need to tackle the problem on a multilateral  systematic basis.There is no panacea  but there is nothing to or event our considering certain proposals  including those of Professor Robert A. Mundell  without committing ourselves to then. For example  would it be a viable proposition to combine the potential of the Bank for International Settlements with an informal agency on the model of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  to be called ""general agreement on debt  adjustment and development policies""?History shows that the problem of international debt has existed for over 2 000 years. For the developing countries  this problem is a reality to which they awoke wife some distress 10 years ago  because they had not expected to experience again the catastrophe of the 1920s and 1930s. Indebtedness is permanent in nature. Once a debt accrues the level of development of a country is always assessed in terms of its ability to increase its debt. That is the system? it is for debtors and creditors to ensure that it functions in an orderly manner taking into account foreseeable developments in the political  economic and social situation.Something else that could change our attitude to development is the importance attached in fee last decade to fee environment and the ecosystem as a whole. The public are increasingly aware of the dangers of wastage and exhaustion of resources  pollution and harmful industrial wastes  toxic waste end dumping of such waste  biospheric disruptions  desertification  deforestation  soil erosion and degradation and fee threat of fee extinction of certain vegetable or animal species. For a long time human society  encouraged by the spectacular results of the Industrial Revolution  having accepted the myth of the conquest of new frontiers  believed that production and growth were unlimited. In fact  however  having studied our common heritage  we know its limits. The true danger now is to pursue at all costs a policy of productivity and unbridled competition. It would be irresponsible not to recognize that  in spite of all our efforts  closely interrelated crises persist: crises of development  the environment  energy  debt  population and drugs  that other scourge with disturbing political  social and economic consequences.It was in this context that the member States of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  at their special summit meeting devoted to economic question and debt  in November 1988  welcomed the conclusions of the World Commission on Environment and Development  which was presided over by Gro Harlem Brundtland. They mentioned in particular the conclusion concerning ""sustainable development""  which was defined as""development that responds to the needs of the present without jeopardizing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"". This entire new global strategy is acceptable  but since it deals with various areas we must jointly consider the definition of priorities  rights and responsibilities  the inclusion of that concept in the present system of security and how it fits into the North-South dialogue  the unavoidable changes in methods of production and consumption  national and international commitment  the establishment of a new co-ordination institution and the future of the United Nations Environment Programme.Before 1992  fee which an international conference on environment and development has been proposed  specific proposals could be put forward and discussed with a view to establishing international co-operation and action in the ecological sphere. As I develop my ideas in this statement I realize that the challenge of development is a difficult one but that it is our duty to accept it and succeed. Each nation or group of nations must strive to find the best means of doing so  conscious of the limitations imposed by the surrounding crisis. We have turned to our traditional partners. We have followed the suggestions of financial and monetary institutions. Now we need new concepts that can help us to emerge as quickly as possible from the present uncertain situation.On the political level  the United Nations has made a spectacular recovery  helped by its ability to define an appropriate framework for settlement and by renewed confidence in multilateralism. On the conceptual level  there is no reason why the United Nations should not be able to achieve in development what it has achieved in peace-keeping. We agree that there should be an overall reorganization of the United Nations  not only to maintain international peace and security or facilitate the adjustment or settlement of disputes  but also  to use the words of the Charter ""To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character"". No gratuitous challenge is being made to the existing system  although there is no unanimity on this point. Prom time to time  however  we need to take a new look at the Charter  particularly Chapters IX and X in the light of our experiences  existing situations and the expected results. It would not be wise to juggle with the role of the Economic and Social Council  with regard to co-operation for development. If one accepts the idea of the collective responsibility of Members and the ability of the United Nations to guarantee world security  one cannot disregard the economic dimension of international security.We must pursue our argument to its logical conclusion and say that comprehensive security must be taken into account in all spheres of international activity  even though we may be accused of bringing back exclusivism and opportunism in the service of causes which are not necessarily supported by all."
"90",4478,"MDV",44,1989,"ï»¿It is indeed a pleasure for me and the members of my delegation to extend to Ambassador Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election to this high office is a well-deserved tribute to his personal qualities and experience. I am fully confident that under his able and wise leadership the Assembly will further consolidate the gains achieved during the past year.My delegation associates itself with previous speakers in expressing its appreciation of the dedicated efforts of his predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo  for the exemplary manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.As in previous years  my delegation wishes to note its satisfaction with and gratitude for the assiduous and unrelenting efforts exerted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the cause of peace and international harmony. We pay a tribute to him for his untiring efforts to promote conditions conducive to the realization of the noble principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  we praise and congratulate him on the successes the Organization has achieved in recent years. More particularly we praise him for the renewed faith and regeneration of confidence in the Organization and its ability to Play an instrumental role in the peaceful settlement of disputes.  Today we find ourselves at an important crossroads. Recent years have witnessed a welcome positive change in the international political climate. The confrontational tone evident in super-Power relations not too long ago continues to show signs of thawing. At the same time   a number of regional and sub regional conflicts have taken momentous strides towards resolution. Many more protracted conflicts show signs of hope and movement. Though one might argue that the present situation continues to be delicate  the process made can hardly escape notice and is indeed worthy of recognition. Developments in southern Africa  and more particularly in Namibia with regard to the implementation of the United Nations independence plan  are welcome signals of hope  but amidst the hopes there are still dark reminders of the precariousness of global political reconciliation. A number of problems remain unsolved and several of these  such as the conflicts in the Middle East  continue to simmer.We are therefore at an important crossroads. We feel that there is enough good will to set in motion the process of evolution towards peace and stability. We see signs that the human intellect is resourceful enough to devise ideas that are conducive to our survival. Fresh concepts of peace and security have gained currency  but at the same time we continue to live under the dark shadow of nuclear devices. The proliferation of nuclear weapons  both horizontally and vertically  is a tragic reminder of the difficulties and obstacles which stand between mankind and lasting peace.On the economic front hard choices need to be made. The 1980s have witnessed one of the longest spells of growth for the industrialized countries  while the situation in the South  particularly in the least developed countries  continues to deteriorate. Benefits of trade continue to be disproportionate. Commodity prices have not regained their value in real terms. Aid flows continue to be inadequate. The debt burden borne by many third world countries is stifling economic growth and efforts for development  causing political instability. The link between economic development and the environment has recently been recognized and it is encouraging to note the high profile given to environmental issues at the Paris summit meeting of the Group of Seven in July this year  in this regard  it is of particular interest that there is an increasing awareness and acceptance of the fact that certain technologies have a deleterious effect on the environment. The question is how these technologies can be replaced through a global programme of co-operation.No single fact  no single object  defines our moment in civilization more than does the existence of large nuclear arsenals. we have the horrible capacity to destroy our planet several times other  either by accident or by design. Nuclear weapons instil fear and beget mistrust and insecurity. They have a remarkable tendency to set hostile relations in concrete. They aggravate the security dilemma of states and perpetuate a confliction mode of behaviour. This  therefore  fuels the arms race and defence budgets soar while expenditures that are benevolent tend to plummet. The UN Conference on the relationship between disarmament and development served as a timely reminder of the opportunity costs of armaments  both nuclear and conventional. However the opportunity cost of nuclear weaponry is not only development. The international political climate and the security perceptions of states  as well as the environment  are actual and potential sacrifices tonuclear weapons. Furthermore. the potential horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons issues the stark and grim warning that regional rivalries would be on an ever shorter fuse and that cataclysm would be that much closer.It is in view of these strong objections  to nuclear weapons and their Proliferation and deployment that my delegation has consistently and strongly supported United Nations calls for disarmament.The confidence that can he derived from genuine arms reduction has a pervasive effect on the security environment. The transition that many of the world's conflict  are making towards negotiations and understanding owes a great deal to improved relations between the super-Powers  which were themselves in part inspired by the historic arms reduction agreement of December 1987 for this reason -at Maldives has always supported all efforts with a view to general and complete disarmament  including the total elimination of chemical and bacteriological weapons and reduction in conventional armaments. We also believe that nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace could inspire trust  good Will and operation among states  transforming into secure communities contributing to global peace and security. We therefore support calls for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. I express my delegation's fullest support for the people of Namibia  with our Namibia achieved their independence.  Apartheid is an affront to mankind and a crime against humanity. No amount of tinkering with it can placate the sense of outrage and indignation felt by the world community for this immoral practice. No amount of cosmetic change can restore Justice and dignity to the oppressed majority in South Africa. Maldives express our solidarity with the oppressed majority in South Africa in their struggle against apartheid. We condemn unequivocally the system of apartheid and condemn Pretoria regime for its continued defiance of the UN resolutions.  By far the greatest conflict in our time has been and continues to be the conflict in the Middle East. At the heart of this conflict is the question of Palestine. However  it is only in recent years that the Palestinian issue has evoked even a reasoned amount of concern in some key States. The search for peace continues to be frustrated by the hard-line and obstinate policies of Israel. Meanwhile  the situation in the occupied territories continues to deteriorate. The 22 month long intifadah emphasizes the intensity of the situation posed by Zionist occupation of Palestine and other Arab territories  including Jerusalem.The Government of Maldives strongly condemns the use of brutal force and the blatant abuse of human rights by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. We also deplore the continued defiance by Israel of United Nations resolutions and its violation of international law and all norms of civilized behaviour. We reiterate our full support and solidarity with the people of Palestine in their just struggle for self-determination and independence. We therefore welcome the overwhelming international support for the uprising  which is being viewed as the just and valiant struggle of the Palestinian people for the restoration of their inalienable rights. We extend our whole-hearted support to the proposal for an early convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the full and independent participation of Palestine.The situation in Lebanon remains volatile. The civil war  now in its fifteenth year  continues to take an increasing toll of human life. We fervently hope that  with the developments taking place in the region and elsewhere  the question of Lebanon will be solved in a manner which will restore its independence and national integrity  and alleviate the sufferings of its people. We welcome the efforts undertaken by the members of the Arab league  both past and present  to resolve the situation in Lebanon and we request the international community to give their support to the people of Lebanon in their efforts to solve their problems.On a more hopeful note  we are pleased that  contrary to some early pessimistic assessments  the cease-fire agreed on between Iran and Iraq in the Gulf has held firm  indicating the sincerity of the parties to the conflict. We welcome the commitments undertaken by them to resolve the conflict by peaceful means. In particular  we applaud the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General for the resolution of this conflict and urge both parties to maintain the momentum of peace created and envisaged by the cease-fire. While we welcome the positive developments in Afghanistan - I refer to the withdraw of foreign troops - we regret that the situation has not been completely settled. We reiterate our call upon all parties concerned to adhere to the provisions of the Geneva Agreements in order not to frustrate the prevailing opportunities for a just and lasting solution to the problem. We urge the international community to provide humanitarian and economic assistance for the relief and rehabilitation of refugees  as well as for the long-term reconstruction of that ravaged country.  Positive strides have been taken towards the solution of the Kampuchean problem. We welcome the withdraw of the Vietnamese troops and we appreciate the diplomatic efforts to obtain a comprehensive and lasting solution to the dispute including the Jakarta informal meeting as well as the international conference in Paris. However  realizing the delicacy of the current situation  we call upon all parties concerned to exercise restraint. The process of reunification of peoples should be through peaceful means and by the creation of conditions conducive to reconciliation  peace and stability among those sharing the same aspirations. We remain optimistic about the prospects for peaceful national reconciliation in the Korean peninsula. The good office of the UN could be utilized in these peace negotiations.  Another issue that needs our attention is the situation in Cyprus. That prolonged inter-communal dispute should be solved urgently  with due regard to the national integrity of the nation and the aspirations of its peoples. We welcome the recent high-level contacts between the two communities and hope that the revived inter-communal dialogue will lead to inter-communal reconciliation on the basis of equality and integrity for both communities. We commend the tireless and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General in searching for a settlement to the conflict.As I have already noted  the world economic situation continues to be bleak for the developing countries. Their situation has been worsened by the limited of aid since the early 1980s  rampant domestic inflation  crippling debts and the exorbitant burden of debt-servicing. The situation is aggravated by their falling share in international trade  by persistent negative trends in the terms of trade  owing to protectionism  and by the upsurge in unilateralism and other practices that jeopardize the multilateral nature of trade. It is regrettable that  on the whole  despite recent measures whereby the resources of the international finance institutions have been increased by the plans of some of the most developed countries to recycle part of their surplus into the developing countries  the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP) as official development assistance has not been met. Moreover  as regards the least developed countries  which continue to register negative growth rates  the official development assistance target of 0.15 per cent of GNP has not been met either.Economic insecurity is not the only visible threat facing many of us in the world today. Indeed  we consider the environment to be one of the most important aspects of the quality of life that we have to address now in our quest for economic and industrial development. We welcome the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development and regard the event as a valuable opportunity which should be fully utilized to promote a comprehensive approach to the environmental problems related to the development activities of mankind.While serious efforts are being made at global  regional and national levels to protect the environment  my delegation is particularly concerned about the effects of the degradation of the environment  especially the depletion of the ozone layer and the consequent global warming and rise in sea level. Maldives is a low-lying archipelagic State  entirely dependent upon its surrounding seas. Any degradation of the marine ecosystem  or any rise in the mean sea level  is a matter of grave concern to the Maldives  it will be recalled that two years ago we witnessed the fury of tidal eruptions  which caused extensive damage  with the assistance of friendly countries  we have embarked upon a programme of protecting the populated islands from possible natural calamities. Tidal waves  hurricanes and typhoons are increasingly frequent phenomena  and today there is a greater awareness that man's tampering with the environment and certain technologies inimical to the environment do have a direct bearing on the behaviour of the global weather system.Maldives therefore strongly supports the call for environmental preservation and is already a party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Our interest in the issue continues undiminished  and we welcome the universal interest that has been expressed in the preservation of the environment. I should like also to mention that in November this year the Maldives will host a conference of small States on sea-level rise. We are confident that the conference will contribute to the global efforts in addressing this important issue.It is an old and true maxim that the best indicator of the strength and stability of an international security system or political order is the survival of its weakest members. That being the case  and in view of the implications  the ever-increasing dangers of terrorism and mercenarism to the sovereignty of small and weak States are appalling.Terrorism is not simply a minor irritant to anybody - least of all  to the small nations whose sovereignty is not only held hostage but can be easily usurped. The very existence of this possibility in the first place does not augur well for the security of the international community. The cherished principles that have so long contributed to the survival of the present State system and that are indispensable values of our global civilization are at stake. Today it may be we  the small States  whose sovereignty can be robbed by a handful of mercenaries or a gang of bounty hunters. Tomorrow it could be the larger countries  which  even at present  face some erosion of their sovereignty and security by similar acts. The difference is that when a small State is subjected to a terrorist onslaught or an invasion by mercenaries the consequences can be irreversible  both in political and in economic terms. We in the Maldives were close to becoming the victim of such a dastardly attempt last November.It is evident that peoples engaging in acts of terrorism and mercenarism  which endanger the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  need to be deterred. The security of small States is too weak to be taken care of by mere self-help. The implications that efforts to strengthen their own security have for the prospects of economic development through the severe  if at all affordable  opportunity costs and the impact on social and political values  as well as the long-term implications for the sustenance of democracy in a militarised society  are negative. By requesting the inclusion on the agenda of the Assembly of an item related to the protection and security of small States  we sought to highlight the issue that I have just mentioned. We brought the issue to this forum not because we are unwilling to defend our values  nor have we taken it up here because our peoples lack valour. Small States do have as friends States that can assist  and have assisted  in strengthening their security. While we are grateful for the sense of duty that these friends have shown  it is with regret that we note that bilateral security arrangements in the international system have not yet evolved to a level of maturity whereby the interests of the weaker partner can be safeguarded. Nor are the socio-political identity of the weaker State and the principle of sovereign equality strong enough to be impervious to the possible vicissitudes of unequal relationships. Moreover  our political systems continue to be afflicted by misconceptions which can distort actions taken with the best of intentions. Consequently  the greater the power differential  the greater the propensity to misconceptions and the more hapless the predicament of the weaker parties. It is for this reason that we believe that multilateral frameworks are the most feasible nodes of a sound security mechanism for the weakest Members of the Organization  even if the actual support or assistance in a given situation is rendered at a regional or bilateral level.As I noted earlier  it is my humble opinion that we are at a pivotal point  an important crossroads in our global political development. It is our belief that we are at a particularly auspicious moment in history to forge ahead in strengthening the norms of our global political and security systems. Thus it is our sincere hope that the Organization will take a similar momentous step  a leap forward in ushering in a new era of security for the small States. We trust that this critical step will be taken to safeguard the principles which are espoused by the Organization and on which the survival of a large number of this community depends."
"91",4525,"MEX",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government of Mexico  I congratulate the President on his election to preside over the work of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.To the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  we again extend special thanks for his positive  judicious and persevering work at the head of the United Nations. Thanks to his diligence  no one can now question the Organization's decisive role in international relations  as the essential catalyst in the diplomatic activity of resolving through negotiation and dialogue the conflicts threatening our collective peace and security.This is the first time the Government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari  President of Mexico  has taken part in the Assembly's general debate. On his behalf  I again express my country's commitment to the purposes and principles of our Organization. Mexico is a founding Member of the United Nations. We have invariably supported its activities. The principles embodied in its Charter and its guiding purposes are fully in accord with our firm belief in an international community of nations  equal before the law and committed in peace and solidarity to the goal of growth with justice. We believe in the United Nations  because it enshrines the need to ensure that reason prevails over force. In a world still marked by the inequality and despair of so many  the United Nations is a clear example that we as human beings ore capable of working together for a better common future  regardless of ideologies and passing interests.Over the past few months the international community has witnessed changes pointing to the end of an era of confrontation. For Mexico it is encouraging that the stereotypes of rivalry have been replaced by new concepts of co-operation and understanding. These advances teach us that solving the grave problems confronting international life is not an impossible objective.The Mexican Government warmly welcomes the conclusion of the Tela agreements  signed by the Presidents of Costa Rica  Guatemala  Honduras  El Salvador aid Nicaragua. We unconditionally support the efforts made to find a lasting solution to a conflict which has bled white the Central American isthmus. Tela is the culmination of an arduous and complex negotiating process. We urge the international community to support the agreements and to ensure that they are not obstructed by interests from outside the area.The responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations in the process of bringing peace to Central America are clearly of the utmost importance. The success of the United Nations elections observer mission in Central America and of the International Verification and Follow-Up Commission will largely depend on the co-operation they receive from member States and on full respect for the wishes of the region's Heads of State.Mexico will continue to extend its firm support for the efforts of the Central American Presidents to achieve peace  since peace is vital for the development of the peoples and the consolidation of democracy in the region.The accomplishments on the political front have not meant parallel advances in the international economic arena  while States have committed their power and prestige to the solution of political conflicts  they are seeking to correct the profound economic imbalances by turning loose market forces  forgetting that those are the principal cause of the political tensions in many regions of the world.The economic gap between North and South is wider than it was a decade ago  and we have done little to reverse the trend. For Latin America this has been a period of outright stagnation. The enormous transfer of resources to the developed world which we have made during this time has tested our peoples to the limit and threatens to destabilize our political institutions.We cannot be ambiguous in confronting the problems facing us. It is now necessary to apply the same dedication to correcting economic imbalances as we have applied to the correction of political imbalances. Notwithstanding some differences of approach  there is general agreement that we are now at a watershed in world history. The next century must be spared the agonies of war and the extreme poverty that still afflicts millions of human beings  if liberty is to flourish and democracy is to have a real chance to survive.How can the United Nations contribute to shaping the twentyâfirst century? The decade of the 1990s will be a crucial stage in fashioning that new reality. The agenda for action is long and complex  but Mexico considers that there are four major themes around which our thoughts and actions may converge.The first theme is the democratisation of international society. The Organization's institutional structure will have adequately to reflect the profound changes and the multi-polarity which characterize current international society. We continue to be constrained by the system devised by the victors in the Second World War  in spite of the fact that we are living in a very different world  whose make-up has been radically changed by the widespread process of decolonisation and the redistribution of economic and financial power at the international level.We believe that we shall be able to entrust our Secretary-General with the task of closely examining the different proposals that have been formulated for reorganizing the Organization's structure and operation  as well as the distribution of authority between the Security Council and the General Assembly  in order to reach a consensus which will give a new thrust to the Organization so that it can efficiently carry out its future responsibilities.The United Nations urgently requires our effective support. Mexico urges every country with financial contributions outstanding to make them immediately. The financial crisis is so grave that it could bring down the United Nations at any moment. It is incomprehensible that day after day we ask the Organization to shoulder more responsibilities and yet we fail to provide it with the means to do so.The second theme is the need for the United Nations to intervene in problems of economic co-operation and development. The Organization cannot be left out of this great effort to create a more equitable international economic situation. Mexico vigorously supports the holding of a special session of the General Assembly for economic co-operation and revitalization. The developing countries know that the solution to our problems depends fundamentally on ourselves. We have lost much time in talks trying to resolve these problems  with very tenuous results. It is certainly true that changing prices and financial fluctuations have been cruelly unfavourable for us in recent years  but there is no doubt that the internal effort of each country is the fundamental and determining factor in correcting our present situation. Let us begin by adjusting and modernizing our economies and making them efficient. Only in this way will we be able to increase our productivity and international competitiveness to the benefit of our peoples. Let us accept that the future of each of our nations depends precisely on what each one of them does.By means of a wide range of concerted action and dialogue between the various sectors of our society  Mexico is resolutely making progress in an effort towards structural change  which entails sacrifice and discipline on the part of the Mexican people. The result has been encouraging  it has been reflected in a significant reduction in inflation and an economy confident of its future.The correction of our economies is indispensable  but it is not a sufficient condition. There is no internal adjustment  however deep and lasting  which can bear fruit unless the country in question encounters a favourable international climate. The new international development strategy will have to put forward ambitious yet feasible and realistic objectives and goals. To this end. it will have to be designed in keeping with the efforts for cooperation and for maximization of the benefits of interdependence  which must in no case mean a loss of sovereignty.The revitalization of international economic co-operation is urgent. It is the developed countries - those creditor nations benefiting from the net transferof capital - which must take the necessary steps to correct the imbalances in this area  it is up to them to realize that when structural adjustments are made  they mean growth and prosperity  and not frustration as has been the case in many of our societies. Prescriptions for good economic management and financial discipline cannot be measured with one yardstick for the North and another for the South. It was encouraging to hear various representatives of the industrialized countries refer to this problem of the great economic difference between North and South. We are sure that these statements imply that a commitment on this will be made in this new era of the United Nations we are witnessing.The third key issue for society today is the commitment to deal with the international critical problems of our times with a genuine sense of shared responsibility. At best  interdependence should mean our ability to turn international co-operation into an effective tool to encourage economic and social progress and take joint action to solve problems of interest to mankind. Shared responsibility is based on the recognition of the legal equality of States and on strict respect for their sovereign decisions. This is the only legitimate framework for North-South dialogue.With this spirit of solidarity  we shall be able to cope successfully with the common defence of human rights  with environmental protection problems and the fight against drug addiction and trafficking.For the Government of Mexico  the defence of fundamental freedoms is of Particular importance. We will continue in our resolute support for the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human rights with a view to guaranteeing effective protection for the rights inherent in the human condition. The United Nations will also have to devote greater efforts to the consideration of women's rights and the protection of children  the most vulnerable Ecological issues are obviously global. in scale. The need for all nations to join efforts  every type of effort  make the United Nations the forum we need to deal with these urgent matters so vital to our future.An understanding that revitalizing growth in the developing countries is indispensable for achieving adequate protection of the environment is crucial. It should not be overlooked that the principal cause of ecological imbalances and the solutions for then lie with these who have the most  with those who pollute the most and emit toxic substances  with those who consume the most fuel and have consumed the most fuel in the past. It is those very countries which have the most resources to combat environmental degradation.The new dimension of the problem and its international nature require a wide-ranging and intense process of debate and discussion. The objective will be to achieve concrete commitments in keeping with the responsibilities and capabilities of each country. The International Conference on Environment andDevelopment proposed for 1992 will be an extremely important exercise towards those ends.The demand for narcotics and psychotropic substances and their production  traffic and illicit consumption threaten the physical health of peoples and the political  economic  social and cultural structures of States. This is another of the global and interdependent problems of our times  and eradicating it requires efficient and constructive action through international co-operation which unfailingly respects the sovereignty and cultural identities of nations. We therefore welcome the signing of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in Vienna in December last year. We hope that the signatories will immediately decide to ratify it  and we urge those countries which have not yet ratified it to do so now. We also view with admiration and great respect the very valiant efforts being deployed by theGovernment of Colombia to combat the drug traffic so resolutely in its country. The war in Colombia is not just a war involving Colombians) it should be a war waged by all countries of the world  as the problem is everyone's problem.Mexico  for its part  is making a significant effort to combat drug trafficking. We know  though  that the struggle will be in vain unless there is a parallel campaign to combat consumption and against all the processes which finance and encourage drug abuse. To combat only drug production or traffic without at the same time resolutely tackling consumption will achieve only a shift in production sites and trafficking channels.The fourth topic deserving of our attention is the reappraisal of the function of the State as a protagonist in economic processes and as agent of social well-being. Redirecting the function of the State to concentrate its efforts to serving the least protected sectors in our societies  which are undoubtedly in the majority  does not mean diminishing its power of governance and transformation. The demands for justice coming from developing societies must be channelled by the State and its legitimate representatives. The State must participate as a directing and an economic agent and should do so efficiently  productively and competitively  lb consider the role of the State in these times in a more wide-ranging and realistic manner  in both North and South  is a fundamental task  and one which we think should be carried out by our Organization.Whether on its own initiative or in response to express requests  the United Nations today is an indispensable part in negotiating and implementing agreements to put an end to protracted conflicts throughout the world. However  there is still no peace in various regions  and the threat these conflicts represent is a real danger.In the Middle East  Cambodia  Namibia and Central America our Organization takes the leadership in or supports delicate conciliation efforts at establishing peace. Mexico will continue to give its support to those efforts  upon the success of which lies the possibility of achieving a better world.Mexico attaches the utmost importance to the question of general and complete disarmament. Activities undertaken by the Group of Six  an organization which at first was erroneously judged as Utopian  have already achieved concrete results. The repeated appeals of the Group to the nuclear Powers to stop the arms race have been well received and have hastened the climate of detente in which we live today  as well as the agreements readied by the super-Powers.I shall now refer to the question of general and complete disarmament. Mexico unequivocally supports the complete cessation of all nuclear weapons testing as demanded by the majority of mankind. Together with Peru  Indonesia  Sri Lanka  Venezuela and Yugoslavia  we are taking the initiative in presenting an amendment to the agreement prohibiting nuclear-arms testing in the atmosphere  outer space and under water  which has received the general support of the international community. Encouraging progress has also been made towards eliminating the terrible threat of chemical weapons. It is very satisfying to note the consolidation of the negotiating process between the countries of the Warsaw Pact and those of the Atlantic Alliance concerning the reduction of conventional armed forces.We are now living through one of the most promising times in the life of our Organization since it was founded in 1945. we are nearing the end of a period of mistrust and ill will which  for more than 40 years  blocked possibilities for agreement and negotiations The artificial barriers of the cold war are crumbling on all sides. We are entering a more open world  one with better communications and more receptive to the need for human rights to be respected and for all to participate in the building of democratic government institutions. Myths that for years have served only to hide injustice are no longer acceptable. Peoples around the world have decided to take their destinies into their own hands.This flourishing of determination must increase our spirit of tolerance and our concern for legality. Demands throughout the societies of the world that democratic institutions be increased and improved are being channelled through the existing structures of each country. Those voices can no longer be ignored. Each nation has the capacity to draw upon the lessons of its own history and experience  which will tell it how to modernize its institutions in order to strengthen its sovereignty.This climate of change throughout the world has made us aware that the solutions to global problems cannot be left in the hands of only a few countries  however powerful they may be. Halting the deterioration of the environment  combating drug addiction and trafficking and predicting natural disasters are tasks requiring multilateral action. The Assembly must move towards recognizing that the United Nations is more necessary than ever given the interdependence of the modern world.We cannot take pride in what we have achieved if we do not accept that the growth of the developing countries is an issue that affects us all. This requires a fresh approach to international co-operation  since only social and economic progress in the developing world can guarantee security and stability in the twenty-first century. The persistence of stagnation and poverty in the world's most populous regions is the most serious challenge we face. Let us see to it that this session of the Assembly marks the beginning of a period in which the international community as a whole makes a clear commitment effectively and realistically to take up and meet this challenge.*"
"92",4620,"MLI",44,1989,"ï»¿  The Mali delegation  which I have the honour to lead  extends its warmest congratulations to Ambassador Garba on his election to preside over the forty-fourth session. His election honours all of Africa  and we are all the more pleased since his country  the Federal Republic of Nigeria  maintains excellent relations of friendship and co-operation with the Republic of Mali. My delegation is convinced that his personal qualities and his rich diplomatic experience  which have won him the confidence of the General Assembly  guarantee that our work will be successful.I take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the effective and wise way in which he directed the work of the forty-third session. I also wish to express my delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his constant efforts to realize the ideals of the United Nations. The fruitful co-operation that existed during the term in office that President Moussa Traore has just ended at the head of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) enabled us to appreciate his great devotion to the cause of peace and co-operation between peoples. I extend to him the sincere thanks of the Republic of Mali for his constant understanding and willingness to help in the quest for solutions to African problems.Since the last session the international political situation has continued to develop favourably  and there has been a political relaxation in the relations between the two major Powers. However  for the nations that constitute the third world there remain many uncertainties and subjects of concern which form an obstacle to a positive evolution of the world climate and provide challenges to be met. They include natural disasters; economic and financial constraints and the debt crisis  unsuitable remedies put forward by international financial and  monetary institutions the persistence of the apartheid regime and of the grave situation in the Middle East and the intifadah and many hotbeds of tension that continue in many parts of the world in spite of the increasingly expressed resolve to eliminate them. In a few weeks there will be a self-determination referendum in Namibia that will set the Namibian people on the noble and lofty course of independence and freedom.Being well aware of the strategy of the Pretoria racists  which is constantly to resort to delaying tactics  the Organization of African Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries have deplored the reduction in the numbers of those making up the United Nations Transition Assistance Group  because they know the real dangers of such reductions.Our fears have been confirmed by the massacres of Namibian fighters that darkened the initial days of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the recent assassination of Anton Åubowski  the incorporation into the South African security forces in Namibia of elements of the Koevoet  which is a veritable death squad  and the intimidation of Namibians by the South African security forces - in a word  by all the sordid plots hatched by the Pretoria racists.The intentions of the Pretoria racists always remain the same: to perpetuate their colonial domination in Namibia and to establish in the Territory a Government that does their bidding. In the past the goal was to destroy the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  the authentic representative of the Namibian people  today it is to prevent  by all sorts of fraudulent manoeuvres  SWAPO's winning the elections.In this context  we urge the Security Council to take the appropriate measures to control the situation in Namibia effectively and completely  in order to ensure that the independence process proceeds correctly. In that regard  we welcome the recent measures taken by the Security Council to increase the number of police officers attached to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.In any event  the November elections must result in genuine independence for Namibia. A perverted independence and a failed decolonisation would betray all the sacrifices made by the heroic Namibian people and the commendable efforts of the international community to assert the inalienable rights of peoples and to protect international peace and security.In South Africa itself  the lot of the black majority has not improved since our last session. The black population is still denied its most basic rights. The state of emergency is still in force  despite the repeated appeals of the international community. Arrests  arbitrary judgements and summary executions continue at a frenzied pace.The Pretoria racists must yield to the evidence that repression  however fierce  will never succeed in stifling a people's aspirations to freedom nor in overcoming their desire for liberation. The continuation of the people's revolt  which is broadening in South Africa  in spite of violent repression  bears eloquent witness to that.What is needed in South Africa is the establishment of a democratic  multiracial and egalitarian regime  installed by free elections. For that to be achieved  it is essential that the state of emergency be lifted  that Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners be unconditionally freed  that discriminatory laws be repealed and that all South Africans  without distinction as to race  enjoy the right to vote.The Declaration on South Africa adopted by the ad Hoc Committee of Heads of State and Government on Southern Africa in Harare on 21 August should be the basis of any negotiations to that end. Much is being said about changes that have occurred in the leadership of the political party in power in South Africa and about the new spirit of openness of the new President and of his desire for a change in policy in South Africa. We do not harbour any illusions: apartheid cannot be tolerated it must be totally dismantled and it is only if actions by the new leaders of the racist regime of South Africa ate taken along this path that we will appreciate them.My country is convinced that the international community roust remain vigilant in view of the manoeuvres of the racist regime of Pretoria  and at the special session of the General Assembly on the policy of apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa  planned for next December  we shall express our complete solidarity with the valiant people of South Africa.In Angola  we are pleased with the establishment of dialogue between the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and UNITA  a dialogue we fervently hope will lead to genuine peace in that country. We therefore urge all patties to abide by the Gbadoli agreements and take specific steps in keeping with the aspirations of the Angolan people to unity  peace and social and economic development.In Western Sahara  the joint efforts of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Secretary-General have led to the development of a settlement plan for this question in accordance with resolutions 104 (XIK) of the OAU and 40/50 of the General Assembly. Acceptance of the plan in August 1988 by the two parties - the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front - is an important step in the process towards the organization of a free and general referendum on self-determination. It is true that obstacles remain  but the establishment last June of the Technical Commission for the Implementation of the Plan will certainly make it possible to overcome them. Aware of the seriousness of the situation  my delegation urges the Kingdom of Morocco and the POLE ARIO to embark on a dialogue with a view to a just and definitive solution to that painful conflict. As a country of the region  the Republic of Mali  will continue  as in the past  to work towards a settlement of the conflict.In another area  there have been positive developments in the Chad-Libya conflict since July 1989  thanks to the summit meeting held at the initiative of the Head of State of Mali  General Moussa Traore  which convened in Bamako his peers from Algeria  Gabon  Nigeria  Libya and Chad. The signing of a framework agreement between the two countries on 31 August in Algiers offers good prospects for a definitive solution to that dispute.In the Middle East  the Palestinian people is still waging its heroic struggle to recover its- national rights. The most heroic expression of that struggle is the intifadah - that revolt of the people in the occupied territories which has mobilized Palestinians into the streets  including a large number of women and children  who are standing up unarmed to the Israeli occupation forces which  in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949  ate committing acts of torture and carrying out massacres. The current generation of stone throwers is a new category of martyrs of the Palestinian people whose sacrifice invites the international community to undertake firm and resolute action to compel Israel to recognize the inalienable national rights of that people.My delegation is convinced that the problem of the Middle East  at the core of which is the question of Palestine  requires a comprehensive settlement. In this regard it supports the idea of convening an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation of  the five permanent members of the Security Council and of all parties to the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  on an equal footing.The persistent upheaval in Lebanon and the present tragedy of the Lebanese people are direct consequences of the Middle East problem. The Malian people deplore these tragic events. We appeal to the international community at large to do more to restore peace to that country  by preserving its independence and its territorial integrity  in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and the deployment of the United Nations Interim force in Lebanon. My delegation supports and encourages the mediation efforts now being made by the Tripartite Committee of the Arab League to find a solution to that tragedy.In agreeing to observe a cease-fire  Iran-Iraq have contributed to restoring calm to the Gulf region  thus facilitating the efforts of the Secretary-General with a view to resolving that fratricidal conflict.In Afghanistan  General Assembly resolution 43/20 welcomed with satisfaction the signing of the Geneva Agreements on 14 April 1988  an important step towards a definitive settlement of the conflict. In spite of the withdrawal of Soviet troops  calm has not been restored in Afghanistan. The 1988 Agreements are in jeopardy the United Nations good offices mission in Afghanistan and in Pakistan is not enjoying the desired co-operation. It is therefore up to the parties concerned  as well as the United States and the Soviet Union  which are the guarantors of these Agreements  to co-operate with the United Nations in order to make it possible to arrive at a negotiated settlement. In connection with South-East Asia  the informal meetings between the parties to the struggle in Kampuchea  known as the Jakarta Pounds  and the recent international peace conference on Cambodia in Paris have harmonized the positions of the parties with a view to a negotiated settlement of the Cambodian question without any foreign interference.In the Korean peninsula  the resumption of talks will undoubtedly contribute to the peaceful settlement of the question  lb that end  we support the efforts made by the Korean people towards peaceful reunification through a North-South dialogue  without interference and in accordance with the three principles of independence  peaceful reunification and general national unity  as contained in the joint North-South declaration of 4 July 1972. My delegation is convinced that a reunified and strong Korea could legitimately be represented in the United Nations. We therefore urge all parties to work actively toward the attainment of the peaceful reunification of Korea prior to its admission to the United Nations. My delegation is pleased at the positive evolution of the political situation in Central America  which leads to hope for peace in the region. We also highly appreciate the political will demonstrated by the Heads of State of Central America to give effect to Security Council resolution 637 (1989)  adopted on 27 July 1989. In this respect  the summit meeting in Honduras in August was significant and the agreements signed on that occasion will contribute to strengthening peace and security in the region.The settlement of regional conflicts undoubtedly contributes significantly to the safeguarding of international peace and security  but the basic prerequisite for the establishment of lasting peace in the world remains general and complete disarmament  to the benefit of social and economic development for all mankind.The arms race conducted by the two blocs in addition to being a permanent threat to the survival of the human race absorbs substantial resources. It might be sand that mankind is made to produce the means of its own destruction.According to reliable sources  the intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles which were the subject of an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987 represent only about 4 per cent of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons. That is certainly not a great deal. None the less  it is appropriate to welcome that initiative  which we hope will mark the beginning of a process whose goal is general and complete disarmament and the allocation of the resources thus released to development action. The world cannot continue to spend many hundreds of billions of dollars on the arms race while a tiny fraction of that sum could help to eliminate poverty from out planet. In other words  disarmament should mean not only the reduction of arras and armed forces  but also the reduction of the sums spent on them. The international community must also intensify its efforts to bring about the limitation  reduction and elimination of weapons in order to focus all its economic strength and its technological skill at the development of Member States and international co-operation among all the nations of the world. For as long as three quarters of mankind is confronting an acute development crisis we shall continue to insist on the c elation ship between disarmament and development.The economic and social situation has not improved in most developing countries. The economies of the countries concerned  in particular the economies of the African countries  have experienced negative growth in real terms. With a foreign debt which amounts to some 3230 billion  Africa can have no successful economic recovery on development programme unless that debt burden is lightened.In this connection we welcome the initiatives of certain developed countries in cancelling part of the debt of some African countries. Those realistic and constructive initiatives aimed at reducing the volume of debt ate certainly part of the search for a way out of the crisis  but they are not sufficient because they do not constitute a final solution to the problem of indebtedness. They must be strengthened by the relevant suggestions contained in the common African position on the debt crisis.A definitive settlement of Africa's foreign debt crisis requires energetic  bold decisions in the framework of a strategy based on co-operation  negotiation and shared responsibility. It was in order to give effect to such a strategy that Africa proposed to the international community the convening of an international conference on the African debt. It is clear that the debt crisis is hindering the development of Africa and constitutes the main factor impeding the recovery of economic growth. According to the Economic Commission for Africa  the overall economic growth of the continent averaged 1.4 per cent between 1986 and 1989 and population growth was approximately 3 per cent in that period. That means that per capita income in 1988 was 5 per cent lower than in 1985.It is noteworthy that the agricultural sector  which constitutes the driving force of roost of Africa's economies  is in a state of serious stagnation  if not disquieting regression  because of the effects of climate disturbances and profound ecological deterioration  such as desertification  but also because of the brutal fall in the prices of agricultural commodities. The industrial sector  far from serving as a financial and material support for agriculture  absorbs an increasingly large share of the meagre resources available  to finance the necessary but very costly imports needed for production.Because of this  African countries did not benefit from the economic recovery that occurred in the industrialized countries in 1988. The demand for and prices of commodities continued to decline at the same time. Furthermore  the foreign debt situation worsened and the flow of resources towards Africa decreased greatly  making the continent a net exporter of capital.In addition to recovery programmes adopted by the continent to tackle the situation - for example  the Priority Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa  adopted in 1985  and the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  adopted in 1986 - over 30 African countries  among than my own  have undertaken  with the support of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  processes of stabilization and structural adjustment. The objective of the structural adjustment programmes is to restore in the short term the basic macro-economic balance. Those programmes have a negative impact on economic growth and on the standard of living of the population. In order to mitigate the shortcomings of those structural adjustment models  the 25th summit conference of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  held in Addis Ababa last July  adopted an African frame of reference for structural adjustment programmes that takes into account the long-term development objectives and strategies at the national  sub regional and regional levels.My delegation hopes that the international community will grasp the relevance of the African formula and promote the adoption of those innovative and well-adapted principles in the approaches taken by international economic and financial institutions that play an essential role in preserving the economic health of the world. Africa is aware that it bears the primary responsibility for its own development. Accordingly  it has made all the sacrifices that the circumstances demand. Africa has committed itself to huge policies of economic reform which will have an impact on the economic and social sectors of public life. The most sensitive social sectors such as education and health  have already been affected greatly. The African States have agreed to accept the resulting political risks because they ate convinced that  at the end of the process  there will be an improvement in the standards of living of their peoples.The struggle that we are waging today must certainly have as its goal the total development of the individual and harmony in society. It must guarantee social justice  equity and solidarity. In particular  it must lay the foundations that will ensure the survival and development of the child - that fragile sector of our population which is particularly vulnerable to the deterioration of economic conditions. This is why my country is making an urgent appeal to the international community for the prompt convening of a global summit on childhood. It would indeed be regrettable if the profound sacrifices made by the present generation. to assure for its successors a more human and move viable heritage were not to guarantee the survival  protection and development of the child. The adoption of an international convention on the rights of the child would make it possible to improve the conditions of children throughout the world  particularly in the developing countries.An international conference on the environment will be held in Kali in a few months  with the support and participation of United Nations specialized agencies. The problem of the deterioration of the environment is multidimensional and is particularly difficult to resolve in our countries. Furthermore  the structural rigidity of underdeveloped economies compounds the many factors that cause the deterioration of our fragile ecosystems. By promoting development that is ecologically rational  the United Nations system and the entire international community are demonstrating a commendable awareness of the grave danger that human needs and the vicissitudes of climate pose to the ecological balance of our world. The logical consequence of this awareness is that any approach to ecologically rational development must deal with the disturbing problem of toxic waste. At the Basle Conference Africa shared its own concerns and expressed reservations about codifying transport or movement of toxic wastes. The international community cannot remain indifferent to this allâimportant question that faces the continent  already so deeply affected by the fragility of its ecosystem and the destructive effects of the global economic crisis.In conclusion  may I say that it is comforting and encouraging to note that at the dawn of the third millennium the world is experiencing profound changes. However  these changes can be meaningful only if they are accompanied by a collective awareness of the shared destiny of everyone of the planet. The value of these changes depends on the establishment of a new  more just  more equitable and more democratic political  economic  social and cultural order in the world. By meeting the great challenges  by remaining united  our nations and our peoples will honour their commitments undertaken in the United Nations - commitments which  under the Charter  we are duty-bound to strengthen. Thus  we will work to bring together individuals and peoples whose legitimate aspiration is to live  in harmony  in a world of peace  freedom  justice and social progress. I reaffirm the commitment of the people of Mali  of the Democratic Union of Mali and of the Mali Government - in particular. President Moussa Traore - to work tirelessly towards the attainment of these noble deals of the United Nations."
"93",4661,"MLT",44,1989,"ï»¿Happily  the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization provided more than one occasion for a smile of contentment to relieve the more usual grin with clenched teeth induced by realistic surveys of world affairs. Two of these pleasing if small occasions were his congratulating us on a deflationary trend in our rhetoric and on a growth of civility in our exchanges. The proffering of our congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency  and of thanks to your predecessor  as well as to the Secretary-General himself  is part of due courtesy  not of vain rhetoric. Indeed it is possible  as in this case  to make ritual gestures with the greatest sincerity.The Secretary-General's report allowed us to note  with very great satisfaction  that the performance of the United Nations has improved in substance as well as in form. I do not intend to rehearse either the range of successes achieved or the persistent doldrums afflicting us. I would merely echo the sentiments already expressed by others. In this regard I will echo a statement made here by my predecessor  Mr. George Borg-Olivier  the first Prime Minister of independent Malta - an independence which was achieved only 25 years ago  despite our existence as a nation for thousands of years.The most critical role in the transformation of the international cacophony of the past into a joyous future symphony appertains to the super-Powers  but no orchestra generally functions satisfactorily if it is made up only of trombones and timpani. Some part is usually played by a flute or a piccolo. If the voice of a micro-State such as ours does have any special claim to be heard in this assembly  it is certainly not because we include ourselves that smallness of size or antiquity of national origin dowers us with some sort of superior Olympian wisdom. It is rather that our mini-stature does tend to make our self-interest more nearly coincide with the global interest. A diminutive physique does not go as a rule with an enormous appetite for self-aggrandizement but rather with a point of view that is singularly alert to the prospects and problems of the survival of all in a danger-filled environment. It is very precisely in that perspective that I speak here today.Let me explain what has prompted me to begin with this reminder. Of the specific issues with which my country has mostly keenly involved itself - from the care of the elderly to the need to curtail the traffic in armaments - from the very first years of our presence here  there is probably none with which the name of Malta has come to be more intimately associated than that of the common management of extraterritorial spaces.I am using this term deliberately. I am doing so because unfortunately the concept which we introduced and which has been incorporated as a foundation-stone in the law of the sea Convention and used in many other United Nations-sponsored treaties  charters  declarations and other juridical and policy instruments - the common heritage of mankind - continues to be misunderstood. It is not however misunderstood by the Secretary-General  and its essence is very accurately captured in the phrase he uses in his report where he refers to ""common management ... reflecting a community of interest among Member States"".Precisely this identification of ""a community of interest* among all nations  developing and developed - for the benefit of all  rich as well as poor  whatever the nature of their ideology as well as their geography - was the motive force that moved us.The areas of coincidence between the interests of all categories of States were our target. Ours was not a move in a rush or onset by the hungry to gobble down sundry goods spread out on somebody else's table. On the contrary our starting point was the existence of goods which had two characteristics: in the first place  they were not on anybody's table; they lay still unexplored and un-exploited beyond the limits of national jurisdiction? they were the resources of extraterritorial spaces; and  secondly  their nature and location implied that they could not be rationally managed on the basis of legal regimes conceived in terms of the conventional notions of ""property"" and of ""sovereignty"" with the absolutist connotations they have acquired in the modern age.Our idea was that the common heritage of mankind should not be considered as the property of  or as subject to  the sovereignty of anybody - not of the United Nations any more than of any individual country  not of the human collectivity any more than of any smaller human entity  not at any rate in any sense in which the owner or the sovereign can do with it as it pleases him.Quite different and novel rules of management had to be devised. The Law of the Sea constitutes of course a major  however imperfect  step in that direction. It contains recognition that the vastness of extraterritorial space is not so unlimited that human activity cannot cause irreparable damage to it. Even more serious dangers lurk in other extraterritorial spaces where the measures so far taken have been more fragmentary. Consequently I am urging the Assembly to take a fresh look at the whole matter not in the conceptual framework of the debates about property and sovereignty which were comprehensible in the world of the past but in the new situation produced by the development of man's scientific and technological activities. What is at stake is not at all competition between East and West  or even primarily between North and South  but the victory of order over chaos  of survival over planetary destruction.My Government is convinced that there can be no true development without an environment which will permit mankind to live a life of dignity and well-being.Furthermore  new technologies  population growth and the human urge to develop have brought about new  serious threats to the delicate ecological balance of our globe. Indeed we believe that certain of these threats risk causing irreparable damage  thereby endangering the very existence of life on Garth*Urgent action is needed to save our planet. The new environmental problems call for innovative solutions to be devised. That is why we actively supported the initiative taken by Prance  the Netherlands and Norway  which led to the Hague Declaration on the atmosphere and climate change  signed last March.Malta is raising its environmental concerns in every forum. It will be recalled that Malta's initiative to protect the global climate led to resolution 43/53  which was unanimously adopted  entitled ""Protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind""  which characterized climate change as the common concern of mankind.The resolution sets out what is essentially a plan of action to counter the growing problem of adverse climate change. We are satisfied with the progress which is being made in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  established by the world Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme. We are convinced that if any proposed remedies are to be effected they have to take into account the economies of developing States.Those States which have already developed and polluted cannot now expect other States to stultify their own growth. This has to be the basis of any international convention on climate  if it is to enjoy widespread and general acceptance.Malta has also actively participated in the Commonwealth Group of Experts on Climate Change  and it looks forward to the outcome of the discussion of the subject at the October meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government  to be held in Malaysia.A new proposal which we are putting forward for active consideration at this forty-fourth session  and which I am pleased to announce has been accepted by the Assembly's General Committee  as agenda item 82 (j)  is the protection of the environment of extraterritorial spaces. In this respect we are suggesting thatas a first step a group of eminent parsons be invited to prepare a study  possibly in time for consideration at the 1992 United Nations conference on environment and development.The group's first effort could be an attempt to identify and specify the extraterritorial spaces and to examine which human activities are causing unreasonable damage to the environmental integrity of such spaces. Clearly  its task will be formidable  for  while it is important not to regulate too late  it is not desirable to seek to regulate non-existent activities. Likewise  it may avoid unnecessary complexity by not seeking to tackle the common heritage as a whole  but restricting the immediate area of attention to extraterritorial spaces. Besides the high seas and the international sea-bed area  the super adjacent airspace  certain parts of the atmosphere and outer space  as well as such other more controversial areas as may be determined  will have to be evaluated from the point of view of their environmental state.Recommendations could then be made regarding the rights and duties of States and of the international community and the revised or new legal instruments needed  at least for catastrophe avoidance. The group's report could serve at least as a preliminary basis on which our thinking could be realistically built in view of the new global requirements of present and future generations.So far I have been seeking to take account of the fact that it is not only the problems of ocean space"" that are closely interrelated and need to be considered as a whole""  as the preamble to the Convention on the Law of the Sea says. It is all the parts of our small planet  which are closely bound together in a single web.Nevertheless  the Convention and its sober consolidation open up the possibility of turning ocean space into a real laboratory in the service of true development  with respect for the environment  which could be exemplary for other areas and  indeed  a foundation for the whole. For that reason  I wish to develop further the two main suggestions which I made in this regard when I last had the privilege of addressing the General Assembly  and to clarify the essential thrust of both. Their common pivot is the need to associate  in the governance of the institutions suited for ocean affairs and their analogues in other multiple-use domains  representatives of the whole cast of very varied actors who operate in the sea  instead of merely the representatives of States.Consequently  my first suggestion was the establishment of a global forum on ocean affairs  where the representatives of States could meet and interact with those of all the specialized agencies of the United Nations system and of other intergovernmental and non-governmental  scientific  commercial  environmental and other organizations with an active and participative stake in the management of ocean affairs in an integrated manner.My second suggestion  also intended to facilitate the bringing into play of the potentialities of network building  was the systematic strengthening of regional institutions as an intermediate level  meshing the national and the global.Several notable efforts have been made  and are still being made  in that direction by the United Nations and its agencies. But there is still a central void - that of means by which all the key actors in a sphere of activities can be brought together. Unfortunately  the all-too-often un-harmonized operations of the different parts of national Governments themselves in the marine sphere are at presentreflected at the international level  and  for instance  the establishment of large exclusive economic zones in terms of the law of the sea Convention requires integrated management systems  which it is difficult to set up by the unaided efforts of many an individual State.The extension of national jurisdiction necessitates more  not less  international co-operation. Indeed  there are many articles in the Convention itself which prescribe co-operation with coastal States by the competent international authorities - meaning  in most cases  United Nations agencies.My suggestion in this regard is  therefore  that regional commissions for ocean affairs be set up. They should have a very mixed membership. There should not be meetings of representatives only of ministries of foreign affairs  or only of environment or transport ministries  or only of international organizations  or other entities of one kind only. All of the following should be there: the national focal points or other co-ordinating centres of national marine activities  if they exist  as they should; the regional officers of the specialized United Nations agencies; and other bodies  both intergovernmental and governmental.Moreover  the commissions should directly involve at all stages of their work the major ocean users from all countries affected by regional decisions. Experience has shown that the contributions of the actual users of resources usually prove extremely valuable to prevent political obstacles from blocking the progress of regional planning  or to circumvent them. The characteristic input of actual users is to anticipate such problems before they become frustrating and to devise procedures for their avoidance. Their participation is vital to the commissions' fulfilment of their role. That role is essentially one of rationalization. Consequently  the cost should not be heavy  No new large bureaucracies are needed  because all of the elements of the system are already in existence. There is only a need for them to be catalysed.I have dwelt on this point at some length not merely for its own sake hut also as an illustration of the new style of international governance that seems to be called for at the present juncture in world affairs. Similar organizational models can be envisaged in other spheres of activity  such as labour relations. The international Labour Organisation (ILO) is  of course  a very striking instance of an early structure involving State and non-state organizations as an essential aspect of the functioning of its system.A fundamental point of thrust for the regional commissions for ocean affairs should be the development of technological capability. It is clearly in the fields of scientific research and technological capability that investment by funding agencies  national and international  is most inadequate and yet  over the years  most likely to yield the most enduring contribution to human betterment.Two years ago I mentioned here that in fulfilment of articles 276 and 277 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Malta had proposed the setting up of a Mediterranean regional centre for the development of marine technology. We envisaged that through it enterprises  both public and private  and organizations  both national and international  would be involved in the financing of projects judged to be of general benefit. We also expected that it would be a pilot undertaking to be followed in other regions  one reciprocally beneficial to both the developed and the developing countries of the region.I am happy to report that with the direct support of the Secretary-General and his excellent collaborators the proposal has been pursued  especially through theUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)  and that it has found the support of several Mediterranean countries. I would like to stress again that  far from seeking to rival or compete with any other existing institutions  particularly European ones  the centre would complement and enhance their activities with advantages to all. I am therefore confident that the centre will emerge as a model of North-South - and particularly of Euro-African- Asian - co-operation in the one area of the world where the three continents meet around the ""Middle Sea""  at the very centre of which my country is placed.I have  as I said I would at the beginning  concentrated on only a few topics so that they stand out in a sharper focus. To some extent this is more possible today because the atmosphere in international relations is improving so much that we have an opportunity co take a broader look and to identify other global dangers  in particular those that threaten the environment and the economic system.That does not mean that we are insensitive to a number of disputes that linger on  defying solution and spreading misery to the peoples involved. Many speakers more directly involved in those questions have drawn our attention to their plight. The greatest service we can do for those people is to act  each of us as best we can  so as to encourage real dialogue and so as not to aid and abet those who feel that force or intransigence pay better dividends.Casting a glance at our region  we feel disappointed that the hopes we had entertained about a solution to the Cyprus problem have received a setback. As an island State in the Mediterranean we cannot but be concerned about the situation in Cyprus  one which  despite the efforts of the Secretary-General and the goodwill the Government of Cyprus has shown  does not seem to be improving as we had all hoped a year ago. We make a strong appeal to all parties directly or indirectly concerned not to miss any opportunity to bring to an end a tragedy that has not brought any benefit to those who sought  rather mistakenly  to find a solution to their problems through division. If we all  without exception  send a cleat message that we do not countenance division in that island nation  the parties directly concerned will not fail to extend the hand of co-operation to the Secretary-General and to each other.The tragedy of Lebanon is a blot on our civilization and on our times. I had occasion to speak in strong terms on this conflict earlier this month at the summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at Belgrade. Since then a ray of hope has appeared with the acceptance of the Arab League initiative. Let us not be lulled into any false complacency. The peoples and Governments of the area have beat presented with an opportunity  but far more strenuous efforts are required to translate that opportunity into a genuine and lasting peace.A genuine peace in the area can be lasting only when all the peoples living there can exercise their sovereignty in full freedom within accepted and secure borders - and the peoples of the area include the peoples of Israel and Palestine. We encourage the Secretary-General and all others who have taken positive initiatives to persevere in their efforts to bring the day of peace and justice in the area much nearer. The world has been impressed by the responsible and positive attitude taken by the representatives of the Palestinian people to realize their inalienable rights through a political solution  as repeatedly expressed in the United Nations. Their outstretched hand should not be ignored. The peace of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples  and peace in the entire region and perhaps even in the entire world  demands a reciprocal move from the other side. We commend and support all constructive efforts being made to assist the process  and we wish to express our appreciation for the leadership exercised by President Mubarak in this regard.In the other almost traditional areas of conflict that are reflected in our deliberations we have seen over the past year significant  though perhaps hesitant  steps forward. The promise of a solution is there in Central America  in the Sahara  in Namibia  in the Gulf  in Afghanistan and in South-East Asia. Having come this far  why should we betray the hopes of our peoples? Dare we hope that even in South Africa apartheid will be seen by all for the evil that it is and that it will be replaced by a system that gives due dignity to man and woman irrespective of colour or race? The aspiration to realize the unity and solidarity of the human race is precisely what inspired the concrete proposals Malta put forward about the common heritage and common concerns of mankind in the oceans  the atmosphere and other extraterritorial spaces. That aspiration is to be pursued not only in political forums  such as the Assembly  but throughout the educational systems of all countries. We are pleased that the new International Maritime Law Institute in Malta  constituted and run by the International Maritime Organization (IMO)  is to start receiving students from developing countries this October. It will undoubtedly increase the skills of those who are committed to the search for international solutions that go against the interest of no State but that serve to enhance the common good of all the members of the human race."
"94",4707,"MMR",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Union of Myanmar and on my own behalf  I take pleasure in extending warmest congratulations to the President on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. His election to this high office reflects the confidence of all the States Members of the United Nations in his demonstrated diplomatic skills and leadership qualities  as well as in his commitment to the ideals of the Organization. It is also a fitting tribute to the great country he represents  the Federal al Republic of Nigeria  which has always been in the forefront in the quest for peace and security in the fight against colonialism and racial discrimination and in the promotion of economic and social justice in the world. Let me assure him that in discharging his heavy responsibilities he can count on the full support and co-operation of my delegation.I wish also to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Dente Caputo of Argentina  for his valuable contribution to the success of the Assembly at its forty-third session. The current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of great expectations. In the past year we have witnessed a continuation and farther consolidation of the positive and encouraging trends in international relations that have rekindled hopes for a better world.As a result of these new trends the United Nations has regained much of its relevance  and the role of the Security Council as an instrument of International peace and security has been revitalized. Nat only Governments  but millions of common people around the globe are beginning to feel that the trust they had continued to place in the Organization during its time of trials and tribulations has been vindicated. Nations large and small are demonstrating more willingness to co-operate and to work within the framework of the Organization. As a result  we are witnessing a far greater inclination on the part of nations to rely on the United Nations peace-keeping operations than to resort to unilateral action. Here  I wish to pay a special tribute to the men and women from different lands who  often at great personal peril  are keeping the peace in many troubled parts of the world under the United Nations banner. Many of those emissaries of peace have been the victims of terrorism. At this juncture  the effectiveness of the united Nations would surely be enhanced further if all States that qualify for membership in conformity with the provisions of the Charter were admitted to the Organization. We therefore welcome the desire expressed by the Republic of Korea to become a Member of the United Nations  while not losing sight of the need for the ultimate reunification of Korea.The enhanced prestige and renewed credibility of the United Nations are attributable not only to the marked improvement in international relations but also in large measure to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  to enhance the effectiveness of the Organization.Even during its darkest days he never despaired or wavered. Instead  with a single-minded dedication and an unflinching faith in the essential soundness of the idea of the united Nations  and ably assisted by his senior advisers and a corps of dedicated international civil servants  he ably defended everything the United Nations stood for Ä On behalf of the Government of the Union of Myanmar  I should like to place on record out sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for a very difficult job very well done.The perceptible improvement in the international climate  particularly in the pattern of the relationship between the two super-Powers  is having a favourable impact on the solution of a variety of long-standing problems bearing on the maintenance of international peace and security. Nowhere is that impact felt more profoundly than in the field of arms control and disarmament.The conclusion of the Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - and its effective implementation in good faith by both parties  which has resulted in the destruction of over half their stockpiles  have generated greater mutual confidence between them. That is bound to provide a stranger impetus to bilateral and multilateral negotiations on disarmament  issue of vital importance for the survival of mankind. That impetus has already led to the resumption in June 1969 of the strategic arms reduction talks - START - with the stated goal of a 50 per cent reduction. A successful conclusion of these negotiations would bring about a qualitative change in the power relationship between the two major military alliances and set the disarmament process well on course. It would also usher in a new era of enhanced international peace and security and thus be a historic achievement of Immense significance for the future of mankind.While the conclusion of the IMF Treaty and the prospective reductions in offensive strategic weapons are indeed laudable  it bears repeating that the elimination of all nuclear weapons must remain the ultimate goal of mankind. In this connection we welcome the convergent view of both super-Powers that nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We welcome this as an expression of their political will to halt and reverse the nuclear-arms race. The first necessary step to that end Is the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty.In the field of chemical weapons  the Paris Conference held in January 1989 expressed with one voice the collective will of the international community to see a world totally free from these inhuman weapons. Following years of seemingly irreconcilable differences on the principal issues involved  particularly the question of verification  significant forward movement was made this year when the Soviet Ð¨1Ð¾Ð¿ and the United States reached agreement on key elements of a treaty banning those weapons.The memorandum of understanding between them on chemical weapons  signed on 23 September and providing for verification and data exchange  represents further progress towards that goal. We have been further heartened by the important concrete proposals announced by the President of the united States in the Assembly on 25 September and by the positive response given to the proposals by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union on the following day. Timely action to eliminate the world's two largest chemical-weapon arsenals could serve as an effective bar to the spread of chemical weapons. It is therefore imperative that these bilateral efforts be redoubled in order that multilateral negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament can move forward expeditiously and a universal convention on the total prohibition of these weapons be concluded at an early date.The past year has been particularly remarkable for the United Nations as the focus of action in the search for the peaceful settlement of regional disputes and conflicts. However  the degree of success attending these efforts has varied. We ate happy to note that  thanks to the decisive action of the Security Council  id the unremitting efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative  the settlement plan for Namibia embodied in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has progressed to a stage where we can look forward to the emergence of that Territory as an independent sovereign State  lb ensure Namibia's transition to independence  we urge all countries concerned  particularly South Africa  to fulfil in good faith the obligations they have assumed under the relevant agreements and understandings. The attainment of statehood by Namibia will bring to an end the last vestiges of colonialism in Africa.Nevertheless  the rebirth of that great continent cannot be considered complete so long as millions of black South Africans remain virtually enslaved in the land of their ancestors under the oppressive and evil regime of apartheid. Recent developments in South Africa seem to have opened a window of opportunity for the minority regime in that country to institute fundamental and meaningful reforms aimed at terminating that obnoxious system at an early date. We earnestly hope the regime will seize this opportunity to introduce such reforms urgently. At this critical juncture  the international community should exert greater pressure  including the enforcement of economic sanctions  on the South African authorities with a view to attaining the objective of racial equality and majority rule in that country on the basis of universal suffrage. At the same time  encouragement should be given to the rising tide of liberal white opinion in South Africa in favour of fundamental change  which was clearly evident in the recent elections.One region where peace initiatives from within the region itself are bearing fruit is Central America. The continuing efforts of the Presidents of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua to achieve the goals of peace and democratization they had earlier set for themselves in the Esquipulas II agreements and mote recently in the Tela agreement have brought the termination of a decade of turmoil in the region within sight. We believe these regional initiatives deserve the positive support of extra-regional Powers.In the Middle East  despite some positive developments  represented by the Palestine National Council's acceptance of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute continues to elude us. The question of Palestine  which is at the core of the Middle East conflict  remains unresolved. No tangible progress has been achieved  end the formidable obstacles to the peace process persist. We believe the time has arrived for the parties involved to make their utmost efforts to bring about an enduring peace in the region in conformity with the terms set forth in the sand Security Council resolutions. Those resolutions provide the only workable basis for a lasting peace in the region  and any attempt to call their validity into question is fraught with incalculable dangers. My delegation supports the proposal that an international peace conference on the Middle East be held under United Nations auspices  with the participation of all parties concerned on an equal footing. Here  we would like to reiterate our unwavering support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people in Palestine  including their right to national independence and sovereignty. We would also like to take this opportunity to express the hops that the continuing constructive efforts of President Mubarak of Egypt would facilitate our search for peace in that region. In the mean time urgent steps should be taken to ensure that General Assembly resolution 43/233 of 26 April 1939 be strictly observed and that  in conformity with its terms  necessary measures be taken to provide protection to the Palestinian civilians in the occupied Arab territories.In Lebanon 14 years of hostilities have brought untold suffering to its people destroyed its economy  rent its communities and State institutions in shambles. Given the nature of the conflict  a solution of the crisis will require concerned international efforts. My delegation therefore welcomes the laudable efforts of the Heads of State of Algeria# Morocco and Saudi Arabia to end the bloodshed  to re-establish peace in the country and to safeguard its unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence.Coming nearer home  we believe that every avenue must continue to be explored in order to put an end to the protracted strife and misery in neighbouring Kampuchea. We are greatly distressed that the quest for a peaceful solution  which began in earnest with the Jakarta Informal Meetings in July 1988 and February 1989  and which was intensified at the International Conference held in Paris in the summer of this year  has not achieved the desire result. The continuing aim of the international community must remain the working out  on the basis of the gains already made  of a compressive political solution that would ensure respect for Kampuchean sovereignty  Independence and territorial integrity and for the neutral end non-aligned status of Kampuchea  as well as for the right of the Kampuchean people to self-determination free from outside interference.In the quest for such a solution the interests of the Kampuchean people must be held paramount. Noone should aim for anything less  and no one should seek anything more. The total withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces last month is an important and necessary first step towards achieving a settlement of the Kampuchean problem in all its interlocking internal and external aspects. Given the deep mistrust and bitterness generated by 11 years of foreign military intervention  it is imperative that all stages and aspects of the implementation of any settlement plan for Kampuchea be carried out under the supervision and control of an appropriate international median ism.We find it distressing the emergent spirit of co-operation in the political field has not yet spread to the sphere of international economic relations. As the secretary-general pointed out in his annual report on the work of the Organization for the current year  the progress we have achieved in the global political climate can prove precarious if the economic climate remains adverse for the majority of the world's population   (A/44/1  p  19)The efforts of the developing countries to bring about a new International economic order that would be more equitable and more supportive of their development processes has to date been largely unsuccessful. The present international economic environment remains non-conducive to the aspirations of the developing countries. Instead  those countries  Including my own  are faced with problems of mounting debt  inadequate flow of external assistance and falling commodity prices that have resulted in a sharp decline in their terms of trade. For many developing countries the overriding concern continues to be the impediment to development posed by external indebtedness. Although important guidelines for dealing with the debt problem have been land down by the international community  a solution remains elusive. The gravity of the situation is Illustrated by the net outward transfer of resources from debtor developing countries to their creditors  which  according to the United Nations World Economic Survey  1989  grew to a staggering $32 5 billion in 1988. The solution of the external debt problem of the developing countries must remain a major concern on the international agenda. A formula for dealing effectively with that problem needs to be worked out through continuous multilateral dialogue and the shared responsibility of all. Past experience has amply demonstrated that the  market menu approach  and its variants ace incapable of addressing the core of the problem. The search for an innovative international debt strategy should therefore be intensified. In this connection we consider that ideas that have been advanced for the creation of an international debt facility management one such approach and that the mechanics of such a facility should be given serious thought.The least developed countries have been and are being hardest hit by those unfavourable developments. The over-all socio-economic conditions of those countries have deteriorated in spite of the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the Least Developed Countries adopted in 1981 with a view to improving their condition. That Programme remains the main framework for concerted international action for the economic and social uplift the least developed countries  and its successful implementation is of vital importance for those countries. Here  the delegation of Myanmar would like to reiterate the importance of the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held at Paris in 1990 and of the preparatory meetings leading to that Conference.My delegation considers that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in the spring of 1990 would provide a significant opportunity to conduct purposeful multilateral dialogue on the issues besetting the global economy and on the means of redressing them on a long-term basis. We hope that it would revitalize the North-South dialogue and that it would take into account the special needs and circumstances of the developing countries  particularly of the least developed among them. Moreover  the elaboration of an international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade that is now in hand will give a far greater sense of purpose and direction to International co-operation for development than hitherto.The developing countries are fully aware that the responsibility for the development of their national economies rests primarily with themselves. Many of them are undertaking the daunting task of extremely difficult but necessary adjustment programmes. They also recognize that effective national policies are important in attracting financial flows and new equity investments and in creating a climate for sustained development.	'While en this subject  I wish to touch on my country's endeavour in this regard  in my country we are undertaking economic reform measures and have carried out restructuring in selected areas of the economy. Accordingly  we have adopted an open-door economic policy and have under taken internal and external trade-liberalization measures in line with the country's socio-political conditions. In order to inject new dynamism into the performance of the export trade  there is now an increased reliance and special importance placed on the market mechanism. One of the most significant forces of the general liberalization measures is the increasingly important role expected to be played by the private sector in such fields as production  services and trade. Moreover  a foreign investment law  as promulgated in 1988 with a view to attracting greater flow of foreign capital investment. The aim of that law is to alleviate the capital constraint faced by Myanmar.important as national policies are  the development of the developing countries would be difficult to bring about without a supportive international economic environment. A more open and improved international trading system would be of great benefit to the developing countries.A great number of developing countries  including the least developed among them  are falling behind because of their inability to move out of traditional economic pursuits  namely  the production and export of primary products  the market for which has in the main been either depressed or unpredictable.It is of vital importance to these countries that they diversify their exports. However  their attempts at diversification have to be made in the face of a growing tendency towards protectionism.Foremost among the social concerns of the international community is the increasing threat posed to mankind by narcotic drugs. In recent years it has become particularly clear that drug abuse rends the fabric of societies and ruins the lives of individuals  not the least among them being the youth of our nations. What is urgently required  therefore  is to attack the problem in its totality  f t am cultivation and transportation across international frontiers to consumption and drug money laundering. In this connection  we in the Union of are fully doing our share by all means open to us. We have long been relentlessly waging a determined war against the menace of narcotic drugs as a matter of national responsibility.We have land down comprehensive schemes to combat the drug menace and are energetically implementing them. The comprehensive programme which we have land dawn covers the whole gamut of drug-control activities  such as law enforcement  crop substitution  livestock breeding  medical treatment  rehabilitation  education and mass-media information. We have recently launched an integrated rural development programme with particular emphasis on infrastructural building  crop substitution and overall alleviation of socio-economic conditions. We believe that the successful implementation of the programme will accelerate the eradication of opium cultivation. In close co-operation with the United Nations  resolute action is being taken in all these fields. In recognition of the efforts of the Myanmar authorities  the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control has authorized an additional sum of $O.5 million in assistance. In the Union of Myanmar an elaborate legal basis is already in place to fight illicit drugs. In 1974 and 1983 the Government strengthened its drug-control laws banning the cultivation of narcotic plants and increasing penalties for illicit drug trafficking. The law prohibits cultivation of any and all crops from which narcotic drugs can be processed. It also provides for the destruction of narcotic crops and confiscation of equipment used in the production of these drugs.In parallel with the foregoing measures  large-scale military operations are being carried out against drug traffickers and their production camps. The Myanmar security forces to date have not only destroyed 200 000 acres of cultivated opium  but have on innumerable occasions interdicted heavily armed opium caravans transporting the produce to transit points in the border regions. The amount of heroin seized as a result of the Government's campaign totals 100 000 kilogrammes. The magnitude of the task accomplished can be judged from the fact that the opium poppy is cultivated in remote regions of the country which are accessible only on foot or by helicopter  and the opium trails pass throughÂ· densely wooded and tugged terrain.These successful campaigns have been carried out with great sacrifice on the part of our security forces. In the course of these campaigns well over 100 members of the Myanmar security forces have lost their lives and close to 550 have been wounded.The significant achievements of our drug-suppression campaigns have earned high praise in foreign Government quarters  including the United States Drug Enforcement Agency. Despite this  certain quarters have chosen to ignore the strenuous efforts made by Myanmar and seen fit to level unfounded allegations against us. Some have gone so far as to accuse the Myanmar security forces of collaborating with the drug traffickers. Such accusations have deeply pained us. I would remind those who level these malicious charges against us that the ill-gotten proceeds from drug trafficking constitute the very life blood of the various groups that are waging an armed insurgency against the Myanmar State.Earlier in my statement I paid fitting tribute to the men and women from different lands who are serving as guardians of the peace under the (United Nations banner. Members of the Myanmar security forces engaged in a relentless war against drug traffickers may not be wearing blue helmets  but the cause for which hundreds of them have sacrificed life and limb is no less internationalist and no less worthy.In addressing the Assembly on 26 September in his capacity as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community (EEC)  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French Republic made an appeal that the Myanmar people be allowed freely to exercise their right of expression  d that democracy be restored in the country through the organization of free elections. Furthermore  speaking on the following day the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom stated that there was an urgent need for restoration of human rights and democracy in Myanmar through free elections. I should like to assure them - indeed  the entire world - that that is precisely the objective for the attainment of which the Myanmar Government is exerting sincere arid unremitting efforts.It is known to all that the people of Myanmar have manifested their genuine desire for and aspirations to a multiparty democracy and political reforms. The Myanmar Government has responded positively to those aspirations. It has instituted a number of far-reaching fundamental reforms and is actively carrying out a series of measures to fulfil the aspirations of the people. We have abolished the single-party political system and in its place have adopted a multiparty democratic sys ten. Purposeful measures have been put in train to bring about a smooth transition to the new system.An independent multiparty democracy general elections commission composed of five retired  widely respected elder citizens was constituted in September 1988  The commission has been performing its assigned tasks since then. Two of the members ace Buddhists  two profess the Muslim faith  and one is a Christian belonging to the Kayin national race.A political parties registration law was promulgated on 27 September of last year. Ito date more than 200 political parties have been registered with the elections commission.On 16 February 1989 the commission announced a fixed timetable setting out in detail the various preparatory measures to be undertaken by it prior to the holding of multiparty democratic elections not later than May 1990. The respective time frames for the completion of these various measures were also specified in the timetable.After soliciting and taking account of the views of political parties and the general public  an electoral law was promulgated on 31 May this year. Subsequently  on 30 June  election rules were promulgated. Nationwide electoral rolls are being prepared expeditiously  and other related measures necessary for holding free and fair elections are being carried out.To put it in a nutshell  the implementation of the programme and timetable for holding elections is proceeding well and on schedule. The momentum will be carried forward and intensified in the remaining months before the elections.Peaceful political activity within the law is being permitted  and political parties are vigorously carrying out their organizational work throughout the length and breadth of the country. In order to safeguard and consolidate the much-improved stability in the country  certain necessary restrictions have perforce to be imposed for the time being on public political campaigning. Those restrictions will be gradually relaxed as election day approaches. At the same time  the Government is laying a sound foundation for democracy. An independent judiciary  with the Supreme Court at its apex  has been re-established. The functions of the Attorney-General have been institutionalized. These institutions  indispensable to a democratic State  have been functioning normally since September last year.Moreover  the civil service has been depoliticized and is being reformed into a body of men and women of high professional competence and integrity  dedicated solely to the service of the country. A mass-media campaign has been launched to instil in the general public the true values of democracy  such as respect for the law  respect for the rights of fellow citizens  and appreciation of the obligations that those rights entail.I have highlighted some of the measures that are being conscientiously carried out by the Myanmar Government with a view to creating conditions conducive to the successful holding of free and fair elections. Assurances have been repeatedly given at the highest level that these elections will be held without fail  and as scheduled  not later than May 1990. I am authorized to reaffirm this commitment before the Assembly and  through it  to the world.Here I need hardly mention that this national undertaking can be realized only in conditions where the rule of law and civil order prevail. It is a task to be pursued in a peaceful  systematic and orderly manner  in observance of the true values of democracy. This can be accomplished only by the people of Myanmar themselves. At this critical juncture no outside Power should attempt to prescribe for Myanmar what is best for it or what form its political future should assume. Attempts to channel future events in Myanmar in directions of one's own liking and according to one's own perceptions - instances of which we have  regrettably witnessed in Myanmar recently - not only violate the fundamental principles of the Charter but would prove ultimately self-defeating.In this regard  I can do no better than quote the wise words of the Secretary-General  who in his latest report on the work of the Organisation saysÂ·. At this critical stage  the mandatory principle of non-intervention by States in one another's internal affairs acquires added importance. ... No State can  of course  insulate itself completely from the currents of information and opinion flowing in the world  but ultimately each national society must find its own equilibrium in accordance with its own values. Considering the web of memories  perceptions  aspirations and cultural values that constitute national life  any forceful pressures from outside to give it a particular form can hold little constructive promise in the long run. More often than not  they provoke a reaction different from the one desired.  (A/44/1  pp. 18 and 19)"
"95",4764,"MNG",44,1989,"ï»¿First of all let me congratulate Mr. Joseph Garba on his election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. We wish him great success in carrying out his important duties. We join with previous speakers who have expressed their gratitude to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for his skilful guidance of the work of the last session.The United Nations  as a universal instrument for the maintenance of a secure world order  vividly reflects the changes in the political climate of the world. It is gratifying to note that in the course of the last two or three years optimistic voices have been clearly heard within this house concerning a renewed relaxation of international tensions.We share this optimism. Such optimism may be attributed  above all  to the emerging consensus in the international community on the necessity for the coexistence and co-operation of all States and to the experiences gained and the achievements made in resolving contemporary issues. In our view  the present positive trend is likely to succeed and to become a continuous and irreversible process. The first stones of its foundation are being hewn from very solid elements  expressing a balance of the legitimate interests of the parties in the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations. This reinforces our belief in the possibility of creating a more just and humane future. It will naturally require extensive joint efforts on the part of all States.It is important that the majority of States already realize this fact more clearly and are acting accordingly. There is a continuing dialogue between the great Powers in the search for ways aid means of fostering detente in all its dimensions. An all-European process encompasses new frontiers. An ever increasing number of States are contributing to the efforts to solve acute regional problems. Awareness and concern over the world-wide harmful consequences of the ecological crisis and the inequitable international economic order are growing. The importance of a comprehensive approach to the problems of strengthening international peace and security is gaining increasing recognition.One of the new trends of the present time is the growing prestige and role of the United Nations in world affairs. Hare the tendency towards co-operation is being strengthened aid the United Nations is being used in a manner in which it was originally conceived by its founders. The Mongolian people's Republic welcomes the intensification of the peace-making efforts of the United Nations and the good offices of secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and wishes him further success in his noble endeavours. We advocate a broader release of the potential of the world Organization for the resolution of global problems  such as disarmament  putting an end to regional conflicts  overcoming the socio-economic and technological backwardness of developing countries  and for the resolution of the problems of external indebtedness  protection of the environment  the struggle against the traffic in narcotic drugs  and others.The Mongolian delegation fully shares the idea of enhancing the role of the United Nations in the prevention of problems  expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization.The Mongolian People's Republic will strive to expand its practical co-operation with the United Nations and the organizations of its system.A process of critical analysis of all experience in constructing our socialist society and of drawing appropriate lessons for the future  is under way in my country. The problems which my country faces in its development today are typical of those facing many developing countries. The essence of these problems lies in the necessity to accelerate socio-economic development and on this basis to improve the well-being of the people. In order to achieve these goals it is equally important to set in motion both domestic and external factors. It is against this background that certain aspects of our foreign policy are under review.The relations of Mongolia with the socialist countries under the impact of ongoing restructuring processes are assuming an increasingly business-like character and their effectiveness is growing.The Mongolian People's Republic  as a developing country  is endeavouring to enhance this status in international organizations and to strengthen its solidarity and co-operation with the other developing countries within the framework of these organizations. We are reconsidering our staid vis-Ã -vis certain international economic and monetary-financial institutions with a view to benefiting from the services they render to developing countries.The realization of that policy by my Government is evidenced in its obtaining of Observer status in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  in its membership in the Group of 77 in the establishment of diplomatic relations with the European Economic Community  and in its efforts to obtain membership in the Asian Development Bank.Apart from that  efforts are being made to broaden its political  trade  economic aid cultural co-operation with other States. We are interested in making substantial headway in developing mutually advantageous trade and economic ties with the market economies. Initial steps are being taken towards that end.All of this is needed  in our view  in order to lay the foundation for the subsequent constructive participation of Mongolia in a broader regional and international integration.We see the primary objective of the international community in the sustained consolidation of the present positive trends. Equally important is the task of promoting trust and mutual understanding between States at both the global and the regional level. Thi3 is also essential for developing broad  mutually beneficial international co-operation and for tackling the existing serious problems.In this regard  the region of Asia and the Pacific to which my country belongs deserves special attention. As is known  the most protracted and acute regional conflicts continue to exist there. The reduction of military confrontation  the elimination of foreign military bases and the development of economic  ecological and other co-operation are issues that must be duly dealt with.Experience shows that it is better to seek generally acceptable solutions through dialogue and negotiations. It is pertinent to stress here the importance of normal  close relations between the great Powers of the region. In this connection  we wish to stress the truly international significance of the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.Mongolia is seeking to contribute to the positive changes in our region. Our response to this improved atmosphere in our region has been evidenced by the Mongolian and Soviet agreements on the withdrawal of a major portion of the Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia and by the decision on a marked reduction of our armed forces and military expenditures.My Government has recently advanced an idea with regard to the possibility of holding a dialogue on a regular basis among the countries of the northern part of the region of Asia and the Pacific. It seeks to help find ways and means of developing co-operation in various areas  settling existing problems  and strengthening mutual understanding and confidence among the nations of the region. We invite the parties concerned to reflect on this idea and to exchange views on it. The Mongolian Government favours an early political solution to regional conflicts. We call for an immediate cessation of the bloodshed in Afghanistan. The Geneva Agreements must be strictly implemented by all parties. It is important  in our view  to examine closely the recent proposals  which could create additional opportunities for resolving this problem.We welcome the withdrawal of the Vietnamese volunteers as announced earlier and we hope that the dialogue that took place or. the Cambodian issue will continue and bring about a comprehensive solution to that problem.As in the past  Mongolia advocates a peaceful and democratic reunification of Korea without outside interference. I wish to note here the importance of exerting further efforts toward undertaking an inter-Korean dialogue.Aggravation of the dangerous situation in Lebanon end the absence of practical results in resolving the Palestine problem  despite realism and the desire to co-operate demonstrated by the PLO leadership  emphatically underline the need to achieve an early and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis and to convene for this purpose an international conference  with the participation of all the interested parties  including the State of Palestine and the permanent members of the Security Council. The right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and that of all States oÂ£ the region to a secure existence should be ensured.The Mongolian people's Republic is in favour of full implementation of the United Nations plan on the granting of independence to Namibia.We resolutely condemn the policy and practices of apartheid and advocate their liquidation. We are in solidarity with the struggle of the Nicaraguan people and its Government for their freedom and independence  sovereignty and national dignity. The Mongolian delegation supports the efforts of the Central American States and the United Nations aimed at the peaceful settlement of the problem.The disarmament process set in motion by the Treaty on the Elimination of Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - has of late been gaining new momentum. Here we have in mind the prospects of concluding an agreement on the reduction of strategic offensive armaments of the USSR and the United States in the light of the recent accords in Wyoming  of banning chemical weapons and initiating the destruction of their stockpiles  as well as of achieving real progress at the Vienna talks on the reduction of armed forces and armaments in Europe.We submit that the General Assembly should renew its call for the cessation of the arms race  for the prevention of the militarization of outer space and for the complete prohibition of nuclear tests. The Mongolian People's Republic favours the convening of an international conference with the purpose of converting the 1963 Moscow Treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in three environments into a treaty on a comprehensive banning of such tests. The Mongolian delegation shares the view that the positive changes and shifts of a political nature in the world are not yet buttressed by adequate progress in resolving the problems of international economic relations. The development of economic co-operation is frustrated not only by factors of an objective nature but also by artificial barriers which  inter alia  are at variance with the overall spirit of the new detente.We deem it important to intensify the global dialogue  first of all within the framework of the United Nations  cm world trade and economic relations in all major directions - North-South  East-West and South-South.we share the reasoning of the other developing countries  expressed particularly at the Belgrade summit conference of the non-aligned countries and at the Caracas ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 that the consequences of the absence of a solution to the problems of the economic development of these countries will have an increasing impact on the developed countries as well. This global interdependence should be established on an equal and collective footing with a view to ensuring social justice and economically sustainable development for all. In our opinion  this interdependence should be duly taken into account in the elaboration of the international development strategy for the 1990s and in the decisions of the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on international economic co-operation.The problem of the external indebtedness of developing countries still remains acute. The ongoing dialogue within the United Nations and outside it on resolving this problem inspires some optimism.As is known  the protection of nature and of the environment has become a most important global problem and one which requires urgent international efforts. The Mongolian People's Republic therefore attaches great importance to the convening in 1992 of a United Nations conference on the environment and development. In this context I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Assembly to the idea submitted by the Mongolian delegation at the latest session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific on the elaboration of regional and sub regional programmes of action for the protection of the environment in the Asia and the Pacific region and on the creation of a regional centre on the environment. In our opinion  such steps would help to co-ordinate the national efforts of the countries of the region to create ecologically sound living conditions.The consequences of environmental degradation adversely affect the living conditions of many people  even of entire nations. This problem has become so acute that it is  in our view  essential to raise the question of putting into treaty language the issue of a human right to a better and healthy environment. This question does not seem to be adequately reflected in the existing international instruments on human rights. We therefore deem it desirable to consider the question of making an appropriate amendment to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Sights.In doing so we proceed from the premise that the development of international law and the ensuring of its primacy are important elements in strengthening peace and co-operation among States. In this connection  we consider that the proposal of the non-aligned countries to declare a United Nations decade of international law a timely initiative."
"96",4806,"MOZ",44,1989,"ï»¿It is with profound satisfaction that I congratulate the President on his unanimous election to preside over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are proud when a sot of Africa is elected to a position of such responsibility. His long diplomatic experience and the dedication and competence with which he guided the work of the Special Committee against Apartheid guarantee that our work will be crowned with success. We wish him every success in discharging the high responsibility with which he has been unanimously entrusted. We express again our readiness to offer him all our support and co-operation for the success of the Assembly's deliberations.We commend the outgoing President  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the lucid aid efficient manner with which he presided over the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.He seize this occasion to express our special appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his contribution in the search for solutions to regional conflicts  and the other problems that affect international peace and security. He commend his personal commitment in securing support for the emergency programme in Mozambique. We renew our hopes that these efforts will continue as long as the critical situation in my country prevails.The current session of the General Assembly offers us an opportunity to make an assessment of the avenues we have explored thU3 far in the search for ways aid means more conducive to a future of peace and stability in our world. The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization (A/44/1)  and several preceding speakers have described the present trend in international relations as positive and promising. He subscribe to this assessment. Indeed  the current international atmosphere appears to be less gloomy than a few years back  less tense and less volatile.It is evident that constructive steps have been taken since the last session of the General Assembly.The dialogue and rapprochement between the two major Powers are a contributing factor to the present trend in the international situation. That trend is also a result of the struggle of the peace-loving peoples of the whole world  who have always pleaded for disarmament  peace and international security. We hope this trend may continue  be strengthened and play a catalytic role in efforts towards the elimination of hotbeds of tension in the world. In my country  this new dynamic in international relations has been received with optimism and expectation inasmuch as it corresponds to the noblest aspirations of the Mozambican people to achieve peace and freedom in our region aid in the world. However  this trend does not appear to have touched the consciousness of those bent on the destruction and destabilization of our country ad on frustrating our project of building a developed  just and democratic society in Mozambique.In the period since the last session  massacres  destruction ad looting have continued unabated in Mozambique. The armed terrorists have continued to destroy hospitals  trains ad railways? they have carried out acts of sabotage on power lines and on economic and social infrastructures.In the same period  more evidence has been gathered again proving that we ate confronted with an operation of destabilization that should not be confused with a struggle between two parties. In fact only a operation of destabilization of this nature can explain the scale of devastation  destruction and terror that has resulted in 700 000 dead  1.7 million displaced Mozambicans  ad 5.6 million citizens living in a state of emergency.Our people are aware that independence and freedom demand sacrifices  including the sacrifice of our own lives. Thus our people have not vacillated in the face of this holocaust  and  guided by their party  FREL1MO  the Mozambican people have harnessed all their resources ad organized themselves to defend the father lad from aggression. Under bullet fire  in the midst of pain and mourning  our people have never stopped producing  under a tree  in the midst of the ruins of what had been a school just the day before  our children carry on with their studies. They learn to love their country  to sow the seeds of a better future.In 1987 the Mozambican Government launched a vast economic recovery programme in our country. This programme is an option aimed at arresting the galloping economic deterioration that has been experienced aid at initiating a progressive recovery of production in various sectors of the economic and social life of the country.The programme is aimed also at the introduction of corrective measures in the economic and financial sectors  and thus at creating conditions for a gradual change of the economic structure upon which our economy is based.Within the framework of this programme modest results have been achieved. For example  an increase in gross domestic product of 3.6 per cent was registered in 1987  and 4.6 per cent in 1988. This is rather encouraging. This growth is due primarily to progress in the fields of agriculture  industry and commerce.In the political field  the Mozambican people  from Rovuma to Maputo  participated in the Fifth Congress of the ERELMO party. This was an excellent occasion to reflect on the past  present and future of the country. Important problems were tackled  related to war and peace  national unity  socio-economic  technical and scientific development  showing once again that all Mozambicans identify themselves with FRELIMO and its goals  and that the FRELIMO party is the party of all Mozambicans. The Congress constituted a high moment in the exercise of democracy.The Fifth Congress of the FRELIMO party took far-reaching decisions for the life of the Mozambican nation. The Congress redefined the strategy aid tactics of the economic and social policies of the country  in response to the present national  regional and international environment. The Congress recommended the adoption of measures to encourage collective and individual participation in production  in particular food production.Changes to the statutes  programme and directives of the FRELIMO party responded to the popular will as expressed in the wide national debate that preceded the Party Congress  which called for the strengthening of the social base of the party as a unifying factor for the nation.The FRELIMO party and the Mozambican Government announced a set of principles to end the war by peaceful means. They may be summarized basically as follows.First  the war in Mozambique is not the result of a struggle between two parties. The armed bandits do not constitute a political party  but are  rather  an instrument of an operation of destabilization carried out against our country.Secondly  policies to guide the country in the political  economic  social and cultural fields are established by national consensus reached through a process of consultation and debate with the people.Thirdly  individual and social liberties such as freedom of worship  freedom of expression aid freedom of assembly are guaranteed. However they must not be used to destroy national unity  national independence or the integrity of persons aid property. They cannot be used for the preparation or perpetration of violent actions against the State and the Constitution.Fourthly  policy or constitutional changes or revisions  or revisions to the main legislation of the country can and should be made only with the broad participation of all citizens.Fifthly  it is unacceptable for a group to use intimidation or violence to impose themselves on society at large. It is anti-democratic to alter the Constitution and the main legislation of the country as a result of the violence of a group.Acceptance of these principles by the ringleaders of the armed bandits is the prerequisite for the beginning of an eventual dialogue between the Government and the leaders of the armed bandits with a view to identifying the modalities and medial is to end violence and to normalize the life of all Mozambicans  including those now involved in armed banditry.Such a dialogue  we must emphasize  cannot and shall not be aimed at creating situations or conditions that might undermine national unity or lead to power-sharing. Any change in the Constitution or in the fundamental legislation of the country can be acceptable only on the basis of the established order  democracy and national consensus and not on the basis of violence by one group against the people  organized society and the State. Since the proclamation of our national independence the adoption of our main legislation has taken place only after consultations and discussions have been carried out among the people. It is in this context that we are now undertaking the revision of the Constitution and the electoral law. This reflects the growth of our democracy and the consolidation of our State.On the basis of the above-mentioned principles  President Chissano  on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Mozambique  has asked Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya to help us to create the necessary conditions for an eventual dialogue between the Government and the ringleaders of the armed bandits.The latter were informed of our 12-point peace initiative by the leaders of certain Mozambican religious denominations that initiated contacts with the ringleaders of the armed bandits with a view to persuading them to stop the massacres and destruction and to reconcile themselves with their fatherland and the people. Two meetings have already been held in Nairobi between the religious leaders of certain denominations and the ringleaders of the armed bandits. This process is still unfolding  and it is too early for us to draw any conclusion. However  as long as the state of war prevails the country will continue to suffer from its devastating effects  the losses being colossal in terms of both human suffering and the destruction of the economic aid social life of our people.The state of emergency is still a reality in our country. It is therefore very encouraging that the international community continues to recognize the urgent need to provide assistance to the affected population in the form of food  clothing and production tools that enable the people to resume their normal lives. In this regard I wish once again to express our gratitude to the entire international community for its invaluable assistance and solidarity.  As this session of the General Assembly is being held  there is hope that we are witnessing the birth of an independent Namibia. As Members of the United Nations  one of the major protagonists in this process  we have the unique responsibility to harness all efforts to ensure that the Namibian people's right to self-determination is exercised with order and harmony  in an atmosphere of justice and democracy. We reaffirm our complete confidence in the Secretary-General? we are certain he will know what measures to take to ensure close monitoring and supervision of the process with a view to detecting  denouncing and neutralizing any and all manoeuvres that may compromise Namibia's transition to independence.In relation to Angola  we reaffirm our support for the Angolan Government peace plan embodied in the Gbadolite Agreements  which were reiterated in Harare and Kinshasa. We are certain that the Angolan people  while relying on their own heroism and determination  will command international solidarity in their search for ways and means to attain peace and national harmony.There is a new expectation and hope with the coming to power of a new leadership in South Africa. This expectation is not shared  however  by the majority of the South African people  for whom speeches in themselves are no guarantee that serious changes will be effected in South Africa. This attitude is a reflection of the climate of mistrust and scepticism rooted in the minds of the majority of the South African people and in the world at large in view of the past record of frustrated expectation.This scepticism can be dissipated only if unequivocal and unchallengeable steps are taken or signs of change are shown by the South African authorities-  the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners? the lifting of the ban on political parties and democratic movements} the ending of the state of emergency? and the beginning of a process of negotiation and dialogue in which all South Africans participate. Through the adoption of a set of such measures the regime would guarantee that space would be opened up for ample and peaceful political participation by the entire South African people in decision-making on the fate of their coin try and the planning and building of a just and democratic society in South Africa.The cessation of regional destabilization would be clear evidence that South Africa is determined to open a new chapter in its relations with the countries of the region. The South African Government thus has an opportunity to prove to the South African people and to the international community its determination to take decisive steps towards the dismantling of the apartheid system aid to take part in the joint efforts of the other countries of the region to build a prosperous southern Africa. We hope that the statements made by South African leaders are harbingers of vigorous steps to be taken in this direction in the future.The current regional and international climate is favourable to the search for a solution to the problem of South Africa. On the other hand  the Organization of African Unity's Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa  meeting in Harare in August 1989  adopted a set of principles that could form the basis for a frank dialogue by all South Africans. We urge the South African authorities to seize this opportunity to put an end once and for all to the apartheid system and build a new society in South Africa.We visualize a South Africa with neither minorities nor majorities based on the colour of skin or on race  a South Africa based on political options  a society where criteria for taking part in the Government or in political aid social life are not determined in racial terms but in terms of one's commitment to the ideal of building a just  democratic aid non-racial society.The apartheid regime is universally condemned not only because it is a white minority regime  but also because  above all  it represents a political option of a minority  a political option based on an anachronism - institutionalised racial discrimination. In South Africa itself there is an increasing number of whites who dissociate themselves from that option of the minority in order to join the cause of the majority.That development is a sign of the emergence of a new South African society where whites aid blacks  Indians or mixed-race individuals - in a word  all races - can live in harmony in a South Africa free of apartheid. It is that South Africa free of apartheid that we believe should be able to contribute with its resources to the common effort of the countries of the region to make southern Africa a politically stable  economically developed  aid prosperous region.In other regions of our continent we are witnessing steady efforts aimed at the peaceful settlement of disputes in the context of our African tradition aid with respect for the principles of the OAU and the United Nations. In this context  we are pleased with the recent accords between Chad end Libya. We are certain that the same spirit will guide the efforts being made towards the solution of other problems between African States.Concerning the Western Sahara conflict  we commend the meetings between His Majesty King Hassan II and the POLISARIO Front. It is our conviction that the relevant OAU and United Nations resolutions continue to be the valid legal and political framework for a just and negotiated settlement of the conflict. We encourage the Secretary-General to pursue his efforts with a view to achieving a speedy solution of the Western Sahara problem.On the Middle East  we view as a matter of urgency the convening of an international conference with the participation of all parties concerned  including the Palestinian State.In the Indo-China peninsula  the initiatives to find a political solution to the Cambodian conflict are encouraging. We commend the steps taken by Vietnam aimed at facilitating national reconciliation in Cambodia.In connection with Afghanistan  we ask the parties to the Geneva Agreements strictly to fulfil the provisions of that accord  in order to bring about peace and national reconciliation.We reaffirm our solidarity with the cause of reunification of the Korean nation.The People's Republic of Mozambique reaffirms its desire to see a frank and serious dialogue between all parties involved in East Timor  with a view to ensuring that the right of the people of that Territory to self-determination is fully respected. In this regard  we hold the view that as long as the fundamental rights of the East Timorese people are not taken into account  there can be no long-lasting  internationally acceptable solution to a war that has claimed more than 200 000 lives. The current international climate  which is conducive to dialogue and the peaceful resolution of regional conflicts  should be an inspiration to all parties involved in the Timor conflict. We commend the Secretary-General for his efforts to resolve the problem.In Central America  we are encouraged by the recent agreements on Nicaragua signed in Honduras  as well as the latest peace initiatives in El Salvador. The restoration of peace and stability  so much desired by the peoples of that region of the American continent  depends  to a large degree  on the implementation of these agreements.For the People's Republic of Mozambique  the transformation of the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace is a constitutional principle. Thus  we appeal to the international community to make a concerted effort to ensure the holding of the Colombo Conference on the Indian Ocean in 1990.In the economic field  the continuing existence of a set of adverse factors that work against the development of the countries of the third world remains a major concern in the context of our own efforts to break away from underdevelopment. The lade of concrete actions aimed at structural transformation upon which the success of our economic plans depends is the cause of the problem.We note in that regard that  three years after the launching of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  the economic situation in our continent remains critical. Little has been achieved in the implementation of that important Programme adopted at the thirteenth special session of the General Assembly. The situation is largely due to the lack or slow implementation of concrete and effective measures in support of the Programme. We therefore appeal to the international community  in particular to the developed countries  to give top priority to the assistance and aid to African countries that would enable us to face the crisis and reactivate our economic and social development.Our economies continue to be subjected to the unrelenting deterioration of the terms of exchange  where the costs of imports are increased while the prices of export products have fallen dramatically. There has also been an increase in interest rates  a drop in the flow of external funding  and an increase in the net transfer of real resources from South to North. The cumulative effect of the external debt must be added to these factors.The external debt remains one of the major obstacles to economic growth aid development. This crucial problem deserves our greatest attention through a constructive aid realistic dialogue between debtors aid creditors on the basis of a spirit of mutual understanding  with a view to finding a solution. We wish at this time to express our deepest appreciation to all those coin tries that  in this spirit  undertook concrete measures in order to alleviate the burden of external debt of the countries with the greatest economic difficulties  as in the case of Mozambique.The People's Republic of Mozambique considers it of fundamental importance for the international community to rally its efforts in order to restructure the present world economic system. To this effect  we are in favour of the launching of global negotiations  for which we retain great hope. They are a starting-point for the resolution of the problems that hinder harmony in international economic relations. The establishment of a new international economic order  in which relations of co-operation between States are based on justice  equity  and mutual benefit  is a fundamental necessity in the democratisation of the world economic system.Finally  we express the hope that the work of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  to be held in April 1990  will be a success. We are certain that  to a large extent  a new dynamic in the economies of the developing countries in the next decade hinges on the success of the session.In conclusion  we should like to reiterate our firm conviction that for a whole set of problems that besiege humanity today the United Nations remains the privileged forum  the one that offers us the best opportunities for exchanging ideas aid co-ordinating our efforts to resolve these problems."
"97",4851,"MRT",44,1989,"ï»¿I have pleasure in extending to Mr. Garba  of Nigeria  the warm congratulations of the Mauritanian delegation on his well deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. This choice is an indication of the great respect and esteem that Nigeria enjoys on the international scene  and a tribute to the experience and personal qualities of Mr. Garba  whose leadership will guarantee achievement of the objectives that have been set for this session. I should like to pay tribute also to Mr. Garba's predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  with whose country - Argentina - we have friendly relations  for the high quality of the work that was done during the forty-third session. I want also to extend our congratulations to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless and devoted efforts towards the realization of this Organization's ideals of peace  justice and equality.The continued improvement in the international political climate and the new prospects for a settlement of certain regional conflicts give rise to great hopes. Peace has started to become a reality for peoples that have been deprived of it for a long time. This process has made it possible  inter alia  to end hostilities between Iraq and Iran  conclude an agreement on Afghanistan  begin the process of implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978) concerning the independence of Namibia  and pursue the mediation efforts of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity relating to the settlement of the problem of the Western Sahara. While lauding the progress achieved in moving towards peace  Mauritania cannot but express its deep concern over the continuation of the Middle East conflict as well as the aggressive practices of the policy of racial discrimination committed against all the peoples of southern Africa.The unshakeable solidarity of my country with the just and legitimate struggle of the Palestinian and the South African peoples has been a constant of our policy  which stems from the fact that we belong to both the Arab and the African worlds. Our geographical and human realities  as well as our history  qualify Mauritania to play an active and constructive role in this field. That role is manifested in our unremitting efforts to cement relations between those two worlds  as well as our active participation in all Arab and African organizations and sub regional groups in North Africa and in the southern Sahara. In this connection  the establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union on 17 February last in Marrakesh  was in response to the aspirations of all the peoples of the region  which have  for generations  longed for such a Union.While positive elements of current international events in recent years are a source of pride and hope for the international community as a whole  regions of crises and tension remain where our serious and prompt efforts could bring about the necessary solutions. In this context  the question of the Western Sahara continues to be the focus of the attention of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations. The acceptance of the peace proposals of the Secretary-General by both parties concerned  and the initiation of a direct dialogue between the King of Morocco and the representatives of the POLISARIO Front last January  are welcome and positive elements. We sincerely hope that that question will be resolved in a satisfactory manner as soon as possible. That would undoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of a united Maghreb and of African Unity as a whole.These signs of hope  unfortunately  do not emerge everywhere. In the Middle East  the valiant Palestinian people continues to suffer under oppressive Israeli occupation  despite the Palestinian resistance  which grows by the day. The intifadah launched almost two years ago is intensifying in such a way as to leave no doubt that it is not an ephemeral act but is a truly deep expression of the rejection by an entire people of foreign occupation. Therefore  the intifadah will never come to an end as long as the national rights of the Palestinian people continue to be denied.The conscience of the whole world continues to be touched by this tragedy  which has been going on for more than 40 years. Today  a historic occasion is at hand to find a comprehensive  just and final solution to the Palestinian problem  which undoubtedly lies at the heart of the Middle East conflict. The brave decisions adopted by the last meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers and the peace message of Mr. Yasser Arafat  Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PI/D) and head of the Palestinian State  sent to our Assembly at its previous session  are evidence of a sincere desire for peace. In this context  the beginning of an American-Palestinian dialogue is an encouraging sign.But all those peaceful intentions and the desire for dialogue have encountered the intransigence of Israel  which persists in its practices  thinking that it can stop the course of history through the use of blind repression. It is up to all of us who have the power to bring influence to bear on the course of events to remove the last obstacle to peace  in compliance with the resolutions and recommendations repeatedly adopted by the General Assembly.We continue to believe that the only possible way of achieving that result is by convening forthwith an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations and with the participation  on an equal footing  of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. That solution will necessarily have to lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with the Holy City of Al-Quds as its capital  and to the withdrawal of occupying forces from all occupied Arab territories.If the situation remains highly precarious in the Middle East because of the expansionist Zionist policy  peace and security are no less threatened in southern Africa  where the shameful apartheid regime continues to commit the most heinous crimes against the peoples of that region.The policy of violence which that regime has built into a system of government continually arouses the conscience of the entire world aid brings forth its condemnation. Patriots -such as Nelson Mandela still languish in South African gaols  and the most elementary rights are still denied the South African people. This policy has already been condemned as a crime against humanity and must not continue. We believe that comprehensive and mandatory sanctions ate necessary and that any attempt to delay or oppose them is tantamount to prolonging the suffering of the South African people.As stated and demonstrated on many occasions  Mauritania will continue to support tirelessly the just struggle of the South African people until the odious system of apartheid is completely eradicated. In Namibia  hope grows anew with the incipient implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978). After the terrible suffering endured during a lengthy  bitter and pitiless war for national liberation  signs of a final settlement are beginning to emerge as a reward for the Namibian people  who sacrificed life and property in their struggle under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). At this critical juncture  however  when the destiny of an entire nation is at stake  it is necessary to be more vigilant and resolute until the legitimate aspirations of the Namibian people have been completely achieved. While Mauritania commends the efforts made by all parties in order to achieve that result  it hopes and desires that the process thus begun will lead to the independence of Namibia  under the leadership of SWAPO  the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people. In the Gulf the war between the neighbouring countries of Iraq and Iran has been ended thanks to the cease-fire that entered into force on 20 August 1988. Mauritania  which has always worked to bring an end to that destructive war  is pleased at the cessation of hostilities. It expresses its hope that direct negotiations will take place between the two parties  with no pre-conditions whatsoever  under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General in order to achieve a just  comprehensive and lasting peace that will restore stability to the region and enable the two peoples to devote their energies and resources to their own development efforts.In Afghanistan  the Geneva Agreements of 14 April 1988 have led to the withdrawal of all foreign troops. My country cannot but welcome the impressive victory of the fraternal Muslim people of Afghanistan  who did not grudge any sacrifice for the sake of its freedom aid dignity. We hope that the Afghanis will be able to surmount their differences in order to tackle the task of rebuilding their country.In Kampuchea  we take hope from the continuous efforts under way to reach a peaceful solution to its problems. That solution must be based on the many relevant and wise resolutions adopted by the General Assembly  all of which reaffirm the need for the unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops and the free exercise by the Cambodian people of the right to self-determination.In Central America  the peace process has been re-launched by the Tela agreement. Mauritania is pleased at that positive development and hopes that it will lead to the establishment of a just aid lasting peace in that region.With regard to the Korean issue  my country has always advocated the peaceful reunification of the peninsula in the interest of all the Korean people. That reunification  however  must be the outcome of negotiations and dialogue. We are pleased at the initiatives taken by both sides in this connection aid we hope that they will rapidly be crowned with success.The world economic situation remains a source of major concern. The industrialized countries have registered a significant expansion. But the economies of the developing countries are still deteriorating  in spite the major reforms and structural adjustment programmes undertaken by their Governments. The gap between developed and developing countries continues to grow  and the latter still face the decline In the prices of their main products  the overwhelming burden of debts  and the many obstacles to the transfer of technology.The Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries have just reaffirmed at Belgrade that only the resumption of the North-South dialogue and global negotiations to establish a new international economic order can lead to the acceleration of the economic aid social development of developing peoples.The interdependency of nations and the interaction of problems and interrelated interests call for such an approach. It is to be hoped that the Second United Nations Conference on the least Developed Countries and the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade will contribute to achievement of that goal.The developing countries are particularly sorely tried by heavy indebtedness  repayment of which has nullified all their efforts towards development and has led to a situation whose overall outcome is to the benefit of the developed countries.The urgent need to reverse that situation requires the deepening and expanding of the various initiatives that have been announced in tills connection. The initiatives taken by certain court tries such as the Bader al Republic of Germany  France and Canada deserve particular mention. The economic situation in Africa is still particularly critical. Per capita production in the continent has once again declined. Development efforts are still being impeded by external factors over which Africa has no control. Africa is also suffering from the tragic effects of drought  desertification  and the seasonal invasion of locusts. No African com try is capable alone of overcoming the combined effects of economic crisis and natural disasters. Nevertheless  African countries have undertaken major large-scale reforms  in keeping with the commitments entered into in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The co-operation that was to have been engendered by that Programme has not  however  materialized.As a result  the responsibility of the international community remains undiminished in connection with the international communityâs contribution to the continent's economic recovery and development.In the immediate future an appropriate solution to the debt problem must be sought  and the best way to do so remains  in our view  the convening of an international conference on the subject.In national terms  Mauritania is continuing to implement the programme of economic reforms begun in 1985. It has just initiated a programme of economic recovery that has met with the support of our main financial markets  particularly our Arab brothers  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. That programme is aimed in the long term at ensuring self-sustaining development and socio-economic growth. The country's population is already participating effectively in that development effort thanks to widespread democratisation at the grass-roots level  which has made it possible for urban and rural municipalities to control their own independent management. The campaign against illiteracy is another important aspect of the development programme  A special State secretariat has been established to eradicate that scourge by the year 2000. Special attention is being given to the participation of women  who have been playing an increasingly active role in society. In order to institutionalise that role a ministry on the status of women was created a year ago.I should like to take this opportunity to express our very deep gratitude to the countries and international organizations that have helped us to put our various development programmes into effect. Recently  when thousands of our citizens returned to the national territory under tragic circumstances  those friendly countries and international organizations quickly and generously participated in our efforts to reabsorb the returnees.In our view  economic questions constitute the major challenge of our time  and for that reason they deserve special attention. The paradox here is that the resources of the Earth aid the degree of scientific and technological progress we have reached do make it possible to meet all the needs of mankind  but some States still apparently disregard this fact and are devoting to the arms race immense human  material and technological resources. There is a striking contrast between the hundreds of millions of dollars thus allocated to the manufacture  improvement and stockpiling of weapons and the deprivation and abject poverty in which two thirds of the world's population live. The stockpiling of weapons does not guarantee security: it gives rise to the arms race and festers suspicion among States. The time has come to put an end to this escalation  to resort always to peaceful means of settling disputes and to seek security in general and complete disarmament under effective international control.We are pleased at the developments that have occurred over the past few years  but we still hope that further substantial progress will be achieved in this field. Disarmament measures must make it possible to release -additional resources for development and thus contribute to the settlement of urgent international economic problems  which  in turn  would enhance the prosperity and welfare of mankind as a whole.The solution of the world economic problems and conflicts that are still in evidence is within our reach to solve them  it is sufficient to respect the purposes and principles enunciated in the United Nations Charter  to resort to the means of settlement it sets forth. The progress made along these lines has been great  but it must be consolidated. The peoples of the world aspire to peace  and peace is inseparable from development. The main responsibility in this area lies with the United Nations  which was set up to preserve international peace and security and to resolve international problems of an economic and social nature. But to truly carry out this noble mission  the United Nations needs the confidence of all its members. The increased interest in it that has been demonstrated recently bodes well for the future.The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has always been faithful to the ideals of the United Nations Charter and is convinced that the only way to meet the world challenges we ate facing today is to uphold the noble and humanitarian principles of the Charter of our Organization.

"98",4897,"MUS",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like to extend to Ambassador  Garba  on behalf of my delegation  my sincere congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. That this important session has been placed in the hands of a distinguished son of Africa is a matter of great pride to my delegation and to Africa as a whole. There can be no doubt that he will conduct our deliberations with authority and efficiency.I Should also like to express our deep appreciation to his predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo  Foreign Minister of Argentina  for the exemplary manner in which he presided over our deliberations during a very eventful year. I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express to our Secretary-General my delegation's congratulations for his outstanding contribution in the pursuit of world peace and stability. He has succeeded in solving a number of pending regional crises and in improving the work of the Secretariat under difficult financial constraints. He can rest assured of our continued support.This year we have witnessed the consolidation of peace processes. Great progress has been made in relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Treaty on the elimination of inter mediate-range and shorter-range missiles signed by the United States and the Soviet Union and ratified in June 1988 is a historic agreement because it is the first in recent history to abolish a whole category of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of the superpowers. In the sphere of multilateral disarmament the Paris Conference on chemical weapons  held in January this year  gave support and impetus to the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. My delegation looks forward to the day when an effective and universal chemical-weapons convention banning the production  storage and use of such weapons can be implemented.My delegation notes with satisfaction the progress achieved in the negotiation on conventional arms in Europe  proposals for military reductions and confidence-building measures have been admitted by both Western and Eastern Groups at the recent Vienna meeting. It is hoped that those talks will lead to an effective and concrete reduction in the armed forces and conventional weapons in that region.Our concern for peace should be global  we must take advantage of the new rapport between Washington and Moscow to liquidate any area of tension and confrontation  wherever it happens to be.It is high time that the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean started the process of the demilitarisation of that ocean by calling for the convening of the long-overdue Conference not later than 1990  with the active participation of all permanent meters of the Security Council as well as the major maritime Powers. AS the Assembly is aware. the Government and people of Mauritius have not accepted the fact that an important part and parcel of their territory has been excised by the former colonial Peer in contravention of United Nations General Assembly resolutions 1514  XV| and 2066 (XX . The dismemberment of Mauritian territory constitutes an unacceptable affront to our sovereignty. Mauritius cannot and .ill not remain silent until Diego Garcia and the Chagos Archipelago  as well as the Tromelin Islands. are returned to us. Our claim is just and legitimate. We have the total support of the Organisation of African Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  we appeal to the international community and to all peace-loving countries to assist us in the restoration of our territories. Our islands should not serve as a nuclear base and should not constitute a threat to our own security and to that of all the littoral âd hinterland states of the region.The current political situation in South Africa calls for careful reflection and handling. We all agree that apartheid is the root cause of conflict in that region  and we have repeatedly called for its total elimination. It is a matter of comfort to note that many of our elder statesmen in Africa are initiating contacts with the South African Government in the true spirit of dialogue with a view to Pressing that Government to make the necessary changes to the satisfaction of one and all. We fervently hope that the changes promised by the new South African Government are genuine and that it will soon embark on the total dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a free  united and democratic society based on universal suffrage.We cannot accept that a leader of the calibre of Nelson Mandela should be eternally confined to house arrest simply because he dared to raise his voice against apartheid. We demand his immediate release and that of all political prisoners. The lifting of all political restrictions  the withdrawal of troops from black townships  the lifting of the state of emergency and the cessation of all political court proceedings can only help to create a climate of confidence for the pursuit of a real and meaningful dialogue between the South African Government and its people. The opening of dialogue with the African National Congress will be a test of the sincerity of the new South African Government.The liberation of Namibia has been a cause near and dear to us. Mauritius has always stood firmly by Security Council resolution 435 (1978  and its reaffirmation this year in resolution 632 (1989)  as well as the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG  needs all our political and diplomatic support to lead and organize a smooth transition through free elections without interference and intimidation. We wish Namibia and the valiant Namibian people a new dawn and a bright and prosperous future.With the resolution of the Namibian problem there was hope for a quick end to the conflict in Angola. We note with much regret  however  that the recent Gbadolite accord has failed to be given concrete effect  leaving the people of Angola still in the grips of war.It is our fervent wish that peace will prevail in Mozambique  which has endured untold sufferings for far too long  similarly  we greatly commend the initiative of President Mubarak  the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  to mediate in the tragic conflict between two neighbourly African countries  Mauritania and Senegal.My delegation last year rejoiced at the cessation of hostilities between the brotherly States of Iran and Iraq and their acceptance of the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We pledge to support the Secretary-General in his ceaseless efforts to quicken the pace of negotiations and entreat both parties to co-operate in good faith in order to reach a common understanding and a lasting peace between the two countries.We are deeply concerned over the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank end the Gaza Strip  which poses a serious threat to international peace and security. We fully support the just struggle of the Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for the recovery of their lost territory.The intifadah  which has been going on for nearly two years  has made it clear that the Middle East stalemate cannot continue for ever. Israel must negotiate with the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  the PLO. Any attempt to create a local Palestinian leadership in the West Bank is doomed to failure.The PLO's desire for peace has been expressed emphatically  at the Palestinian National Council meeting in Algiers and at the United Nations General Assembly session in Geneva last year. This has entailed a major shift in the attitude of many nations to the PLO.Tb prevent the tragic scenario in the Middle East from deteriorating further into a global crisis  the convening of an international conference under the aegis of the United Nations  with all parties  including the PLO  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 335 (1973)  is of the utmost necessity. NO one can be insensible to the tragedy which has engulfed Lebanon. Such tragedies will recur unless and until we see the withdrawal of all external forces. The Arab League  the tripartite Committee on Lebanon and the international community must continue their efforts towards bribing peace and security in this war-torn country.My delegation also deplores the fact that despite the Korean people's aspirations for the peaceful reunification of their homeland  Korea remains divided. This situation remains a great threat to peace. We welcome the efforts of the Korean people to reunify their homeland peacefully without any foreign interference and by means of dialogue and consultations between the North and the South.The signing of the Geneva Agreements and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan had raised high hopes that peace would soon come to that country. My delegation notes with regret that the hopes have not been realized because of the non-observance of the spirit of the Geneva Agreements. Afghanistan presents a harrowing picture of devastation  of a million dead and 5 million refugees. The flow of more  lethal weapons will not break the stalemate that has settled over the conflict. The civil war since the pullout by the Soviet troops  during the last six months  has amply demonstrated that there can be no military solution to the Afghan conflict. A political settlement is the only way out. We appeal to theUnited States and the Soviet Union  to bring the diverse elements together with a view to bringing an end to the present bloodshed in Afghanistan and restoring peace under an Afghan Government of national reconciliation.My delegation welcomes the recent initiatives of the Presidents of the five Central American countries in their quest for peace and stability in that region. We are glad to learn that a United Nations mission will be sent to observe the elections in Nicaragua early next year. Similarly  we commend the ceaseless efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General in bringing about the resumption of intercommunal talks in Cyprus. We hope that a permanent and durable solution will be found  to the satisfaction of both communities there.We also wish to see peace and stability prevail in South-East Asia. The people of Cambodia have gone through great sufferings in recent years. The International Conference in Paris did not bring about the much-desired agreement between the parties engaged in the conflict. We still believe that all foreign troops should leave Cambodia - and we welcome the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops - and that the Cambodians should be given the opportunity to determine their destiny freely and without any hindrance. There should  however  be a guarantee that there will not be a return to the ""killing fields""  to the genocide that still haunts the people of Cambodia.It is an undeniable fact that the economies of the industrialized countries have been steadily growing during the last few years. Unfortunately  the developing countries have not benefited from this growth. On the contrary - their economies have been declining. Most countries in Africa and Latin America and several in Asia have fallen into a deep and protracted crisis. Their economic conditions are worsening  their social services are deteriorating  and the political stability is endangered. This negative trend in the world economy is likely to persist in the years to come unless decisive steps are taken globally. The combined effect of the debt problem and the scarcity of new financial flows has further exacerbated the economic crisis in the developing countries.African debt has risen sharply from $78 billion in 1980 to $230 billion in 1988. African countries are having to borrow more and more to service their debts  thus enduring more severe economic hardship  while we appreciate the gestures made by some industrialized countries  such as France  the United States. Canada  the Federal Republic of Germany and others  in alleviating the debt burdens of several of the most indebted developing countries  we cannot but re-emphasize that as long as the third world is made to retain the role of mere supplier of raw materials at non-remunerative prices  its future will continue to be bleak and the scourges ofpoverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy will continue to exist as we step into the next century.A redefinition of economic co-operation is therefore essential to the prevention of a further deterioration in the situation. Economic relationships must be based on equality  partnership and interdependence. It is imperative that products originating in the third world countries should receive fair and remunerative prices and should not be subjected to various constraints. International agreements aimed at stabilizing prices of primary commodities must be negotiated and implemented. The countries of the industrialized world  which has the skills  the technical know-how and the economic means  are better placed to restructure their industries so as not to affect the nascent industries of third world countries  which otherwise will have to face severe competition. Growth and prosperity can be realized only by these measures. Such a liberalizing philosophy will mirror international solidarity and true partnership  m order to address adequately the pressing issue of international debt  there is an urgent need to reactivate the North-South dialogue and convene  as proposed by the recent Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries  an appropriate forum under the auspices of the United Nations to review ail aspects of the problem of external debt within the context of an improved environment for development and international economic co-operation.We are deeply concerned by the state of the world environment. The warming of the atmosphere and the depletion of the ozone layer constitute a threat to the ecosystem which nay in turn affect the very existence of mankind. Island countries which are already prone to natural disasters such as cyclones and hurricanes are now facing grave threats from the rising seas - which is a direct effect of environmental imbalances. Furthermore  the oceans are being polluted by the irrational dumping of industrial wastes. Unless immediate measures are taken to prevent the aggravation of the situation we shall run the risk of compromising an important source of food supplies and raw materials.While we welcome recent initiatives on global environmental issues  such as the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer and the Hague Convention  and take note of the positive actions relating to dumping of toxic wastes  we urgently appeal for remedial measures to be taken in favour of the most affected regions and we call for international support and solidarity in checking the pollution of our environment. At the national level also  the protection and the preservation of the environment must become an important factor in the conception  implementation and execution of new projects and programmes.Finally  I should like to refer to a problem which has assumed alarming international proportions. Drug trafficking and addiction  to which the problem of AIDS is intimately connected  is already the new scourge of mankind. My Government has taken drastic measures to combat drug trafficking  and we will support all steps taken at the international level in this respect.We are almost on the threshold of a new millennium  and we have no doubt that the major intractable global problems facing mankind and our planet will be handled with wisdom  vision and foresight  bearing in mind the enlightened principles of the United Nations Charter. The challenges we face prompt us to arm ourselves with a spirit of solidarity enabling us to confront the future with confidence and serenity.Man has survived many wars and conflicts  and I am confident that in the nuclear age he will be able to muster courage and fortitude and use the natural intelligence with which he has been endowed to keep premature death and destruction away from his doorstep. I conclude by reaffirming my faith in mankind's willingness and ability to survive and to create conditions for a better tomorrow."
"99",4934,"MWI",44,1989,"I should like  on behalf of the Malawi delegation  to congratulate Ambassador Garba on his unanimous election to the president of- forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. He brings with him to that important position well-tested political and diplomatic skills  as well as a widely acknowledged wealth of experience in international affairs. We are already aware of his outstanding achievements in the many important posts he has held in the service both of his own country and of international organizations  including the United Nations  relating to the promotion of international understanding and co-operation. are more than confident  therefore  that under his leadership and guidance the Assembly will be able to achieve success by aiming for pragmatic resolutions in its work. I should like to assure him of the Malawi delegation's full co-operation at all times.My delegation also congratulates his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina  on the effective manner in which he presided over the forty-third session. during that session the General Assembly was able to accomplish almost ail of the work that had been assigned to it. We believe that much of the success was due to the business-like manner in which Mr. Caputo approached the duties and responsibilities entrusted to him  as well as the firmness and fairness with which he directed the Assembly's deliberations. My delegation wishes him well in all his future endeavours.I should like to express the Malawi Government's satisfaction at the manner in which the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  has continued to manage and direct the affairs of the United Nations. The past 12 months have seen yet greater efforts to ensure further improvement in the operations of the organization and in the management of its financial and other resources. Meanwhile  we note the patience and diligence with which the Secretary-General and his staff have carried out the mandates already given them by the General Assembly and the Security Council  especially in respect to the solution of already existing problems. We have also noted with satisfaction the timely initiatives taken by the Secretary-General to facilitate the search for formulas for solutions to the problems that have emerged since the last session of the Assembly  thus effectively helping to reduce international tensions and conflicts while at the same time promoting understanding and co-operation.My delegation wishes to assure fee Secretary-General and his staff of the Malawi Government's full support for their invaluable contribution to the preservation of international peace and to the promotion of international understanding  co-operation and development. My delegation would like to express its sense of encouragement at the many signs of apparently positive developments we have observed during the past 12 months in the sphere of international peace. For  while some incidents of tension and conflict have occurred during that period  in general the international atmosphere seems to have been marked by relative tranquillity.Although there would seem to be cause for optimism on the political plane  the situation in the economic sphere does not  alas  seem to have provided us with as much reason to feel the same kind of encouragement. while some very interesting initiatives undertaken or proposed by countries of the industrialised North have been noted  North-South relations have remained unbalanced in favour of the North. At the same time the economic situation of most developing countries has continued its rapid deterioration  wife the consequent threat to their political and social stability.The Malawi delegation wishes to join those who have spoken earlier in expressing pleasure and encouragement at fee fact feat a number of questions of conflict and disputes that have preoccupied the international community may very soon be removed from the Assembly's agenda. In this context we have in mind  among others things  the question of the Territory of Namibia  which  under the supervision of fee United Nations  now seems well advanced on the road to independence. We in Malawi welcomed the news of the successful conclusion of the agreements signed in New York in December 1988  which provided for fee withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola and facilitated the implementation of Security Cornell resolution 435 (1978) en fee independence of Namibia  Despite some of the difficulties that threatened to derail the process of transition in Namibia  we believe that it can now be confidently expected that the elections for the Constituent Assembly will take place in November  as scheduled  and that in the New Year the new State of Namibia will finally be born. Of those who might still feel tempted to impede the process of transition to independence we ask these questions. Have the people of Namibia not waited long enough for their country's independence? Have the people of Namibia not already paid more than sufficiently for their own birthright to freedom?We would like to pay a special tribute to fee Secretary-General and to those serving in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) for their courage and determination in striving for the faithful implementation of the independence process in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). For its part  and in recognition of fee importance of this independence process  as well as in the hope of actively helping to ensure its fulfilment  my country has decided to join the Organization of African Unity Observer Group in Namibia. Meanwhile  the Malawi delegation looks forward to seeing Namibia take its place in the Assembly at its next session.When I had the honour of addressing the Assembly at the forty-third session I observed that most of the breakthroughs that had been achieved on a number of political questions during the previous 12 months were due mainly to co-operation between fee superpowers  fee United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In this connection we expressed the hope that the two super-Powers would also turn their attention to two of fee seemingly most intractable problems confronting the international community: namely  the political deadlock in the Middle East and the dangerous situation in southern Africa arising from South Africa's campaign to preserve its policy of apartheid.We in Malawi have noted with much encouragement the apparent indications that the super-Powers may indeed have begun to co-operate on these issues  for some very significant new developments have occurred  hinting at the possibility of new approaches to the two questions.With regard to southern Africa we have witnessed during the past 10 months a number of encouraging developments. For us in Malawi  perhaps the most significant aspect of those developments is the apparent new desire for peaceful  negotiated solutions to existing political disputes and conflicts.In this context we welcomed the agreement in June by the leaders of Angola and ON IT A - the Onion for the Total Independence of Angola - which provides for a cease-fire between the Angolan military forces and those of UN IT A and also calls for negotiations foe a settlement of the political differences between the MPLA Government and UNITA.My delegation has noted that despite the difficulties that have impeded progress efforts continue in the search for ways to resume the process of negotiation. We support those efforts because we believe that negotiation is the only vehicle for reaching a permanent  equitable settlement.We have been similarly encouraged by recent positive announcements with regard to the political situation in Mozambique. Far too many human lives and too much invaluable property have been lost  while Mozambique's social and economic development has been severely impeded as a result of the insurgency by RENJIMO rebels during the past 14 years. We believe that it is time that the people of Mozambique were finally able to begin to enjoy the peace  stability and socio-economic development that they had expected to come after their long and bitter war of liberation.As one of the neighbouring countries that have also borne part of the brunt of the conflict in Mozambique Malawi fervently hopes feat the invitation issued by President Joachim Chissano to RENJMO to join his Government in seeking a negotiated solution will bear fruit. We support the Mozambique Government's bold initiative on this matter. I should therefore like to take this opportunity to declare Malawi's readiness to render such assistance as it can to contribute to the furtherance of the current initiatives and to their successful conclusion.The countries in our sub region of southern Africa are very closely interlinked  historically  politically  socially and economically. Consequently  instability or conflict in any one country invariably has an effect on the others as well. We have already seen fee damaging impact that fee conflicts in Angola and Mozambique have had on neighbouring countries. Similarly  the tensions and conflicts engendered by apartheid inside South Africa have left an indelible mark on all the southern African States. Therefore  any further escalation of the violence that now pervades that country would in our view not only have adverse implications for the future development of South Africa itself but also greatly worsen fee political and economic difficulties now being experienced by its neighbours.It is for this reason that we in Malawi have welcomed the signs of apparent rethinking by the Government  as well as by some anti-apartheid movements  on how best to bring about political change in South Africa. We wish to express the hope that these developments will provide the much-needed impetus for a rapid movement towards a solution to the problem.Wife regard to the Middle East  we in Malawi believe that the declaration last December by fee Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) of its recognition of the State of Israel removed the main obstacle to any meaningful search for a solution to the political problems of that region. But that declaration  in our view  constitutes only one of the prerequisites for any permanent and equitable solution. The others include the right of the State of Israel  as well as all other States in the region  to live within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to their own homeland..We note that in the wake of the PLO declaration recognizing the State of Israel and affirming that organization's readiness to enter into a dialogue on the political future of the Palestinian people a number of interesting proposals have been presented on how to resolve the problems of the Middle East. We welcome the dialogue  both direct and indirect  between the various parties to the Middle East question that has been reported in recent months  and we sincerely hope that all these developments will continue and that they will contribute towards a universally acceptable formula for solving the Middle East problem.Another matter that we believe needs the concerted attention of the major Powers  particularly the super-Powers  is the situation in Lebanon. In this connection we are pleased to note the resumption of the pan-Arab efforts to bring the two sides in that country's 13-year-old civil war together to negotiate a permanent peace agreement. None the less  we wish to appeal to all those with an interest and influence in the Lebanese situation to give this question the most urgent attention. In the mean time  we should like to observe that in order to be viable any solution to this question must include the total withdrawal of all foreign troops and other foreign elements from Lebanon. For until all external forces end their physical presence in that country and refrain from encouraging inter communal rivalry among the Lebanese people  peace will not return to that land. He therefore appeal to all of Lebanon's neighbours to respect its sovereignty and refrain from interfering in its internal affairs.with regard to the problem of Western Sahara  we are encouraged by the continuing co-operation between the United Nations and the organization of African Unity (OAU). Indeed we welcome some of the Secretary-General's most recent initiatives on this matter. However  the Malawi delegation notes with deep regret that  despite the optimism which was engendered by Morocco's and the POLISARIO's acceptance last year of Mr. Perez de Cuellar's proposals for bringing about a solution to the question  there has apparently been no further progress. He believe that time is of the essence  and that the time to act is now.My delegation continues to be optimistic that lasting peace will eventually come to the various parts of the world currently locked in conflicts. The Malawi Government therefore supports the continuing efforts aimed at finding solutions in the various other areas of tension and conflict in the Mediterranean  Asia and in South-East Asia and in Central America. We especially welcome the withdrawal of all foreign troops from some of these areas as a first step towards finding durable . and lasting solutions to their respective problems.While the resolution of all these existing regional conflicts - as well as others that might yet occur - could bring some peace  this in our view would not by itself assure permanent peace or guarantee international security. It is necessary to eliminate the causes of differences between nations  as well as the tools of war that tend to encourage nations to turn differences and tensions into armed conflict. Hence to us the adage that ""If you want peace  prepare for war"" is no longer a sound principle upon which nations should base their security. We believe  rather  that security today demands that the adage be chanced to ""If you want peace  prepare for peace"".In this context  the Malawi delegation is encouraged to note that concerted international effort in search of ways to bring about total and comprehensive global disarmament remains a high priority  despite the many setbacks often encountered. We applaud the important role the United Nations plays in keeping this question at the centre of International attention.We are also encouraged by the steady increase in co-operation between the super-Powers in matters of disarmament. The initiatives and measures they have embarked upon  or on which agreements have been reached  in particular with respect to the elimination or the reduction of certain types and classes of weapons in their own respective arsenals  have had a positive effect on the world-wide campaign for disarmament.Permit me  however  to express the Malawi Government's hope that the super-Powers will realize that  while the elimination of all types of arms is indeed necessary and urgent  the use of outer space only for purposes that will increase man's knowledge of his world in order to promote development and welfare here on his own planet will enhance the desired goal of global disarmament and security.It is a matter of concern to my delegation that the situation on the economic front  especially for the majority of the developing countries  has continued to worse) despite clear warnings of the frightful implications for global peace and security. The debt burden plaguing the developing countries has reached a crisis point; the reverse net flow of funds from developing to developed countries now runs into billions of dollars. The terms of trade have become totally unrealistic. The prices of primary goods produced by the countries of the developing South have continued their downward spiral  while higher tariff barriers against their finished goods have risen in the markets of the developed countries of the world.We have of course closely followed developments since the Montreal Declaration by the industrialized group of States in 1988  and we have also noted with some interest recent initiatives  including those taken by the United States of America  Canada and France  aimed at easing the difficulties of countries facing heavier debt burdens.Welcome as such initiatives may be  they can only serve as palliatives in the face of the enormous economic problems facing the affected countries. Moreover  we are rather uncertain about the helpfulness or justice of the conditionalities  such as the acceptance of an externally prescribed structural adjustment programme  attached to some of these initiatives. It is especially so in view of the now accepted fact of the non-universal applicability or effectiveness of adjustment schemes. Indeed  even where there has been an apparent positive effect  such as in the seemingly successful balancing of national books of accounts  the social cost of implementing such programmes has been very high and fraught with great political risks for the Governments concerned.My delegation wishes to recall that in its mid-term review in 1988 of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  the General Assembly pointed out the consensus that the structural adjustment programmes currently prescribed by such international financial institutions as the International Monetary Fund  especially in the case of Africa  have tended to exacerbate rather than ameliorate the economic situation plaguing the continent.It was for that reason that the African States took the initiative to consider the possibility of alternative adjustment programmes or mechanisms. The African Ministers of Finance and Economic Planning recently adopted  and the OAU Heads of State or Government Summit endorsed  the Alternative Strategy for African Economic revitalization Framework. The second session of the Economic and Social Council has already considered that Strategy  which is due to be presented before this Assembly. It has been studied by experts from international financial institutions  including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  which found it viable as an alternative to the current structural adjustment mechanism. The Malawi delegation sincerely hopes that the General Assembly will find it possible to lend it its support.In the light of factors such as that Strategy and other alternative ways of dealing with the economic problems  the Malawi delegation considers that the insistence upon programmes presented by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as pre-conditions for receiving economic relief is not completely helpful or fully just.The economic crisis facing the developing countries cannot  as experience has shown  be redressed by merely looking at only one aspect in isolation of other aspects. We have consistently stated that the most effective way to deal with the problem is to approach it in a global manner  addressing all of its aspects together  both from the perspective of the developing countries and also from that of the developed countries. Only in that way can a comprehensive and effective formula for solving the existing problems be reached. It is for this reason that my delegation looks forward to the special session of the General Assembly on economic co-operation to be held in April 1990. It is our sincere hope that the special session will provide an opportunity for the creditor nations of the North and the debtor States of the South to work together in finding better solutions to these problems. As has been observed by economic and development experts  the problems currently afflicting developing States have an equally negative impact on the economies of the developed. A resolution of these problems would therefore be of mutual benefit to all. The onus of finding an effective solution is ipso facto  the mutual responsibility of both developed and developing countries.On behalf of the Malawi Government my delegation wishes to express its satisfaction over the apparent improvement in the financial resources of our organization. We are also encouraged to learn from the Secretary-General's annual report that greater effort has been made by member States with arrears on the regular budget to settle their accounts  we also note that the programme of restructuring  begun in 1987  is proceeding smoothly and in most cases is producing the desired effects.The United Nations ability to function effectively and provide the various services it has been mandated to perform depends on having adequate financial and human resources. The continued improvement in the level of funds available to the organization  and the improvement in the quality of the personnel who serve it  assure us that the United Nations will be able to continue to provide the invaluable assistance that is so important in enabling countries such as Malawi to carry out their national programmes for social and economic development.In this context  I would avail myself of this opportunity to express the Malawi Government's appreciation for the assistance it has continued to receive from the United Nations. My Government is particularly grateful at this time for the special assistance that has been rendered through various inter-agency programmes co-ordinated by the United Nations high Commissioner for Refugees in connection with the refugee problem which continues to confront Malawi. In this connection I should further like to express the Malawi Government's encouragement and satisfaction with the co-operation which it has also received from bilateral and other donors.As the General Assembly might be aware  Malawi has since 1986 provided refuge for Mozambican refugees  who now number about 700 000  which is equivalent to about 8 per cent of our national population. While we are most willing to offer hospitality and refuge to our brothers and sisters  Malawi's economic capacity is very limited and the large number of refugees has seriously strained the country's socio-economic infrastructure.This Assembly might wish to know that as a result of the influx there has arisen a problem of internal displacement of Malawians who have been compelled to move from the areas now occupied by the refugees. This has created even greater problems for the Government because  while external assistance has been generous  it could not address the problems of land.Permit me to inform donor agencies  both bilateral and multilateral  that in the case of Malawi the assistance being provided for the refugee community cannot be and is by no means re-channelled to benefit the indigenous people of Malawi. It is for this reason that my delegation would wish to appeal once again  on behalf of the Malawi Government  for increased international assistance so as to enable it to provide relief for refugees who have flocked to Malawi.In concluding my remarks  I should like to express once again to the President our best wishes for his own personal success and also for a very fruitful outcome to the Assembly deliberations."
"100",4980,"MYS",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me at the outset to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. You bring to the presidency unique qualities drawn from your distinguished record both as a soldier and as a diplomat. We can rest assured that with your vast experience and professional skill the deliberations of the General Assembly will be guided to a successful conclusion.I should like also to pay a tribute to His Excellency Mr. Dante M. Caputo  who presided with great distinction over the many meetings of the active and eventful forty-third session of the General Assembly.To the Secretary-General we extend our deepest appreciation for his great efforts and contributions in the cause of international peace and security and in the promotion of international co-operation. We wish to assure him of our continued support for all his endeavours.It is a matter of great satisfaction to me and my delegation that we are gathered here at the United Nations this year in a more positive international political environment conducive to strengthening the credibility and relevance of the United Nations. The continuing detente between the two major Powers has helped sustain the trend towards the relaxation of global tensions in many parts of the world. It has led to increased political co-operation between them  particularly in the important area of disarmament  and to their increased willingness to help find solutions to regional conflicts.These positive trends  which began only a few years ago  have strengthened the fabric of international diplomacy. They have injected a new confidence into the diplomatic process  breathed new hopes and inspired a revitalized faith in the United Nations as a vehicle and catalyst for positive global change. For the first time since the birth of the United Nations we are presented with a unique opportunity to reshape the structure of international relations to conform to the clear desire of mankind for peace  stability  economic growth and prosperity.Restored faith in the United Nations must be matched by tangible action. To start with  that would necessarily entail our making available to it the financial resources it requires to perform its functions  and our full commitment to live up to our respective obligations to respect  uphold and advance the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. It would also require renewing our faith and commitment in advancing the centrality of the United Nations in international affairs vis-Ã -vis the exclusivist new organizations appearing in the international arena. We must be imbued with the same spirit aid vision that brought forth this world Organization 44 years ago.While being gratified at the generally positive international political climate prevailing today  I cannot but voice my delegation's serious concern over the state of affairs in the international economic arena. We find that despite the efforts and clamour for change the present structure of international economic relations remains outworn  outmoded and ill-suited to the demands of the times. Instead of revamping the inequitable economic system  we now see a trend towards a world even more divided between the haves of the North and the have-nots of the South.The inequitable and unjust pattern of international economic relations cannot continue much longer without adverse consequences for both the developed aid the developing countries. This matter must be urgently addressed. The United Nations is best placed to be a catalyst in the promotion of a global dialogue in the interest of ensuring a more stable  equitable and fair economic system. Let us find  during the proceedings at the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly  the still missing collective political will that will move us forward towards attainment of the common good.Allow me at this point to make a brief and general survey of the global situation and to touch on some of the more pressing political  economic and social issues confronting the international community that are of concern to all of us.On the international political landscape  I regret to say that despite the ongoing detente between the two super-Powers there remain many areas of unresolved conflict and confrontation in the world. These must be addressed effectively in our quest for a more stable world.In the Middle East  the new beginnings of peace that were initiated through the historic decisions of the Palestine National Council last November  as well as those initiated by President Arafat during the last session of the General Assembly  have been dashed by the continuing stubbornness of the Israelis. Israel persists in its clear violations of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War despite the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.The heroic intifadah of the brave Palestinian people is a demonstration of their unshakable faith and their determination to struggle for self-determination  independence and nationhood. They have gained the sympathy and support of virtually the entire international community. This is shown by the increased international recognition of the State of Palestine. It has also led to increased contacts with an ever wider circle of States  in particular the United States.The election plan proposed by Israel for the occupied Arab territories does not address the fundamental questions regarding the right of the Palestinians to exercise their self-determination. An occupying Power known mostly for its repressive policies cannot expect to win the support of these it is oppressing to legitimise this very oppression through the so-called elections.My Government continues to believe that a durable  just and comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian issue can only be achieved through the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations  on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). In calling on all members of the international community to support the efforts towards the early convening of that Conference my Government would give a special responsibility and leadership role on this question to the permanent members of the Security Council.The other important issue in the Middle East is that of Lebanon. We are encouraged that  after years of armed conflict aid the heavy toll of death and destruction  Lebanon appears to be set on the path towards a new beginning  with the cease-fire in place and the resumption of political dialogue between the -parties involved. The Arab League and its Tripartite Committee must be given due credit for the welcome turn of events in Lebanon. Their efforts must continue to receive our support and encouragement so that the recent progress in Lebanon could be built upon to achieve durable peace and unity for the country.There must also be respect for the sovereignty  independence  and territorial integrity of Lebanon  and Israel must withdraw from its so-called security zone in southern Lebanon and stop its acts of aggression against its neighbour  in compliance with Security Council resolutions.It is a matter of great satisfaction to us all that we shall soon be welcoming to our community of nations a new member  Namibia  which  following the elections to be held soon  will attain its independence after long and bitter years of struggle. Malaysia is privileged to be contributing troops to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group and to have presided over the Security Council during its adoption of resolution 629 (1989)  which  inter alia  set the date of 1 April 1989 for the implementation of the Namibia settlement plan.The road to Namibian independence has not been an easy one  and problems remain that require the continued attention and vigilance of the international community  particularly of the Security Council. The international community must continue to provide the Secretary-General with the support he needs to ensure the full and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  despite the difficult circumstances. South African manoeuvres against Namibian political parties  particularly the South West Africa People's Organization  must cease. Conditions conducive to free and fair elections and to ensuring the safety and security of all Namibians must be established in Namibia.While we are happy at the prospect of Namibia's independence  we must express our abhorrence of the continued existence of apartheid in South Africa. My Government has stated time and again that apartheid cannot be reformed. It must be totally eliminated. Apartheid is the most blatant and criminal form of racial oppression and discrimination to be found anywhere today  aid the Pretoria regime must continue to be shunned and isolated by the international community. Mandatory sanctions  including a  effective oil embargo  must continue to be imposed. Pressure should continue to be applied on South Africa to bring about a truly democratic political system based on the principles of self-determination  majority rule  and universal suffrage.Despite the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements in April 1988  Afghanistan is still embroiled in a bloody conflict that is now in its ninth year  with no prospects for peace in sight. An unpopular and unrepresentative regime that was installed by force of foreign arms continues to cling to power in Kabul. That regime should realize that peace and tranquillity in Afghanistan can only return through the process of dialogue aid the assumption of power by a popular  broad-based Government.On the Iran-Iraq situation  Malaysia is gratified that the cease-fire has kept the precarious peace and spared precious lives over the past year. However  we share the universal concern at the lack of progress towards the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  despite the best efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General. As a fraternal Islamic nation  we hope and pray that peace and tranquillity will be restored in the bilateral relations of those two Islamic nations  lb that end  we urge the two sides to continue their dialogue under the auspices of the Secretary-General  so that an early aid mutually satisfactory settlements can be realized.The situation in Cambodia remains a matter of international concern and deserves the full consideration of the General Assembly. As a neighbouring State  Malaysia is disappointed that a comprehensive political settlement  which is the only way to bring about a durable peace in Cambodia  has not been achieved. The principal components of a comprehensive political settlement have been clearly spelled out by the General Assembly. The total withdrawal of all foreign forces should be an integral part of a comprehensive political settlement. The announcement by Viet Nam of its withdrawal from Cambodia cannot be regarded as credible unless it has been verified and supervised by an effective international control mechanism. It remains Malaysia's conviction that only the United Nations can provide the necessary expertise  authority  and resources to ensure the deployment of an impartial and effective international control mechanism within the framework of a comprehensive political settlement in Cambodia.The sad state of affairs in Cambodia  resulting from foreign intervention and occupation  has unfortunately remained  it will become even worse if a solution is not found soon and if the parties concerned remain inflexible.It is most essential that there be a quadripartite interim Government under the leadership of Samdech Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia  pending the holding of internationally supervised free and fair elections. All sides must be willing to compromise. The efforts that were undertaken at the Paris International Conference must be followed up despite the impasse. The international community cannot accept an intensification of conflict  another blood-letting  or the prospect of renewed tragedy and horror. The international community  taking up where it left off in Paris  will not only need to urge the Cambodian factions to agree to an interim sharing of power  but may have to undertake collective initiatives to allow for such a necessary development.It is imperative for the General Assembly to continue to press for a comprehensive political settlement. The efforts of the members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations and others during the session are directed towards that objective. There must be effective guarantees to Cambodia's independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity  and neutral and non-aligned status.In the Korean peninsula  the desire for peaceful reunification enjoys the support of the peoples of the two Korean entities. There have been modalities proposed by both sides for such unification  and the discussions between them should contribute to the strengthening of peace and security in the peninsula and to the attainment of the final goals. Malaysia also pays close attention to any interest in membership in organizations  on the principle of universality.The unsettled situation in Central America also demands the international community's attention. Malaysia welcomes the initiatives of the five Central American Presidents  including the latest  the Tela Declaration  and the joint plan adopted in Honduras in August this year. It is out hope that all parties and countries concerned will give their close and full co-operation in the implementation of those vital decisions.Antarctica presents the international community with a welcome opportunity to accomplish multilateral co-operation of a truly universal character in pursuit of the common good of all mankind. We continue to believe that  on the basis of dialogue and cleat appreciation of the collective responsibility for the protection and preservation of this pristine continent  we can arrive at an understanding which can meet the interests of all parties.It must therefore be a matter of disappointment for all of us that we have not fully used the opportunities during the last seven years to advance our common cause despite the categorical and repeated affirmation by those that are not parties to the Treaty of their commitment to take into account all aspects pertaining to all areas covered by the treaty system.In our view  this global common  because of its unique characteristics and its significant impact on the world climate and ecosystem  must be accorded every protection against the harmful effects of man's activities  especially the exploitation of its resources. In this connection the banning of prospecting and mining and the regulation of other activities related to the exploration and uses of Antarctica are key elements in the development of an international protection regime for Antarctica  that would make this last frontier a world wilderness preserve.On the issue of disarmament  obviously the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - between the United States and the Soviet Union was an important breakthrough. It provided for the elimination of an entire class of nuclear missiles from the arsenals of the two super-Powers for the first time in history. In hailing this outstanding achievement Malaysia urges the two super-Powers to press ahead with their negotiations for a 50 per cent reduction of their strategic nuclear weapons so as to pave the way for the ultimate elimination of the nuclear threat.Unfortunately  this more positive phase in super-Power relations has not contributed much to the multilateral disarmament process. Indeed  except for some progress in the negotiations on a chemical weapons convention at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  there has been very little progress on other issues on its agenda. We would urge the parties concerned fully to exploit the potential of multilateral negotiations  particularly the Conference on Disarmament  in order to expedite the realization of a global comprehensive programme of disarmament.Malaysia believes that comprehensive nuclear disarmament can be realized only if there is agreement on a comprehensive test ban. We therefore hold the view that a nuclear test-ban treaty is an indispensable step towards nuclear disarmament. At the same time  such a treaty would help preserve the relevance and validity of the Man-Proliferation Treaty. In the absence of progress in the negotiations cm a comprehensive test ban  Malaysia supports the initiative of the group of six non-aligned countries towards the convening of a conference to transform the 1963 partial test-ban Treaty into a comprehensive test-ban treaty.My Government also believes that on the priority issue of providing ""negative security assurances"" to non-nuclear-weapon States  pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons  there should be legally binding undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States.Malaysia is deeply concerned at the increasing use of chemical weapons in regional conflicts. We are  however  encouraged by the tangible progress made in the negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament in preparing a comprehensive chemical weapons convention. We detest the use of such weapons and therefore welcome the reaffirmation of the validity of the 1925 Geneva Protocol on chemical weapons by the Paris Conference on chemical weapons held in January this year. Malaysia welcomes the proposal made recently by President George Bush of the United States pertaining to the destruction of chemical-weapon stocks. We are equally happy over the favourable response of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union to the proposal. There is a clear prospect to go further  and these steps would need to be taken by both the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to banish forever the use of such inhumane weapons of mass destruction.The other disarmament issues  my Government believes that given the rapid advances in space technology and the increasing threat of the misuse of outer space  there is an urgent need for a comprehensive regime regulating the use of outer space by the international community. It also believes that great efforts should be made at both the international and the regional levels for a limitation and regulation of the conventional arms race  including those at sea. Malaysia continues to support the creation of zones of peace and nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world and remains committed to the establishment of a zone of peace  freedom arid neutrality in South-East Asia.The international economic front  very few encouraging steps have been taken to achieve the stated goals of multilateralism  interdependence and mutual co-operation. Unfortunately  at a time when the world is on the threshold of a new century - which is indeed the dawn of a new millennium - inequities and injustices still remain in international economic relations. The aspirations of millions in the developing countries for better living standards and a more decent way of life remain unfulfilled. The depressed economic conditions arising from  inter alia  low growth rates  external indebtedness and deteriorating terms of trade in many developing countries  coupled with serious social stagnation  will only lead to a political upheaval to the detriment of their societies and peoples  and in some instances threaten the survival of nations.It should be noted that the struggle of the developing countries to find a better place in the international economic arena has become much more difficult and painful in the face of certain trends in the developed world. The developing countries cannot and should not be marginalized in any new economic environment brought about by the new situation. They must be allowed to benefit from emerging developments such as the process of integration of the industrialized economies of Western Europe into a single market within the European Economic Community. The large industrialized nations  which strike trade and financial deals among themselves  must ensure that they do not place an extra burden upon others to compete for market access and financial resources. The decisions they make must also take into consideration the interests of others  particularly among the developing countries. It is in the context of finding ways and means to ensure the harmonization of the interests of all that the United Nations should be given the appropriate role as a forum and organization for facilitating the resolution of various international economic and social problems.The United Nations can be a useful forum for addressing the various issues  including money  finance  debt  trade and development  with a view to bringing about a fair and equitable trading environment  harnessing the full development potentials of the world and encouraging economic growth and social progress world-wide. Malaysia attaches great importance to the principles of an open international trading system aid increased trade liberalization  which will be meaningless if trends towards unilateralism and protectionism are encouraged.Malaysia is heartened that serious efforts have been undertaken at the United Nations to examine the question of the revitalization of economic growth and development of the developing countries  and to deliberate upon the question of an international development strategy. The developing countries have very high expectations of these two important events. Malaysia intends to participate actively during the deliberations and we call for commitment on the part of countries at the highest level.In this age of industrialization and high technology  the environment becomes a matter of concern to everyone. It must be emphasized that the maintenance of a safe environment Is not the sole prerogative of those living in the developed countries. Regrettably  there are many self-appointed guardians of the world's environment  in the developed countries  who think that they can make the world a much safer place to live in if trees were not cut down in the tropical rain forests or if people in the developing countries were to shun modern industrial activities and amenities aid simply carry on with their traditional ways of life. In their enthusiasm to criticize others  they tend to downplay the problems of acid rain in their own countries  the pollution of their rivers and lakes  and the devastation of temperate forests resulting from decades of logging and clearing for urban expansion.Malaysia believes that on an important question such as the environment  again there should be shared responsibility. Constraints cannot be imposed on the development process in the developing countries because of fear of degradation of the environment. Just as the developed countries are trying to cope with their own environmental problems  the developing countries are conscious of the need to maintain and preserve their own environment while coping with  inter alia  poverty  hunger  social depression and  in many cases  recurrent natural disasters.  It would be most unfair if the people of the developing countries were required to stifle their own creativity and development because of mistakes made earlier in the developed countries. Malaysia believes that the United Nations could be a very useful forum in bringing about a clearer understanding of the world's environmental problems. Work in the United Nations system should be encouraged in this regard.More than a decade ago the Malaysian Government declared that drug abuse and illicit trafficking were not just a social problem. More important  to us they are issues of national security. We continue to regard them as such. We are happy that many others now share our perception. We call upon all countries to address the drug problem seriously  not only within their own borders  but also to enter into concerted and determined efforts to work towards an effective international response to the problem by every means possible.The time has come for the international community to address the question related to the serious problems and limitations of national Governments in dealing effectively with assaults by the drug empire. The United Nations  with its enhanced credibility and authority  should be able to be the central authority for determining the necessary international response in such areas as law enforcement and interdiction. My Government would support efforts to consider collectively an international authority for the United Nations that would  at the request of nations under challenge  be able to take the necessary steps.Another matter of pressing concern relates to the global refugee problem  which is further complicated by its interrelationship with political  economic  social and ideological issues. Fortunately  there have been positive developments recently. The international Conference on Central American Refugees held in Guatemala City in May this year marked an important step in identifying new solutions to the problem of refugees  returnees and displaced persons in the region. Similarly  the international Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees held in Geneva in June this year forged a new international consensus on the problem of these refugees  particularly those from Viet Nam and Laos. The unanimous adoption of a comprehensive plan of action by the Conference in Geneva demonstrated the collective will of the participants to find a lasting solution to this long-standing problem. It is our hope that the Governments concerned will be able to translate the various commitments achieved at the Conference into reality as soon as possible.Malaysia is also concerned at the exodus of people from Bulgaria into Turkey and would urge the Governments of those two neighbouring countries to enter into meaningful negotiations with a view to reaching an early and amicable solution to this humanitarian problem.The General Assembly has a full agenda before it at this session. There is a whole array of issues of serious concern to the international community. Many of the issues are not new to us  having been dealt with in this body over the years.It is my hope that at this forty-fourth session the General Assembly will be able to achieve consensus on many of these issues. It is also my hope that resolutions will not just remain resolutions to be ritually debated aid adopted year in and year out  without contributing to any tangible improvement of the human condition. Let us strive together to galvanize international action towards greater and more fruitful global co-operation. To this end my delegation pledges its fullest co-operation with you  Mr. President  aid with other national delegations in ensuring a successful and productive outcome of our deliberations."
"101",5053,"NER",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a particular pleasure for me  on behalf of the delegation of Niger  to congratulate you moat warmly on your brilliant election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. By unanimously entrusting you with the onerous task of guiding its work the Assembly has wished to testify to the active role played in the international arena by your great country  the Federal Republic of Nigeria  which is united by old  fruitful  strong and varied link with the Republic of Niger in promoting and defending the ideals of international peace  harmony and security and in striving for greater equity and justice in international economic relations.Your election is thus a confirmation of your outstanding qualities  an eminent diplomat  you are an expert in your field  a man whose experience  talent and strong convictions compel admiration and promise a fruitful outcome to our work. Finally  it is a tribute paid to Africa as a whole. I wish to assure you of the complete availability and co-operation of my delegation in helping you to accomplish your task.To your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  we would like to express out full appreciation and gratitude for the wisdom  skill and efficiency with which he presided over the work of the forty-third session.lb the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  I should like to repeat the whole-hearted support and encouragement of General Ali Saibou  President of the Supreme Council of National Guidance  Head of State  for the tireless efforts he is making on behalf of peace. We commend the dynamic work the Secretary-General has carried out at the head of this Organization  which he has now rehabilitated and whose authority  prestige and credibility he has restored.Finally  I welcome Mr. Ronald Spiers  the new Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs  who succeeds Ambassador Reed. We wish him every success in the accomplishment of his new task.The sessions of the General Assembly are opportunities for the international community to make further progress in the quest for peace  justice and harmony among peoples in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter. It is in this spirit that the delegation of Niger intends once again to make its contribution to the bread discussion of problems of concern to humanity.Swift and profound changes are taking place in the international arena. We are seeing political  economic  social  cultural and even ideological changes which are shaping and foreshadowing international relations and the new stakes and challenges of the next century. These changes are sure to have a decisive influence on the future of nations and peoples.The new dynamic in the feature of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  particularly with the signature and entry into force of the Treaty on the Elimination of Their Inter mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  is grounds for hope. That agreement and the thaw in relations between the two super-Powers has created a general climate of co-operation and detente and has helped to prepare the way for the settlement of several regional and local conflicts.The treaties and agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and the United States are basic attainments} they testify to the political will of those two countries to curb the danger which the arms race represents for mankind. We must however note that the danger continues because the means of warfare are of necessity lethal  are still considerable and are increasingly sophisticated. For that reason the two super-Powers should intensify and pursue  with greater determination and will  their negotiations on the reduction of their stockpiles both nuclear and conventional.In this respect we are pleased with the constructive proposals made a few days ago from this rostrum  by the President of the United States of America and the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs respectively  with regard to the elimination of chemical weapons and of conventional weapons. These proposals  if accepted by both parties  would  we believe  help to promote substantial progress towards general and complete disarmament.The survival of mankind is our common responsibility and implies that we must avoid a nuclear disaster  which is still possible  by significantly reversing present trends. It is certainly frustrating to note the state of the world today and to see that today we have a striking if not repugnant paradox on the one hand there is the exponential increase in military budgets  and arsenals and on the other there is the chronic poverty and wretchedness of many in the world We must give full weight to the Action Programme adopted by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development  which provides for the creation of institutional financial mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of resources saved through disarmament measures to economic and social development activities.This session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when significant and encouraging progress has been noted in many regional conflicts  some of which have been controlled and virtually settled thanks to the merits of dialogue and negotiation  while others are on the right path with good chances of success. However  the persistence of stubborn hotbeds of tension or situations of injustice and the appearance or intensification of certain disputes still pose a dangerous threat to international peace and security in many regions of the world.We must work tirelessly  and persevere in the quest for and consolidation of peace. He must take advantage of this thaw in international relations to make significant advances towards the realization of our peoples' legitimate aspiration to peace  justice and human dignity.In Africa  the situation in Namibia and South Africa continues to centre on the long-awaited outcome of the Namibian people's heroic struggle for independence and on tine persistence of the despicable system of apartheid. The international community's tireless efforts are finally about to bear fruits the implementation of the independence plan for Namibia has been under way since 1 April 1989. Yet it is more indispensable than ever before to show determination  vigilance and solidarity to prevent the Pretoria racist regime from crushing our efforts.Unfortunately  I must condemn yet again tine intimidation and harassment against the freedom-fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SHAFO)  the reprisals perpetrated by the sinister Koevoet forces  the manipulation of electoral rolls  the assassination of Namibian patriots and SHAFO leaders  such as the 12 September murder of Anton Lubowski. All these acts testify to the disarray of the racist regime and remind us that there are still many real dangers that the process will be derailed  and that constant vigilance is required.It is the duty of the Organization  the permanent members of the Security Council and the entire international community to ensure that the spirit and the letter of Security Council resolutions 435 (1578) and 632 (1989) are scrupulously respected by all parties and that the Namibian people has the opportunity and means to elect a Government of Its choice next month freely  peacefully and without manoeuvres  intimidation or coercion.In South Africa itself  apartheid persists  The new political leadership of the country is aiming to win time through various subterfuges. He must not be Misled by recent declarations of purely superficial constitutional reforms or by the pseudo-elections of 6 September last. They leave untouched the real problem: the perpetuation of the apartheid system  which denies the black majority the right to participate fully in the political and democratic management of its country.Mr. President  as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid you are very well aware that apartheid cannot be reformed. It is a disgrace to humanity and an anachronism of world civilization; it must be dismantled  pure and simple. But we note that the friends of the South African regime still hesitate to adopt bold sanctions against the apartheid regime. They must understand and weigh the danger to themselves of stubborn support - even passive support - for a system founded on inequality  exploitation and the denial of human rights.For that reason  Niger appeals again to the international community to maintain and indeed increase its pressure on the South African regime  so the comprehensive mandatory sanctions ordered by the Security Council and the General Assembly in the relevant resolutions can be effectively imposed against South Africa. Only such sanctions will make it see reason and lift its policy of internal repression and destabilization of neighbouring States  lift the bans that hobble the anti-apartheid movement  and immediately and unconditionally free all political prisoners  including Nelson Mandela  Today more than ever before  this is a matter of a true social pact and a duty of genuine solidarity for the international community vis-Ã -vis the South African people and all the peoples of southern Africa.We call on the international community to support fully the conclusions reached by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  which met at Harare on 21 August and adopted a declaration on the peace process in southern Africa. We call on it firmly to support the Gbadolite agreements of 22 June last and all the efforts to restore peace in Angola  and to encourage similar initiatives for national reconciliation and the restoration of peace in Mozambique A local conflict that has just exploded on our continent is causing us great concern and sadness  for it concerns two fraternal countries that are dear to us two countries that should stand united and cleave to one another; two countries members of the organization for the Development of the Senegal River  the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel  the West African Economic Community  the Economic Community of West African States  the OAU  the organization of the Islamic Conference and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.As a member of the ministerial mediation commission established by the organization of African Unity  Niger is working with the other member countries towards the prompt and final settlement of this unfortunate affair. We therefore take this opportunity to renew our appeal to Senegal and Mauritania to refrain from any action that could increase tension  and to co-operate fully with the African mediation commission in its efforts to restore as soon as possible between the two peoples the understanding  harmony  fraternity  solidarity and common destiny to which geography  history and the Islamic faith destine - I was about to say doom - them.I am pleased to note that between Chad and Libya - two other fraternal countries that are neighbours of Niger - dialogue is continuing and strengthening ever time  thus promoting a comprehensive  final settlement of the dispute that has long set them against one another and that has cost their peoples so dearly. Niger welcomed the conclusion on 31 August of the Algiers agreement  which consolidated the cease-fire and ushered in a new era of peace  mutual trust and fraternalco-operation for the two countries. We congratulate them and urge them to sustain this momentum in the interest of their peoples arid the entire sub region.In Western Sahara  the process begun by the Secretary-General's peace plan and conducted jointly with the current Chairman of the OAU is under way  and we support it. We urge the parties involved in this painful conflict to continue and indeed intensify their efforts to create conditions that would favour the organization under United Nations auspices of a referendum on self-determination.In the Middle East  the Palestinian people is heroically continuing its resistance to illegal occupation and repression. The conditions  the framework and the means for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East are well known. They include the total and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Arab territories  including Jerusalem  the strict implementation in that connection of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and the convoking under United Nations auspices of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and  on an equal footing  of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). There is no possible alternative to those conditions and their complete implementation} otherwise there can be no fair and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.Along with the rest of the international community  Niger welcomed the peace initiative announced on 13 December 1988 in Geneva  and the many peaceful overtures made by the PLO. We therefore regret the lack of a positive response from the Israeli Government to the Palestinian side's constructive position. None the less  we hope that both sides will show realism and responsibility by accepting the 10-point proposal put forward by the President of Egypt  Mr. Hosni Mubarak  we feel that proposal could create conditions for a constructive and satisfactory outcome. In the meantime  we urgently appeal for strict respect for the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  in order to protect civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories against the repression practised by the Israeli forces trying - vainly - to stifle the intifadah.We continue to be concerned by the tragedy the people of Lebanon has endured for the past 15 years. A State Member of this Organization is truly wasting away. Can we remain powerless and inactive in the face of that unacceptable situation? The international community must do everything in its power to preserve the identity  unity  territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon  and to achieve national reconciliation amongst all its sons. Niger is endeavouring to do this. We support fully the efforts made by the League of Arab States and the Tripartite Committee which it set up to find a solution to this tragedy.We are pleased to note that there has been a real abatement in the conflict between Iran and Iraq over the last year. My country again declares its support for the clear-sighted efforts made by the Secretary-General and urges the two parties to co-operate fully with him  not only to consolidate the cease-fire but also to make progress towards a comprehensive  just and lasting settlement to the conflict on the basis of Security Council resolution 598 (1987).Regarding Afghanistan  Niger is pleased at the conclusion of the Geneva Agreements  which made possible the withdrawal of foreign troops from that countryâ We reaffirm our support for the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his efforts to facilitate a comprehensive  political settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva agreements and General Assembly resolution 43/20. The return to real peace in Afghanistan requires strict respect for the right of the Afghan people to decide independently its own fate  and requires respect for its sovereignty  its territorial integrity and of its status as a non-aligned State.We are also watching closely the development of the situation in Kampuchea  particularly the decision on the withdrawal of foreign troops from that country. The International Conference held in Paris from 30 July to 3 August 1989  offers  in my delegation's view  a timely opportunity for ail the parties involved and directly concerned to find  through dialogue and reflection  a comprehensive  honourable and definitive solution to the tragedy of Cambodia.Even if the results of that Conference did not measure up to the hopes we had placed in them  the Conference is certainly an important step towards a peaceful solution. The Cambodian people must be able to determine freely their own destiny without any foreign interference. Dialogue amongst all the sons of Cambodia must continue and must be intensified. In this respect Niger welcomes and encourages the commendable efforts made by the French and Indonesian Co-Chairmen.The aspirations of the Korean people for peaceful reunification are yet to be realized. We strongly encourage the two parties to continue the contacts and the dialogue which they have begun with a view to the reunification of Korea without foreign interference. In regard to Cyprus we are pleased with the efforts made by the Secretary-General through his Special Representative. The independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of the island must be guaranteed and its national unity and non-aligned status must be respected.Concerning Central America we are following and we welcome the praiseworthy efforts made by the Presidents of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua to eliminate the combined impact of tension and violence and to establish the basis for true peace and co-operation. From the Contadora Agreements to those of Tesoro Beach and Tela  together with the Esquipulas II Agreements  we can gauge the determination with which the heads of State of the region are seeking means to establish a true peace. All of their initiatives and their efforts deserve the full support of this Assembly.They deserve it all the more since a terrible scourge which is afflicting all of humanity and jeopardizing the fabric of society  has over the last few months and in a brutal way  focused world attention on this region of the world. Indeed  the fight against drug trafficking in Latin America has become total war  the outcome of which will determine the capacity of the international community to display strength  determination and solidarity. This challenge involves  without any doubt  the fate and future of mankind as a whole.Niger gives its support to Colombia and to all countries involved in this battle  world-wide  and urges the international community to set in motion a consistent strategy to win this struggle  which involves and challenges us all.Another problem  indeed another scourge  which is equally disturbing and whose innocent victims are increasing in numbers throughout the world  is that of international terrorism. Last year. Pan Am flight 103  from London to New York  crashed in Scotland  with several hundreds of victims  including the United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia. On behalf of Niger  we pay a tribute once again to his memory. A few months ago Colonel Higgins  a man working for peace  was assassinated in cold blood. Recently  an aircraft of the UTA company  on a flight between Brazzaville and Paris  exploded in mid-air over territory of my country  killing 171 innocent victims. These are only a few examples  but unfortunately there are many others. On behalf of President Ali Saibou and the people of Niger  I express here to all the States whose nationals perished in the tragedy of this UTA flight our deep sympathy and our sincere condolences.Terrorism is the evil of our century. It strikes out blindly and indiscriminately. He must launch a real  unified crusade  a sacred union even  to combat terrorism  which today transcends national borders and political and ideological differences. Niger and its government are determined to make their contribution  however modest  to the struggle  which affects us all.The present climate of detente  which has prevailed for at least a year in international relations  should encourage the world to reflect further on the waysand means of restoring peace wherever it has been disturbed  to preserve it everywhere it is threatened  and to strengthen it wherever it has been established.The period of calm in the political arena is contrasted  however  very sharply with the world economic situation characterized  unfortunately  by a profound structural imbalance. In fact  unequal development between North and South is the main contradiction in the world today. It is clear however that peace and security are directly linked with development. Thus the climate of detente which prevails at this time in the world would be vain and have no future if the developing countries continue to have to deal with difficulties which are constantly aggravated through imbalance  inequality and flagrant injustice in their economic relations with the industrialized countries.The gap between developed countries and developing countries is widening day by day. Whereas in the North there is talk of growth and expansion  in the South the talk is still about food self-sufficiency and structural adjustment. Men  women and children of Africa  of Asia  and of Latin America and the Caribbean  are living through the tragedy of hunger  poverty  illiteracy  natural disasters such as drought  desertification  plaques of locusts  cyclones  and so on. Societies that are just surviving  societies that are overwhelmed: that is the harsh reality of developing countries  of which  sadly  Africa has the greatest number.The causes of this trend are to be found essentially in the collapse in commodity prices  the deterioration in terms of trade and the crushing weight of external debt. These phenomena  which have led to a net transfer of resources from developing to developed countries  and the multilateral financial institutions  are stripping States in the South of every chance of development  thus making them incapable of creating the investments necessary for real and lasting growth.Given this situation  our Governments have undertaken profound economic reforms. These reforms  carried out at great social and political cost  have not enjoyed  as was hoped and promised  the full support of the international community. Less than two years from the time it was  theoretically  to come to an end  the five-year United Nations programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has still not really started.As the Secretary-General stressed in his annual report on the work of the organization  failure to find a solution could lead to a collapse of the social and political structures in many developing countries.Whatever the case  it is urgently necessary that particular attention be given to the most vulnerable countries: the least developed countries  countries affected by drought and desertification  countries suffering from natural scourges and countries suffering from being land-locked  for whom a revival of economic and social development is a necessity.First  new and lasting solutions to the problem oÂ£ debt must be found through continuing consideration by and co-operation between creditor and debtor countries in all appropriate forums. In this regard  Niger welcomes the plans and initiatives so far put forward and supports the idea of an international conference on Africa's external debt  as advocated by the organization of African Unity. We welcome the decisions first of Canada  in 1987  and then of France this year  followed by those of Belgium and Italy  to cancel all debt relating to development assistance. Niger hopes - and this is our interest in an international conference on the debt - that those unilateral actions will be followed by collective measures  the fruit of a general and formal agreement between debtor countries and their creditor partners  both bilateral and multilateral.Secondly  we must make a methodical and determined search for a new  more just and balanced international economic order in which economic and social security is guaranteed to all peoples. That new international economic order can be sought and achieved only within the framework of the North-South dialogue  which must be resumed.In the same context we welcome and firmly support the proposal made in July 1989 by the Presidents of Egypt  Senegal and Venezuela and the Prime Minister of India concerning the organization of regular summit consultations between North and South on problems of common interest to the two hemispheres.In this connection  the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular the revitalisation of economic growth and development in developing countries  to be held in April 1990  will constitute  we believe  a propitious occasion and an appropriate framework for the reinvigoration of the North-South dialogue. This applies also to the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held in Paris in 1990.We cherish the hope that these conferences and initiatives will contribute to the effective resumption of the North-South dialogue by offering the possibility of achieving an agreement on the nature of the problems facing developing countries and the approach to be taken towards solving them. Niger intends to participate actively and to make its contribution through concrete proposals that could lead to the emergence of a new era of healthy co-operation between North and South.Moreover  we are particularly interested in the current negotiations on the new Lome convention  which in our view should serve as a model both as regards efforts to stabilize the export earnings of developing countries  assistance in the diversification of their exports and the opening of markets to their products  and as regards development assistance.1 should like to conclude this section by expressing a concern that is widely shared by the countries represented here. I refer to the problem of children.The difficult economic situation in developing countries is the reason for the situation of children in those countries  and particularly in Africa being so worrying  despite the importance and priority which our Governments accord to the protection and well-being of children  since they represent the future.The results of efforts made by members of the international community  with the assistance of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international organizations  to ensure the survival  protection and full development of the potential of children are encouraging. It is essential  however  to pursue and intensify our efforts collectively. That is why Niger firmly supports not only the idea of convening with urgency a world summit devoted to children  but also the conclusion and adoption as a top priority by the General Assembly at the present session of a draft convention on the rights of the child. The environment crisis  which is felt throughout the world and seriously threatens life on our planet  is a question to which the international community should pay urgent attention. Today  the degradation of the ozone layer  the heating of the atmosphere and climatic changes are as much a reality as deforestation  desertification of arable lands  pollution of water and the atmosphere  the disappearance of fauna and flora  toxic wastes  and the transfer of hazardous wastes to developing countries.The means of avoiding ecological disaster exist. We must use the available technology  improve it  and share it. To this end  it is imperative that Member States draw up co-ordinated plans of action to resolve the environmental crisis. That is a joint responsibility that calls for solidarity and it must be said that it is the duty of the industrialized countries to prevent or limit the damage caused to the world environment and to help our developing countries to achieve healthy development.The United Nations conference on environment and development proposed for 1992 will provide an excellent opportunity to work out agreed action at the world level and to define new principles of international law concerning the protection and conservation of the environment and  in particular  effective international measures to prohibit the transfer of hazardous wastes to the territories of other countries.As everybody knows and as is true of many African countries  the economic and social situation is the main and constant source of concern for the Government of Niger. Nevertheless  I am happy to inform the Assembly that President Ali Saibou has undertaken action aimed at the political evolution of our country with the ultimate objective of a return to constitutional life. Following the adoption by referendum of the National Charter in July 1987  the process of setting up apolitical system as the basis for the Second Republic of Niger entered its final  decisive phase with the establishment  in May 1989  of the National Movement for the Society in Development and the adoption by referendum on 24 September of a new Constitution.As the President  General Ali Saibou  said  the National Movement for the Society in Development will be the appropriate forum for political expression in which the women and men of Niger will strive to affirm and defend their political  economic and social rights. The goal is the realization of participatory democracy guaranteeing the free expression of ideological opinions and sentiments  in order to achieve a constructive political awareness and the consolidation of a stable and integrated regime involving all the components of our nation.The Constitution reaffirms the law character and republican nature of the State and makes Niger a State of law that respects the fundamental freedoms of individuals. It ensures the equality of all before the law and enshrines the principle of the sovereignty of the people.In that Constitution the people of Niger reaffirms its will to co-operate in friendship with all peoples that cherish peace  justice and freedom. It reiterates its total and permanent readiness to seek  with all the nations of the world  solutions to the innumerable ills that afflict the international community and to construct a world of peace  justice and progress in accordance with the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.Legislative and presidential elections will take place on 10 December next  with direct universal suffrage  and will complete the process of a return to normal constitutional life in Niger.That is my delegation's contribution to the general debate at the forty-fourth session  which we wish the most outstanding success. We hope that it will  strengthen the unshakable faith of our Governments in the ideals and objectives of the United Nations. We hope that it will instil in each of our peoples a planetary patriotism thanks to which we shall be able to succeed in our. undertaking and build slowly but surely a single  indivisible world of peace  happiness and human dignity.

"102",5098,"NGA",44,1989,"ï»¿It is with great pleasure that I congratulate you  a compatriot and comrade-in-arms  on your unanimous election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-fourth session.On behalf of my President  the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  His Excellency General Ibrahim Badamasi Babanqida  and the Government and the people of Nigeria  I want to thank the Member States of this august Assembly for electing Major-General Joseph Nanven Garba  our Permanent Representative  as President. In particular  I wish to pay tribute to the African Group and to place on record the gratitude of my Government to the Governments of Cameroon and Egypt for facilitating the African consensus which led to your unanimous election. I also salute the Caribbean Group for its support. Your election to this esteemed office at this time is as much a recognition of Nigeria's role in international affairs as it is a tribute to your sterling qualities.I also pay tribute to your predecessor in office  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  for the exemplary manner in which he guided the affairs of this Assembly during the forty-third session.I should also like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of my delegation to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who has  once again  piloted our organization through the rough waters of international relations in the past year.The tasks before you  Mr. President  are many and challenging. You have the responsibility of building upon the rich traditions and challenges associated with the conduct of the General Assembly. We are confident that under your guidance our organization will rekindle the hopes and aspirations of mankind for a peaceful world. We have witnessed significant changes in international relations in recent years. There is need for us  as the United Nations  to respond to this emerging situation in a manner that offers opportunities in resolving problems in the critical areas of international peace  security and development.At no time in the recent past has there been greater hope for peace than now. Super-Power relations have become less frosty. There has been modest progress in disarmament negotiations. While tensions have not been completely eliminated  the serious threats of a major conflict have receded. This improvement in the international political climate must  however  be simultaneously accompanied by an equal emphasis on urgent and effective solutions to the non-military threats to the security of the developing countries. We must ensure that no section of the international community feels excluded from the benefits arising from the new spirit of international co-operation.The African continent  where the general situation is deteriorating at an alarming rate  has that feeling of exclusion  and justifiably so. National economies have been gravely weakened  especially by the crippling debt burden  setting in reverse the living standards of our peoples. While we have made courageous structural adjustment sacrifices  the expected international support has either turned out to be a trickle or even non-ex is tent. The vital sectors of health  education and other social infrastructure have suffered immeasurably. The consequence of all this is the increasing impoverishment  marginalization and alienation of the African continent. We do not believe that this augurs well for international peace and security. It is a sombre situation that must not continue into the last decade of this century. The response to this challenge calls for a new imagination and resourcefulness  new approaches and a new resolve on the part of us all.There continue to be a marked contrast between the sense of relative accomplishment and progress on international political questions and the lack of progress in international economic issues. While the economies of the industrialized countries have enjoyed unprecedented growth  the economies of developing countries  as a group  have continued to stagnate and decline. On the critical question of the external debt of developing countries  there has been some movement from preoccupation with short-term crisis management to the recognition of the need for reduction of the staggering debt stock and its servicing. As promising as the debt reduction process seen  we are concerned not only about the inadequate resources committed to it  but also that some Governments and commercial banks are hesitant to participate in it. Universal participation by the Governments of such industrialized countries and their commercial banks is essential if the benefits of debt reduction are to be spread to all indebted countries.But today  substantial resources needed to promote growth and development have been used up to service debt. The debt crisis has been transformed into a growth crisis. In the heavily indebted countries  growth has faltered as have investment and per capita consumption. The appalling economic conditions of the indebted countries leave us in no doubt that there is need for strong international support for those countries. It was for these reasons that my President  General Ibrahim Babanqida  put forward at the ninth summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  a number of important proposals regarding the debt question  which I now commend to the Assembly  as follows:""(a) All official debts owed to creditor countries in bilateral transactions  should qualify for outright cancellation by the creditor countries involved. This proposal has been made to take account of the generalized poverty of developing countries which is manifested in the weak and persisting primary structures and mono-cultural nature of their economies;Regarding debts owed to the Bretton Woods institutions  that is  the IMP and the World Bank  a few devices should be considered to bring relief to debt-distressed developing  particularly  sub-Saharan African  countries: (1) 50 per cent of the resources under the IDA-9th Replenishment should be made available to African countries. (2) Resources under the Structural Adjustment Fund (SAP) of the IMF  and the sub-Saharan African Facility of the World Bank  should be made available to countries with overdue debt service obligations to the two institutions. Repurchases can then be undertaken by the affected countries  with the advantage of enjoying the relief inherent in those facilities;""(c) Regarding debts owed to commercial banks  an international debt purchasing institution or agency should be set up under the aegis of the IMF and the World Bank to purchase the existing debt of developing countries at substantial discounts of up to 80 per cent. The transactions could be financed partly with voluntary contributions from developed countries and also with uncommitted resources under the specialized facilities of the World Bank and the IMF with low or no conditionality attached.""The economic situation in Africa is particularly grave. African countries remain highly vulnerable to adverse trends in weather and the international economic environment. They did not benefit from the price surge and expansion of world trade in 1988.In general  African countries have faired badly in the 1980s. The cumulative trade deficit stood at $57 billion as of 1988. Africa's external debt rose from S128 billion in 1982 to .1230 billion in 1988  which is approximately 82 per cent of total regional gross domestic product and represents 314 per cent of exports of goods and services.That Africa's economic situation has worsened at a time when many African countries have embarked on economic policy reforms  is evidence that policy reforms are  by themselves  no guarantee of growth and development  unless they are adequately financed. That the international economic environment continues to be harsh on the African countries is further proof that the commitments made by the international community to support Africa in the context of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development are far from being fulfilled.I submit that both the premise and the practice of international co-operation for development would be most severely tested in Africa in the 1990s  as medium-term prospects for the continent appear less bright than in other regions. Sustained international support for the economies of African countries is most urgent if we are to resume growth and development. In this regard  Nigeria welcomes  as part of the solution to the problem  the recommendation of the Independent Group on Financial Flows to Developing Countries  the Schmidt Commission  that major surplus countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  should establish a 31 billion Endowment Fund to be administered by the African Development Bank (ADB) to provide debt relief measures and further increase official development assistance to the region.The international community - particularly the industrialized nations among us - must utilize the opportunity afforded by the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation in April 1990  to give fresh impetus to development co-operation.The environmental degradation consequent upon modern technological and industrial developments has been causing great concern. Indeed  there are some who are already positing that environmental issues may well dominate the decade of the 1990s. However  the problem cannot be solved by shifting environmental degradation from one part of the world to other unsuspecting parts. Nor will a neglect of the requirements of one part  while concentrating on those of another  provide an effective global solution.In this connection  the dumping of toxic wastes in developing countries  especially in Africa  constitutes a serious danger to the lives of our people and to the environment. My delegation calls on the international community to intensify its effort to prohibit this unwholesome practice. We urge the United Nations to adopt the Dump Watch for effective action against indiscriminate waste dumping.On the subject of international efforts to clean up the environment  I should like to underline the need for a global vision that does not neglect the developing countries. International co-operation for preventing and countering the devastating effects of flooding  desertification  sudden weather changes  water pollution  to mention a few  can be as important in some countries as are measures aimed at the restoration of the ozone layer.Countries are now being urged to pursue the path of environmentally sound and sustainable development. Adequate financial resources  as well as technical and technological assistance  need to be provided to the developing countries to enable them to reinforce their policies of environmental protection. It is equally important that policy prescriptions and measures for alleviating environmental degradation are not directed at developing countries alone  nor environmental criteria made a condition for extending the requisite assistance to them. It is recognized that there is a direct linkage between the prevention of environmental degradation and development in developing countries. We believe it is in the interest of the technologically advanced nations to invest in developing countries in the critical areas of water resources  erosion control  reforestation and alternative sources of energy  to mention just a few. That will assist in preserving the ecosystem world-wide.In the field of human rights  Nigeria commends the continued and untiring efforts by all exponents of those basic rights and freedoms. As the international community this year celebrates the twentieth anniversary of the Declaration on Social Progress and Development (General Assembly resolution 2542 (XXIV))  Nigeria notes the work of the Committee which over the past decade has been working on the draft convention of the rights of the child  we hope that the proposed convention will be adopted by consensus.The situation in southern Africa remains a source of serious concern. Racist South Africa persists in its aggression and policy of destabilization of its neighbours. The present situation in that country must be viewed with great circumspection. A new President elected under the apartheid system  which denies 28 million black people constituting more than 70 per cent of the population the right to vote  has been making statements intended to project the image of a reformer. It was only a few years ago that the former President of the apartheid regime announced  with a fanfare  impending reforms. The result was a constitutional sham that did not address the basic problem of the inhuman South African system. If this new apartheid President has begun his regime by speaking the language of peaceful change  we have every right to say to him: We have heard all this before; we are not impressed.  Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia on 1 April 1989 - have been resolved. None the less we are concerned about the climate of intimidation and terror that still exists in Namibia  and especially about the activities of the Koevoet units  some of which have been absorbed into the regular police force. We demand their immediate removal. As a measure of our support of the transition process  Nigeria is contributing police personnel and electoral monitors as well as rendering financial and other assistance.At this critical period we call on the international community to remain vigilant so as to ensure the integrity of the United Nations in the implementation of the Namibian independence plan. That is required in the face of calculated attempts by racist South Africa to manipulate the transition programme. We are particularly concerned about the inherent perfidy of the proclamations of the Electoral Constituent Assembly. We insist the elections be free and fair  as envisaged in the enabling Security Council resolutions. Until independence is achieved Namibia remains the responsibility of the Organization. The United Nations cannot afford to disappoint Africa and the world. For this last colony on the continent of Africa so much is at stake  not only for Namibia and Namibians but also for peace and stability in all of southern Africa.An independent Namibia will require considerable assistance. It is in recognition of that fact that  even in these difficult times  Nigeria has rallied to the support of the brotherly people of Namibia. As a demonstration of our commitment to the cause of the freedom and independence of Namibia  Nigeria launched  on 16 June 1989  a Namibia Solidarity Fund of 100 million naira to assist the new State at independence. We urge the international community to rise to the challenge and render all possible assistance to the Namibian people.On Cambodia and Central America  the international community must persist in the search for a durable peace. We support the ongoing initiatives for attaining this objective  including those undertaken within their respective regional frameworks.By the same token  Nigeria supports the efforts towards peaceful unification on the Korean peninsula. It is noteworthy that in spite of their present circumstances the Korean people have  in various ways  made significant contributions to international understanding and co-operation. The international community will benefit even more from the admission of the Koreans into the United Nations and other international organizations of their choice.Nigeria will continue to contribute significantly to reaching the objectives of general and complete disarmament under effective international control. The arms race threatens international peace and security and still constitutes an unacceptable diversion of resources which could better serve the cause of world-wide economic and social development. We therefore note with satisfaction the current bilateral negotiations between the super-Powers. This should lead to deep reductions and  subsequently  total elimination of nuclear and chemical weapons. However  the abiding general interest of our community demands that the multilateral disarmament machinery be involved in the process of negotiating disarmament agreements.There was once an Africa strong and adventurous. That glorious past is adequately chronicled. Later Africa became the victim of actions to which the continent was not a party. That past also belongs to history. On the eve of the last decade of this century we in Africa are determined never again to be marginalized in any area of human endeavour. The international community should respond positively to Africa's yearnings for co-operation and development. We believe that on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility foe the destiny of our planet Africa can offer a credible partnership for a better and snore prosperous world.The developed world must appreciate our common humanity and adopt policies that will eliminate the present yawning gap between the privileged and the underprivileged. It is our hope that through the instrumentality of the United Nations mankind's aspirations to fairness  justice and equity will be achieved. We look forward to an international system that eliminates the present reality  in which a large section of humanity is economically and politically under represented. For in a world of persistent inequity there is no guarantee for peace  stability and progress. It must be borne in mind that no one is secure until all are secure in an increasingly interdependent global village. However  there comes a time when a people  no matter how embattled  must take its future into its own hands. That journey must begin now. The African train is on the move: we must rebuild Africa.Our vision is of an Africa whose dignity and independence will be reinforced by the birth of a free and sovereign Namibia-  an Africa free of the scourges of apartheid; an Africa that will direct its energies to the urgent development needs of its peoples-  an Africa that will uphold the rights and defend the interests of people of African descent wherever they may be-  an Africa that will have the courage  the will and the determination to summon the creative ingenuity and acknowledged resourcefulness of its people; an Africa that will make a major contribution to and use advances in science and technology to enhance its productive capacity and development. It is  above all  a vision of a self-confident Africa in which democracy and human rights will flourish. "
"103",5143,"NIC",44,1989,"ï»¿Let me begin by congratulating Ambassador Garba on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. I should like also to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his devoted and productive work as head of this Organization. Furthermore  I take this opportunity to express to Mr. Dante Caputo our appreciation for the work he did as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session.To a country like Nicaragua - attacked  impoverished and drained of blood by almost a decade of illegal  unjust and immoral war - it is encouraging to hear voices of peace  democracy and detente. Let us hope that these encouraging signs will shortly be translated into reality - a reality in which peace is  as it must be  synonymous with respect for individual and collective human rights and with strict observance of the civil and political as well as the economic  social and cultural rights of individuals and peoples.A people such as mine  which has honourably and courageously defended its dignity and has turned the hitherto abstract concepts of self-determination and sovereignty into reality  has every right to expect a better world for all. We have every right to dream and to believe that our dreams can come true  we have every right to believe and to feel that there is a dream at the root of every possibility  and a utopia at the origin of every reality. Just as regional conflicts can carry the terrifying seed of a new and final world-wide conflagration  each one of them - no matter what its causes o;Â· intentions - contains sufficient universal ingredients and elements for the whole to be seen in any one of its parts. Our times and their principal tendencies and expressions demonstrate that the centre of the world can be located anywhere.If that is so in the case of the painful experience of war  it is equally true of other expressions  culture  art  philosophy  literature - all of which are flourishing today in places that were considered  until new  to be peripheral  and all of which have acquired undeniable universal value. It would seem - and here  inevitably  history recalls Hegel and the phenomenology of the spirit - that the universal realizes itself only in the particular.In that sense  the world is becoming eccentric  and unity - that is  the fullest expression of the loftiest values of the spirit and of the highest human qualities - can be attained only through the co-ordination and harmonious articulation of each and every one of its component parts.The mass media have made the world a smaller place  the universe more provincial  and the provincial more universal. No matter how far away they may occur  all developments become part of our province. At the same time  nothing that happens on our soil fails to affect the entire world community. The United Nations is at the high point of this ebb and flow of human events. That is why it is of such extraordinary importance  in this effort  to co-ordinate and harmoniously articulate the political life of our times. If the usefulness of the United Nations since the end of the Second World War need not be demonstrated since it is self-evident  its usefulness or rather its necessity is all the more inevitable in this contemporary world moving forward at a blinding speed  a world in which the technological revolution coexists with processes of decolonization and national liberation wars  one in which  judging by current symptoms  seems to be passing from confrontation to co-existence and  perhaps  to co-operation.We have heard a great deal of talk  from this very rostrum  from some of the world's most important leaders about an easing of tensions and dialogue between the super-Powers  about disarmament proposals  the beginning of solutions to regional conflicts  and of the possible emergence of a multipolar world.We naturally welcome the reshaping of international relations  but on the other hand political detente must be accompanied by economic co-operation. If that does not come about  the contradiction between North and South will sooner or later explode into conflicts not unlike current ones  or they may take on different forms.It must also be understood that international co-operation is an objective necessity  and should not be seen as charity or a gracious concession. Planetary co-development is imperative for human survival. Development can no longer bypass  or take place at the expense of  the poor nations. Peace will never coexist with misery  injustice and exploitation.The wretched of the Earth  as Franz Fanon so tightly called them  also inhabit out planet  and they live and dream. They are the owners of a past rich in history  culture and values  and they have every right to a future compatible with dignity. Filled with hope  we welcome the new climate of dialogue and understanding. But at the same time we must point out the gaps and loopholes whose negative significance is more qualitative than quantitative.We believe that the moment has come to take into account each and every aspect of our complex modern world. Not to do so would be a mistake  as would interpreting the easing of tensions and the possible end of the cold war as the disappearance of all contradictions and the  td of history itself.Consensus does not mean sanctifying a given ideology  but rather the coexistence of different forms of thought and political systems  Universality is not homogeneity  universality is unity in diversity. Those who rush to proclaim the end of ideology are in no way neutral. In fact  they ate proclaiming their own ideology in disguise. Those who explicitly or implicitly try to portray the changes taking place in today's world and the new climate of detente as the universal consecration of capitalist economics and political liberalism are committing a basic conceptual error that could lead  in short order  to misguided political practices. It would be far better to understand things as they are  objectively and without braggadocio. Pragmatism and tolerance are needed in order to accept differences and to make sure that they coexist.In our judgement  it is imperative that those philosophical arid political premises be understood and accepted in order for there to be hope for an end to the cold war and regional conflicts  and for there to be a possibility of entering a new era of peace  development and co-operation in a world in which inevitable differences of opinion not only coexist but stimulate understanding  solidarity and justice among all the peoples of the Earth. Nicaragua  a nation of 3.5 million inhabitants located in the middle of Central America  has had close to 60 000 victims in a war of aggression that has lasted almost a decade.Ours is a country that has endured three foreign military occupations in this century and one in the last. It has carried out a revolution whose essence and reason for being is  first and foremost  the recovery of identity and the restructuring of the nation. Against that background  and taking into account that Nicaragua is part of a region - Central America - that has been the scene of one of the most intense conflicts of our time  it is understandable that we are interested in seeing historical event interpreted fairly and precisely  even in matters seemingly of no concern to small countries  matters traditionally the exclusive province of the great Powers. That is why we demand the right to participate  from the perspective of our own conditions  as subjects and beneficiaries of contemporary history.We believe that the attainment of full democracy continues to be the most important foundation upon which to build a more just and human world. We believe that democracy is the best system of human co-operation and the best form of social and political organization. We believe in democracy in its juridical and formal sense  in representative democracy based on universal suffrage  the rule of law and the separation of powers. But we also know that a democracy limited to normative and institutional forms is a partial and relative democracy. That is why it is necessary to round out the concept and practice of participatory democracy  in which all members of society  and not just the privileged classes  have access to the material and spiritual assets of the community. Moreover  taking into account the interdependence of the world in which we live  full democracy can be achieved in a country only when it is also a reality in the system of international relations. In order for full democracy to be possible it is necessary to eliminate the use of force to attack others. The principles of self-determination and sovereignty of peoples must be respected. The norms of international law must be observed  and the rulings of the International Court of Justice obeyed  so that conflicts can be resolved peacefully and peace and equilibrium reign world-wide.Democracy is hurt by the current system of international economic relations  by unfair terms of trade  by the prices paid on world markets foe goods produced by the poor nations  by trade embargos  and other coercive economic measures used as instruments of political pressure. It is dishonest to set oneself up as an immaculate judge of the faults of others  while poor peoples are being exploited in international trade and economic relations end foreign debt and usurious interest rates choke off our peoples' possibilities of survival  depriving them of their destinies and their futures. We cannot successfully bring our struggle for democracy to an end until there is a new ethical system in the world.For us  democracy equals human rights both individual and collective  they are a concept and a practice in which the dignity of each human being and of each people must be fully reconciled and realized. The two  necessarily  go hand in hand ; we cannot conceive of any real possibility of one existing without the other  still less of one being against the other r Nor do we accept that one can be used as a pretext for evading the other  as there is no reason of State however weighty  that can justify degrading a human being physically or morally or for not respecting his dignity and integrity. Nor is there any possible justification for attacking a people in the name of democracy and attempting to violate its sovereignty and its right to self-determination. Nor is there any justification for speculating with poverty and trafficking in necessities in the name of the free market. We do not believe in freedom founded on the oppression arid exploitation of others. We do not accept the freedom of the fox given the run of the henhouse.Nicaragua has proposed that international agencies specializing in human rights should be made responsible for verifying that human rights are being observed in each of the countries in Central America. We believe that this approach is much more appropriate than any s el f-monitoring procedure.Central America is still experiencing the most serious crisis in its history. The Central American crisis  which began to take shape several decades ago  has its roots in poverty  underdevelopment and exploitation  and in the fact that its peoples - like the peoples of other regions - have been relegated to the sidelines of history. The role of the region as a provider of raw materials in conditions of exploitation and destitution  as a banana plantation and a zone of strategic and geopolitical interest determined its fate for many years. The local oligarchies had on their side the military - and had the mentality and functions more of occupiers than defenders of sovereignty - and served as the tools of ruthless exploitation from abroad. Given that the contradictions are more or less marked and that the situations of each country in the region are specific and particular to them  the basis  origins and general characteristics are one and the sane. Crude and brutal military dictatorships was for decades the dominant political system in almost all the com tries in the area. Everyone is aware of the most visible and explosive stage in our history. It is unfortunate that problems only become known about when they explode.The crisis in Central America has not been only a political and military one it was and still is an economic and social one also. For that reason  the solution should be global and should not be restricted to political bodies  which - although absolutely essential and indispensable - are not capable of dealing with the problem as a whole. This conclusion fits perfectly within the global analysis of the world situation we attempted earlier. This is why all necessary support must be given  together with the application and development of political agreements  to solve the serious economic problems and the even more serious social problems. Economic assistance for Central America must be provided immediately  without waiting for the political problem to be completely solved. Both aspects  the political and the economic  are closely and dialectically related  and must therefore must be dealt with together in the search for the necessary solution. At the political level  the progress we have made has been extremely important and provides a grounding for realistic optimism that there is a possibility that the conflict can be settled in the not-so-distant future  participation by the Latin American countries through the Contadora and Contadora Support Groups has been very important.Action by the Central American countries was decisive at the Esquipulas meetings end very particularly so at the last two summits at Costa del Sol  in El Salvador  and at Tela  in Honduras. The commitment made by the five Central American countries to have their electoral processes verified by observers from the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS)  the agreements to demobilize the counter-revolutionary forces which should be completed by December 5 this year at the latest  according to the agreed timetable - and for them to be relocated and voluntarily repatriated  end the commitment by each State not to use its territory to attack other countries undoubtedly constitute the essential points of the political accords agreed by the five Central American Presidents  and  in general terms  of the whole peace process in the region.Nicaragua  in compliance with these agreements  has invited the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the OAS to appoint commissions to verify the whole electoral process in Nicaragua  which is to be completed on 25 February 1990. Both commissions have been carrying out their work in Nicaragua for some time now. In addition  my country has invited observers from the European Parliament and also ex-Presidents Jimmy Carter of the United States and Raul Alfonsin of Argentina. We hope that the other Central American countries  in compliance with the agreements  will invite the United Nations and the OAS to observe their electoral processes.As my Government has sand  the transparency  d scope of the current electoral process in Nicaragua strengthens democracy in the country and contributes to the stability of the region. All countries must respect the sovereign nature of this process and desist from any policy of electoral interference or manipulation. The international community should immediately provide support for the effort required by this democratic exercise. In addition for the United Nations Electoral Observation Mission now functioning in Nicaragua  the United Nations is participating in the Central American peace process through the United Nations Observers in Central America  the body entrusted with verifying that irregular forces do not use cross-border operations and that the territories of Central American countries are not used to attack other nations. Then there is the International Support and Verification Commission (CIAV)  which is to demobilize the counter-revolutionaries and oversee their repatriation and resettlement.The participation of Spain  Canada  the Federal Republic of Germany and a Latin American country in the work of ONUCA will be an additional guarantee of compliance with the relevant part of the peace agreements. As stated in the declaration issued by the Nicaraguan Government on the occasion of the visit of the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  Mr. Eduard Sheverdnadze: The Esquipulas II and Tela Agreements are the framework end methodology for resolving the principal political  military and security problems facing the region. A prompt solution to the security problems among the Central American States - that is  use of territory and support for irregular groups - will pave the way for an agreement with specific deadlines  for the attainment of a reasonable balance of forces. Toward that end  the Government of Nicaragua proposes the drawing up of an agreement between the Central American Governments - setting specific deadlines - for the establishment of a reasonable balance of forces in the region.  The United Nations contingent in Central America entrusted with observing the non-use of territory and ensuring that no support is given to irregular groups should not only observe the situation but contribute in a concrete way to accelerating solutions to the specific problems regarding the use of territory and support for irregular groups. All countries should back compliance with the deadlines agreed to by the five Central American Presidents in the Tela Agreement. The International Support and Verification Commission should immediately establish machinery for administering these funds for the purposes of demobilization and repatriation  These agreements must be respected strictly since they embody the will of the five Heads of State of Central America and hold out the concrete possibility that peace may soon shine on Central American soil. In regard to other regional conflicts Nicaragua vigorously supports the principles of independence  self-determination and sovereignty.We endorse the convening and holding of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation on an equal footing  of all parties including the Palestine Liberation Organization  the sole  d legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. We support the right of the Palestinian people to establish their State on their own soil and we applaud their valiant intifadah.With respect to Namibia  we support the progress made on the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) through the participation of the United Nations in the supervision of the elections. At the same time  we fully support that resolution  whose full  implementation in its original and definitive form can ensure the cessation of existing irregularities which if allowed to continue would prevent the Namibian people from exercising self-determination and from fully exercising their sovereign rights.We back the deep aspirations to national unity of the people and Government of Cyprus  and we reaffirm our support for their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity. We uphold the thesis of direct negotiations between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front for the organization of the referendum on the Western Sahara and the structuring of the decolonization process.We are concerned that the Iran-Iraq conflict has not yet been finally resolved . We appeal to both parties to reach a rapid  total and lasting solution  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  in full compliance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987).As for Afghanistan  we uphold the right of that people to self-determination  and we consider it vitally important to strengthen the role of the Security Council in the implementation of the Geneva Agreements. We support the reunification of the Korean people. With respect to Lebanon  we express our support for the resolution adopted at the extraordinary Arab summit held in Casablanca last May  as well as for the efforts made by the Tripartite Arab Committee to fulfil the mandate it has received. We unreservedly support the peace forces in Angola and hope for the prompt resolution of the conflict. We likewise support the efforts by the international community to obtain peace for Cambodia.We also fully support the negotiations between the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (ÐÐÐ¨) and the Government of El Salvador. As the Nicaraguan Government recently stated  we recognise the importance that both the fMUi and the Salvadorian Government have attached to the necessary participation of El Salvador's parties and social forces in the current dialogue and negotiations taking place within the framework of the Tela Agreements  signed by the Central American Presidents   As the Government of Nicaragua has stated publicly  we support the right of the Panamanian people to demand compliance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties on the agreed-upon dates. Nicaragua supports the Panamanian people's right to non-interference in their internal affairs and a peaceful negotiated solution to the conflict .Although  historically speaking  law has served as an instrument for legitimating power  it is important to recognize that it has also been much more than that. It has been the mediating factor between the civil society and the political society. If laws arose in order to legitimate reigning political and economic relations  they nevertheless have since become the expression of the consensus of the social community. That is their destiny  their calling.The same thing has occurred in international law. If it is indeed true that it originated as the expression of a given set of international relations  the changes these relations have undergone must be reflected in the body of international law through its evolution and development  so that it may ever more faithfully guarantee peace and stability in the world.Now  fortunately  it would seem that the time is approaching when the positions of force that have determined international relations in the past must make way for the policies of disarmament and concerted action. International law together with direct negotiation between parties is becoming m exceptionally important tool for the attainment of peace and harmonious relations between nations.Just as in the history of national communities the organization of society and the State is based cm the rational foundation of the social pact or contract  in the history of the international community the existence of prevailing norms and traditions also presumes such a pact. However  history has taught us that law  whether national or international  arises as a result of and in response to an initial hegemonic act which generates a given structure of domination in political  economic and social relations. The social contract comes later.We believe that in the field of international law this is a moment of consensus  of tacit contract  in as much as it is a time in which all - but first and foremost the most powerful States - are searching for means of understanding  for points of equilibrium and stability  for a minimum common ground. From this perspective and in this spirit  Nicaragua  together with 14 other countries  presented to the Conference of Foreign Ministers held in Nicosia in September 1988 a draft resolution  which was approved unanimously  calling for the convening in 1989 of a special ministerial conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  with the objective of proclaiming the last decade of this century and the millennium as the Decade for Peace and International law.The Conference was held in The Hague  where the International Court of Justice is located  from 26 to 29 June of this year. In addition to proclaiming the Decade of International Law  on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  The Hague Declaration calls on the plenary Assembly of the United Nations to adopt it for the entire woe Id community.More recently  at the Belgrade summit meeting held from 4 to 7 September  the Heads of State of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries ratified the Declaration of The Hague ministerial statement and requested that at the forty-fourth session the United Nations General Assembly proclaim the next decade as the Decade of Peace end International law. In this respect  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will soon be presenting for the consideration of this session of the General Assembly a draft resolution for the proclamation oÂ£ the Decade.We hope that an era of peace and harmony among nations is approaching. We hope that the irrationality of the system of international economic relations will give way to reason and morality. There will be no peace and development however  until the problem of foreign debt is resolved globally by means of a restructuring of the system which gave rise to the debt in the first place. Bilateral solutions are partial and fictitious because they leave the underlying cause of the crisis Intact.We know that there will be no peace without development and until there is full observance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. Peace  democracy and development are three complementary  inseparable categories of social existence.Ecological destruction must be halted. This will involve a re-examination of indiscriminate and unwise industrial production policies. This planet's flora and fauna are dying) pollution is making the air unbreathable in some parts of the world  and a climatic catastrophe seems inevitable.As for the environmental problem in Central America  the interest of Nicaragua and the other countries of the region in this subject is reflected in the creation of the Central American Commission on Environment and Development  which held its first meeting only days ago.We feel it appropriate to mention here that the phenomenon of drug trafficking must not be considered exclusively from the perspective of production but mist inevitably be viewed from all angles  taking into account production  distribution  consumption and financial mechanisms.Drugs became a world-wide problem when they entered the market-place and became the object of financial speculation. Therefore  it should not be overlooked that the drug problem is part of the structural situation affecting relations between poor and highly developed countries  that we have addressed throughout this statement. For the same reason emphasis should be placed on drug consumption and distribution in the highly developed countries  as well as on its production in the poor countries. It should never be forgotten that there will be drugs for sale so long as there is a demand for them. On this subject  Nicaragua has presented for consideration by the Central American Governments a draft agreement containing proposals for machinery and action for the combating of drug trafficking in the Central American region. Similarly  in December 1988 Nicaragua signed the Vienna Treaty on this subject  and in Managua the legislative process is already under way that will lead to its ratification in the shortest possible time.After I had finished preparing this statement. In which we have omitted any reference to individual or specific responsibilities though they do exist  we unfortunately heard discordant voices from our Central American neighbours. Above all  one among them  claiming to be above good and evil  has pontificated and presented himself as a universal spokesman for democracy and a counsellor and adviser to the entire human race.Such attitudes do not foster the climate of consensus that seems to prevail today in Central America. Unfortunately those who preach urbi et orbi in this way forget that in their own country and elsewhere in the area there are serious problems of drug trafficking and human rights violations. We hope that our sister nations of the region overcome these grave situations as soon as possible so that democracy  instead of being a myth  can in fact become a reality.Political co-operation  the easing of tensions and the end of the cold war are steps of exceptional importance for the future of mankind  but they are not enough they are just first steps. Therefore it is necessary to take full advantage of the lucidity that seems to be prevailing at present in order to deal with all problems - political  social  economic and ecological - in a far-reaching way  that would address mankind as Ð° whÐ¾1Ðµ  as a system that co-ordinates and harmonizes those differences which must be seen  nevertheless  as coming from a basic interest and a common platforms the need to live with dignity end in freedom. For that to happen  solidarity and co-operation must become the basis of a new morality in relations between the peoples and among all men. Only then - and here we quote the great Nicaraguan poet  Ruben Dario - can the  sun of burning gold  shine on the future end destiny of all mankind. "
"104",5190,"NLD",44,1989,"ï»¿ I should first of all like to extend my warmest congratulations to the President on his assumption of the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. With the wisdom and experience which are his  the Assembly is evidently in good hands. He can count on the constructive co-operation of the delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.Earlier this week my colleague Mr. Roland Dumas  the Foreign Minister of France  explained the common position of the Twelve member States of the European Community on a wide range of international issues  so I need not return to all those issues addressed in his speech.A living memory of the past is essential in our efforts to shape the world of the future. This is true for each of us individually. It is also true for our collective endeavours - the United Nations itself not least among them. Knowing where we came from is a constant reminder of where we should go and where we should not.This month  50 years ago  with the Nazi attack on Poland  the Second World War broke out. What followed was not just another European war  in which force had to decide on a new balance of power. The Second World War was fought against an extremist ideology and for the ideals of freedom and democracy which in the course of the war found their expression in the Atlantic Charter. Ultimately it was a war about civilization and human values. Countless millions perished. Behind the barbed wire of occupied Europe  moreover  the most terrible form of racism the world has ever seen was unleashed. No words can describe the fate that befell European Jewry. To remember is to prevent.The end of the war saw the birth of the United Nations. The horror that was just behind them had convinced the founding fathers of our Organization that international relations had to be based on new principles and that peace could not be separated from respect for human rights and human values. But the years following that war did not bring the full realization of the ideals that had been fought for. Today  however  we witness hopeful new trends. All around the world people of different national and cultural backgrounds are reaching out for freedom and democracy. A democratic revolution of global proportions is clearly on its way.Unfortunately the legitimate aspirations of people to greater freedom and democracy are not being met in all parts of the world. Who does not recall the shocking events on Tiananmen Square this summer? Elsewhere  however  democratic forces have managed to gain the upper hand and  although often faced with difficult social and economic conditions  there can be no question that democracy is the key to tomorrow's world. Nothing holds out as much promise as a democratic society free from oppression and fear.The winds of change have not left Eastern Europe untouched. Poland has new captured the imagination of the world by its historic leap towards pluralism and democracy. Hungary seems set to take a giant step of its own in that direction. And in the Soviet Union  that breathtaking process of perestroika is opening doors that had been shut for decades  thus releasing the genius and energy of its people without which no nation can hope to thrive. We do hope that the reforms now under way will meet with success.By changing their awn societies  by making them responsive to democratic aspirations  this movement of reform can have an enormous positive impact on peace and security in Europe and indeed in the world as a whole. President Gorbachev encapsulated the essence of this  when he said to the Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg last July: ""A world where military arsenals would be reduced  but where human rights would be violated  would not be a safe place. We have made this conclusion for ourselves once and for all."" In the United Nations  too  we have been further elaborating human rights standards in certain specific areas. I want to mention in particular the Second Optional Protocol on the Abolition of the Death Penalty. The importance of this Protocol is highlighted by the recent report of Amnesty International  which shows how many death sentences are still being carried out. we would call upon this Assembly to adopt the draft Protocol at this session.But the main focus of our attention should now be on how to improve compliance with human rights. Despite improvements in many parts of the world there remains a wide gap between the standards we have set and actual practice. What is needed is a more systematic and efficient use of the monitoring mechanisms at our disposal  such as the system of Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights. Furthermore  we believe that the United Nations  through the Commission on Human Rights  should be able to respond to serious violations of human rights the moment they occur. We would also wish to warn against attempts by groups of countries  on unrelated political grounds  to prevent human rights violations from being addressed. Are not such practices extremely damaging for the credibility of the efforts of the United Nations to protect human rights?The remarkable improvement in East-West relations has given a strong impetus to arms control and disarmament. Real disarmament  such as we could only dream of at the beginning of this decade  is now beginning to materialize.Nothing illustrates the new momentum better than the contrast between the snail's pace of the former Mutually Balanced Force Reduction Talks  which never led to any agreement  and the swift advance of the current negotiations on conventional forces. Thus  for instance  we are already approaching an agreement in Vienna on common ceilings for some major categories of equipment. These are ceilings that will entail very substantial reductions. Only last week  the 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organization participants in the Vienna negotiations submitted further details of their proposals  notably concerning verification and stabilizing measuresWith regard to chemical weapons  we must not allow proliferation to catch up with the negotiations on a complete ban. We welcome the proposals President Bush made at the beginning of this session to rid the world  in his words  of""... these truly terrible weapons ..."" and work""towards a treaty that will ban - eliminate - all chemical weapons from the Earth"". (V44/PV.4  p. 56). We have every reason to make haste in Geneva. The increasing measure of agreement between the two super-Powers is in this respect very encouraging. The memorandum of understanding on a bilateral verification experiment and data exchange  just signed in Wyoming by Secretary of State Baker and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze  underlines the extent of the bilateral process  for we would expect this to help move forward also the multilateral process. In view of the urgency of the matter we favour the spreading of negotiating sessions over the year. If the world would join in  we do believe we can achieve the complete ban on chemical weapons we have sought for so long.It is in the field of nuclear arms control that progress is most tangible. All inter mediate-range nuclear missiles are now being eliminated and an agreement to halve the strategic arsenals seems to be in the offing. Last week progress was made towards agreement on improved verification arrangements needed for ratification of the threshold test-ban Treaties. And after that  we would expect the United States and the Soviet Union to seek further limits on testing in conjunction with the process of actual reductions in nuclear weapons. All this should contribute to a favourable climate for the next Review Conference of the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.While the positive trend in arms control negotiations between East and West is encouraging  one cannot overlook the fact that in some parts of the world armed conflict and its gruesome consequences are still a daily reality.The improved East-West relations and the new thinking in Soviet foreign policy have helped to remove or mitigate some of the external factors in regional conflicts. Soviet troops have left Afghanistan; Cuban troops are in the process of leaving Angola and  assuming promises have been kept  the Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia should by now just have been completed.But unfortunately  the indigenous sources of contention in these and other conflicts have proven to be less amenable to solutions. Thus the people of Cambodia  to limit myself to them  are still waiting with apprehension to discover what the future has in store for them. We can only hope that there will be no shift back to the battlefield and to massive violation of human rights  but that diplomatic efforts will continue to prevail.The more active role of the United Nations in promoting peaceful solutions in a number of regional conflicts is in itself an encouraging sign. The Security Council  benefiting from the improved international climate  has displayed greater cohesion and thus greater effectiveness. I should in particular like to pay a tribute to the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and his assistants in the many areas of tension and conflict in the world.The instrument of United Nations peace-keeping operations is proving its great value every day. Peace-keeping operations certainly are not a substitute for a political settlement  but they can be a decisive element in implementing such a settlement. We are intrigued by the gradual evolution of the role of the United Nations in promoting peace in various parts of the world. Recently we have seen how the Organization has become involved  apart from classical peace-keeping operations  in new forms of peace promotion. The clearest example can be found in the Esquipulas process in Central America  where the United Nations will not only monitor compliance with the agreements but also observe  together with others  the election process  an absolute first  in one of the Member States of the Organization.No doubt the current transition towards the independence of Namibia under United Nations supervision is indeed one of the most challenging and significant operations ever undertaken by the world Organization  as the Secretary-General observes in his report to the Assembly. We would like to commend both the civilian and the military personnel of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) for the way they are dealing with this difficult task. My country is proud to be contributing a contingent of military police to this operation  thus playing our part in ensuring a scrupulous implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia.Fundamental change in South Africa itself is long overdue. Who can contest that the system of apartheid contravenes basic human values and that it must be dismantled? Further procrastination or half-way measures will only make the inevitable process of change more difficult and painful.Now that the all-White elections are behind us - and let us hope these are the last of their kind - we are waiting to see what the new government will undertake. Pronouncements by the new South African President about ""writing a new chapter in the history of South Africa"" are raising expectations. But words like these have not been spoken for the first time. They will have to be followed by deeds if they are to remain credible.It is essential that a process of dialogue and negotiation between all parties be started before long within South Africa. But it is clear that decades of oppression have bred deep distrust about the preparedness of the South African Government to bring about real change. Indeed  how can there be talks if leading figures of the opposition  like Nelson Mandela  are still in gaol and their organizations remain banned? In his inaugural address earlier this month. President De Klerk Galled on the international community to take note of what is happening in South Africa and to adopt a positive attitude towards developments in that country. We are receptive to positive appeals  but  clearly  it is now up to the South African Government to take concrete steps that will create confidence and initiate dialogue. I repeat that it will have to do so before long  with the politically deprived in South Africa  we are eager to see a fundamental change of direction. If such a change does not come there will be no alternative for the international community but to reconsider its position vis-Ã -vis South Africa.I wish to make a few remarks regarding the Middle East in addition to what my French colleague said earlier this week on behalf of the Twelve.The difficult quest for a peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict received new impetus with the declared acceptance by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) of Israel's right to exist and its renunciation of terrorism. These are welcome developments. It is  of course  essential that those principles should find consistent application in PLO policy. It is equally important that Israel  for its part  carefully reconsider its priorities and contribute towards a comprehensive settlement on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1978) and 338 (1973)  including the principle of the exchange of land for peace. Such a settlement should accommodate both Israel's right to secure and recognized borders and the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.Negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians  and the peaceful solution that should result from them  will necessarily be a step-by-step process  each stage contributing to greater confidence and understanding. The proposal by Israel for elections in the occupied territories deserves serious consideration  provided it is the beginning and not the end of a process leading to a comprehensive settlement. In this connection  we welcome the efforts currently being made by President Mubarak of Egypt to bring about the urgently needed negotiations between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian people.With regard to the situation in the Korean peninsula  I should like to express again here the hope that before long the Republic of Korea will be represented in our world Organization. The recent proposal by the Republic of Korea for a national community charter may contribute to improving relations within the peninsula.I should now like to make a few remarks about the international economic situation  because the struggle against poverty  malnutrition and underdevelopment is far from being won. Imbalances in the world economy persist. The unequal international distribution of wealth  the discrepancy between population growth and economic development and the persisting external debt problems in many developing countries all point to the need for new and imaginative approaches.The forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on the reactivation of economic growth should provide a set of realistic guidelines and principles for future international economic co-operation. Building on the outcome of the special session  the international development strategy for the forthcoming development decade should shape a framework for sustainable economic and social development. This requires favourable internal as well as external conditions) here there is a shared responsibility of both developing and developed countries. The new strategy must take into account the different needs and situations in individual countries and regions and the varying degrees of development in the world. The situation in the least developed countries  particularly in Africa  remains alarming and therefore deserves our attention.Many years ago the Netherlands  together with some other countries  set an example by reaching a disbursement level of 1 per cent of its gross domestic product for development purposes. In recent years a few other countries have substantially increased their level of official development assistance  but many others  it must be admitted  are still lagging behind. The international community - certainly those countries benefiting the most from the economic upswing we have experienced in recent years - should do its utmost to attain the adopted target for official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product.The United Nations as an organization is being called upon to undertake new challenging tasks at a time when it is carrying out a process of profound reform. We have the feeling that the reform process is now on the right track. New budgetary procedures are in place and the Secretariat is being streamlined. On the other hand  the restructuring of the intergovernmental machinery of the Organization - in particular  in the economic and social sectors - is far from being completed. In the Netherlands' view all of these reforms should be pursued with vigour. This can only further strengthen Member States' already renewed confidence in the United Nations and enable the Organization to respond more effectively to the many challenges that lie ahead.The members of the United Nations should for their part  of course  pay outstanding contributions - in fact  share the burden of the many essential activities of the Organization  including peace-keeping. This is also true of actions required to meet manifold new urgent humanitarian needs and emergency situations that continue to demand our attention. Indeed  Hurricane Hugo  which left a trail of destruction in the Caribbean region and elsewhere  demonstrates  once again  that the United Nation system should also be able to play a role in the case of natural - ""nature-made"" - disasters.Let me make a few remarks about man-made disasters. One of the most formidable challenges of our time is the degradation of our environment. The grating list of threats is by now well-known: warming of the atmosphere  depletion of the ozone layer  the ever-increasing volume of waste  the expanding deserts and reckless deforestation - to mention just a few of the many man-made disasters. Clearly  we have a collective duty to change our attitudes and habits.The Brundtland Report deserves credit for alerting the world to the magnitude of the challenge. The increasing international awareness of the interdependence between environment and development is important  but awareness is of course only the first step; solutions have to follow. Bach Government has a responsibility to protect the environment  as stipulated by the Stockholm Principles of 1972.The threat to our atmosphere and its gradual warming undoubtedly constitute one of the most pressing problems  in March this year 24 Heads of State or Government from many parts of the world gathered in The Hague  the Netherlands  to discuss these issues. The Declaration they signed  which has since been endorsed by many more countries  calls for urgent action and sets out innovative approaches to tackle the problem of climatic change.We are indeed convinced that we should aim for a world climate convention and we hope this can be achieved within the next two years. The second United Nations climate conference will be an important step in the process towards such a convention  and the Netherlands greatly values the preparatory work and the technical studies currently being carried out in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).Our endeavours to protect the atmosphere  and indeed the environment as a whole  can be successful only with the full participation of the developing countries as well. At the same time  I am well aware of the many pressing and often conflicting needs which confront most of these countries. While this cannot of course detract from the shared responsibility for the preservation of our planet  I believe that the industrialized countries have an obligation to help these already overburdened nations. Thus  we shall have to devise mechanisms for technical and financial assistance  so as to enable the developing countries to carry out the measures a climate convention would require of them. Such measures are likely to include matters such as forest management  industrial adaptation  energy  pollution monitoring and research  and I can state that my country is prepared to contribute to such a financial mechanism. With the aim of providing an additional impulse to the efforts to solve the problems of atmospheric pollution and climate change  the Netherlands Government is organizing a ministerial conference on these issues to be held in the Netherlands next November  and we are gratified that many countries will attend.More generally  I believe we should reflect on ways of strengthening the international instruments for the protection of the environment. In an age of ecological interdependence  the nations of this world can no longer afford to go their separate ways. We need further international law-making - a climate convention would be an example here - but we also need world-wide monitoring of pollution levels and more effective control over compliance with environmental standards and obligations. The United Nations  with its universal membership  is the obvious framework in which to bring about such a global response.A first step would be to strengthen UNEP. In this connection  I am happy to announce that my Government has decided to double its contribution to UNEP in the period 1990 to 1994. Quite a few other ideas and proposals for enhancing the authority and role of the United Nations in the protection of the environment have beer put forward recently. I mention the Declaration of The Hague  but there are also other proposals  including those which the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have already made. These ideas deserve to be further explored  perhaps also on a subject-by-subject basis. The Netherlands stands ready to take an active part in such an exercise. All the threads of the current debates will come together at the conference on environment and development in 1992. The Governing Council of UNEP has forwarded a set of well-balanced recommendations concerning the preparations for this conference which  in my view  deserve to be endorsed by the General Assembly. The 1992 conference would  to my mind  be the ideal opportunity to set the seal on a world-wide agreement on measures to strengthen the authority of the United Nations with regard to the protection of our environment.Earlier I said mankind has to learn from its past in order to face the future. This is a perpetual learning process  but in the way we deal with our environment we are approaching dangerous thresholds that cannot be crossed with impunity. The damage already done is staggering  though still not beyond repair. Nevertheless  it is the very conditions for life on Earth that are at stake.As the Secretary-General puts it in his report to the Assembly  political conditions have made it possible to return to the way of handling international affairs envisaged in the Charter. For this trend to continue  however  the international community must muster the will to make a sustained effort. It is particularly imperative for regional problems to be solved  other pressing international problems must also be addressed with vigour. I mentioned the imminent dangers for the global environment. I could add others  such as the drug problem  which are threatening to undermine the very fabric of our societies; I could add international terrorism  which menaces the international community  its Member States and its citizens alike. A renewed effort by the Organization is urgently called for. I am fully confident that in unison the community of nations can bring a solution to these problems  "
"105",5235,"NOR",44,1989,"ï»¿It is a great pleasure  Mr. President  to congratulate you upon your election as President of this session of the General Assembly. I feel confident that you will guide our work to a successful conclusion.The challenges that we face together are enormous. On the threshold of the last decade of this century  we shall have to wake choices and take decisions that will determine the course of human progress far into the next millennium. The unparalleled speed and scope of the changes now facing us are the most striking characteristic of our time. We are witnessing rapid globalisation.Changes involve uncertainty. But change also involves opportunity. We must seize this opportunity. We must agree and act on a global agenda for the management of change. If we fail to act  or if we act wrongly  we may soon face a threat to our future.We are living in a transitional period. The awareness of the conflicts between human activities and environmental constraints is literally exploding. Even today  the number of poor  illiterate or unemployed people in the world is growing. This finite world of ours will have to provide food and energy for a troubled world population sometime in the next century. It may have to sustain a world economy which is five or ten times larger than the present one. This cannot be done by perpetuating present patterns.We have made some progress in our efforts to prevent war. But while nuclear war remains a long-term threat to our survival  the process of ecological degradation constitutes a clear and present danger. We are experiencing it in our daily life. It is increasingly visible everywhere. People all over the world are not just worried about their own and their children's future: they are deeply anxious about the future of this planet.As we approach the third millennium  we must fashion a global concept of security that will embrace the notion of sustainable development  the need to combat underdevelopment  the unequal distribution of wealth  the degradation of our environment and the depletion of our resources. We are facing a new era which will have to be shaped by responses to common challenges which unite mankind  rather than the conflicts which have divided nations in the past. Nations can no longer attain security through competition and at each other's expense. They have to seek co-operation in order to enhance their common security.We are witnessing amazing changes in East-West relations. Old tensions are abating. As stated by the United States Secretary of State  James Baker  only two days ago  the United States and the Soviet Union have moved from confrontation through dialogue to co-operation  and we all heard this in the statement by President Bush in the Assembly this morning.We welcome the commitment of the United States and the Soviet Union to cut their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons by half. We are heartened by the progress made during the recent meeting in Wyoming. Success would serve as a recognition of the fact that nuclear weapons are not the solution to genuine security: their competitive accumulation leads to the insecurity of nations. This message is of fundamental importance to our efforts to stem the further spread of nuclear weapons.We should urge the nuclear weapon States to further strengthen that message by concluding a comprehensive test-ban treaty. In the meantime  we welcome the progress made towards ratification of the threshold test-ban treaty and the treaty on peaceful nuclear explosions. A ban on chemical weapons is an urgent requirement. I therefore warmly welcome the new initiative presented by the United States President this mornings it is my sincere hope that this new step  and the understanding reached between the Soviet Union and the United States  will pave the way for a total ban on chemical weapons.For the first time  the nations of East and West in Europe have sat down to deal with the dangers of their military confrontation  which have divided that continent for more than four decades. Again  it is the recognition of common interests which provides the engine. We now see the opportunity to reduce instabilities and to prevent military dispositions from blocking a promising process of peaceful change. Our task should be the construction of an open  equitable and co-operative political order where nations enjoy equal security at the lowest possible level of military force. We are intent on contributing actively to this all-important process of transformation  which is now fostering co-operation among all the nations which make up the security order in Europe.By lowering and moving the military walls in Europe we are opening ourselves to a new era of co-operation. We must seek expanded economic relations on the basis of commercially sound principles and open economies. We must seek practical co-operation and common approaches to environmental protection. We must expand scientific and technological co-operation and broaden our cultural exchanges.Countries in eastern and central Europe have embarked on a new course. They are engaging in a process of reform and democratisation in their internal policies as well as in their approach to the common challenges which confront us. We welcome - and we support - these efforts. We cannot guarantee their success. They must forge their own future. They must shape their own societies. Nevertheless  we shall convey in tangible and substantive ways our will for co-operation and indeed our solidarity with the peoples of eastern Europe  who have embarked on a new quest for freedom.Political change reflects and creates new social energies and aspirations. The quest for human freedom defies oppression. Our commitment to the protection of the universal human rights recognizes no boundaries of State. It is a transnational commitment which transcends borders in Europe and in the world at large.I welcome the declaration from the ninth non-aligned Summit in Belgrade  with its emphasis on human rights and the rights of women and their role in development. The declaration bears witness to the broadening support for these ideals. I strongly endorse what the Secretary-General observes in his report: ""...it is becoming increasingly plain that no Government can expect immunity from international exposure to criticism if it flouts human rights in trying to overcome political dissidence or ethnic unrest."" (A/44/1  sect. VII) This year's General Assembly will consider the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Norway has taken an active part in the process  and we urge the Assembly to adopt the Convention. We have seen significant progress in the resolution of regional conflicts over the past year. My Government will present its view on these conflicts later during this General Assembly. One of the most hopeful changes has been the renewed trust in the United Nations  in viewing United Nations peace-keeping as an alternative to intervention.Norway fully supports the Secretary-General's observations about the serious consequences of the financial shortfall affecting United Nations peace-keeping operations. Let me also stress the need for stronger political support for present operations. A special responsibility lies with the Security Council  which  in some cases  inter alia  in southern Lebanon  has failed to bring the weight of its authority to hear on those parties which defy the will of the international community and prevent the peace-keepers from fulfilling their mandate.In Namibia  the foundation is being laid for a new independent State in Africa. Although the difficulties are manifold  we trust that the parties involved  with the assistance of the United Nations  will bring independence  and that process  forward on schedule. Norway  for its part  is ready to contribute its share to this historic development on the African continent.The international community must rally to the task of combating the many challenges to our common security: the proliferation of nuclear and chemical arms  as well as their means of delivery; poverty; terrorism; and drug trafficking.Let me call your particular attention to the serious international problem of drug abuse. There are no simple solutions: we need a broad strategy encompassing the control of supplies  the reduction of demand  the suppression of trafficking  and the prevention and treatment of addiction. Resources are needed at all levels: to assist producer countries in reducing the export of illicit drugs to the largest markets  to control the demand for drugs in the major ""consumer"" countries  and to establish effective international co-operation  in the field of law enforcement also. Illicit drug trafficking is indeed an international problem. It solution requires global co-operation. We need to strengthen the United Nations by committing funds and vesting decision-making authority in United Nations institutions.Since the publication of the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development two and a half years ago  we have witnessed a surge in awareness concerning the environment. Several factors have contributed to this change. Reports of severe and lasting ecological degradation because of atmospheric  water or soil pollution are coming in from many regions of the world. Our scientists warn us that we may be facing a general global warming and significant changes in world climate.The stratospheric ozone shield may be in danger. Scientific and technological developments are continuously opening new possibilities for modifying nature  for example through advances in biotechnology. At the same time  we are in the process of losing global biological and genetic diversity at an unprecedented rate  particularly through the rapid reduction of tropical rain forests.If we look at the agenda of international conferences and negotiations on environmental questions for the next three years we find an impressive level of activities. At this session we have before us the consolidated report of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. We are pleased to note that most of the United Nations organizations and many Governments are in the process of giving effect to the recommendations of the report. It is encouraging that the recent Western economic summit meeting  as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  the World Bank and others  called for the integration of environmental concerns in day-to-day economic decision-making. Similarly  the non-aligned countries have called for urgent co-operative measures to ensure a sustainable and environmentally sound development.A key principle in that process has been sustainability  a clear recognition and admission that economic development has  so far  not been sustainable. We need a green agenda. We need growth that respects the limitations set by nature. However  growth itself should not be limited. Poverty alleviation does not compete with sustainable development. Environmentally sound investments are necessary to sustain development. The industrialized countries carry a particular responsibility for securing growth in the world economy and opening markers to exports from developing countries. Developing countries have declared their readiness to undertake necessary policy reforms. I believe they should pursue and strengthen those efforts. However  to succeed we need the support of the international community.Devastating debt burdens have for too long hampered growth and development in third world countries. It is now vital that the debt burdens be reduced to sustainable levels. We therefore fully support the view that debt reductions must occupy centre stage. The international community now recognizes the need to reduce the debt overhang. However  our strategy will succeed only if it is fully implemented. The readiness of commercial banks to play their part remains vital. We are concerned about reports that the banks are now failing to make new capital available for developing countries and thus to live up to their responsibilities under the Brady Plan.We must agree on measures to restore development in the debt-ridden countries. Financial transfers to developing countries must be increased. The growth in aid volume has stagnated deplorably. The United Nations target of a 0.7 per cent ratio between official development assistance and gross national product is far from being met. Many countries both could and should do much better. I see no reason to conceal the fact that  while Norway has given around 1 per cent of its QJP in official development assistance to developing countries  we are disappointed that the OECD average has declined to a meagre 0.34 per cent.But aid alone will not suffice. The importance of increased export earnings for the economies of developing countries cannot be overemphasized. Protectionist tendencies must be halted and reversed.The question of energy is also in fact intimately linked both with economic growth and with environmental protection. We have lacked an energy dialogue in the past. We have felt the shock waves that sharply fluctuating oil prices have sent through the world economy. Norway sees the need to start a new dialogue on energy issues that will also address related environmental concerns.Regional action is a central part of the processes of follow-up to the World Commission. African Ministers of Economic Planning  Education and Environment met at Kampala in June to set priorities for action to implement the recommendations of the report. In the Kampala Declaration they frankly state that economic development that is not sustainable should no longer be called development. We look forward to similar action from the conferences scheduled for Asia and the Pacific and for Latin America in 1990.The industrialized countries account for the bulk of the world's accumulated pollution and resource depletion. Next May the countries of Europe and North America will meet at Bergen  Norway  for the regional follow-up meeting for ""Our Common Future"" in the region of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE). We expect that conference to adopt a strong ministerial declaration that will reflect the commitment and political readiness of ECE Governments to set new national and regional targets for concrete action.Next year the Second World Climate Conference will convene at Geneva. The spectre of global climate change is increasingly emerging as the most alarming environmental problem facing us. The abnormal variations in weather patterns we have witnessed during the 1980s and the human suffering and the enormous damage caused by floods  drought or hurricane in the course of the past few years have only underlined the need for action.The Hague Declaration in March of this year called for new and wide-ranging principles for international co-operation to protect the atmosphere. Some 40 countries have now signed the Hague Declaration  and many others have indicated their support. The Declaration defines the need for new institutional authority  either by strengthening existing organizations or by creating a new institution  but within the framework of the United Nations. It calls for specific emission standards and targets  as well as for dispute settlement procedures binding on the parties. The establishment of new mechanisms to secure genuinely additional financial resources is a matter of priority. Such financial compensation would enable poor countries to adjust their economies more successfully to a sustainable development pattern. The Norwegian Government has proposed the establishment of an international climate fund with individual industrialized â country contributions in the order of 0.1 per cent of GNP.The work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  under the leadership of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)  is of crucial importance in the elaboration of strategies for combating global warming. The Panel's report  which is due by September of next year  will form the main basis for the preparation of a global convention on climate. I urge full support of the work under way in the IPCC. We are encouraged that an increasing number of developing countries are now taking part in that process. There is no competition or conflict between the Hague initiative and the IPCC process. On the contrary  the Hague Declaration is intended to strengthen and supplement processes already under way internationally to protect the world climate.The follow-up process of the report and the intensive research and negotiations now in progress concerning climate both point forward to the 1992 conference on environment and development. The forty-fourth session of the General Assembly will take important decisions on the preparatory process leading to the 1992 conference. We have noted the support of the Belgrade non-aligned summit for the candidacy of Brazil to host the conference. We feel confident that this would be a good choice  and we support it. It underlines the message that the conference should be addressing the vital linkage between environment and development.Let me briefly outline my views on what we should aim for during our preparations for 1992.First  the 1992 conference should he based on the concept of sustainable development. There is no way that we can solve the global environment problems now facing us without a direct linkage to a broader economic and social development process.Secondly  and for those reasons  the preparatory process should address the need for additional financial resources. Cleaning up accumulated pollution and reversing present processes of ecological degradation are clearly going to be expensive. The alternative of doing nothing or too little  however  will be even more expensive. The developing countries will need increased assistance to help them avoid making the same mistakes that the industrialized world has made over and over again. I welcome the proposal made by Prime Minister Gandhi at the last non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade for the establishment of a planet protection fund. Several other financial mechanisms could also be explored  such as a system of consumer tax on non-renewable resources and users' fees on harmful emissions. We must he willing both nationally and internationally to apply such rules and principles.Thirdly  we should set a timeframe for the negotiations on a global climate convention which would enable us to sign it during the 1992 conference  if at all possible.Fourthly  we should make a new and committed effort to strengthen our institutions. Here  again  I attach particular importance to the creation of effective instruments which can deal with the challenges to the world climate. Perhaps that could be done through a strong monitoring mechanism for the forthcoming climate convention.The 1980s have been characterized as a lost decade for development. This is true  even if there are notable exceptions. At the same time  we have experienced a crisis of multilateralism as nations have turned away from international institutions when concerted action has been most needed. The global vision has given way to fragmented outlooks and unilateral impulses.But we have also seen economic globalisation on an unprecedented scale. The revolution in information  biotechnology and other technologies  the liberalization of capital markets  and the ensuing integration of trade and financial movements constitute but a few examples. Governments run the danger of losing control. National Governments are increasingly unable to cope with a situation of global interdependence  and our international institutions are still not given sufficient authority or resources to meet the new generation of problems. We face the reality of a global economy that is unbalanced  fragmented and interdependent at the same time.We support the idea of convening a North-South summit under the aegis of the United Nations  with the aim of moving towards a more equitable and effective system of co-ordination and co-operation between industrialized and developing countries in linking economic and environmental tasks of global importance.The time has come for a recommitment to multilateralism  to the search for global solutions. And we need to adopt new approaches. I believe we face an era in which the new threats to our security must be given the same high-level attention as the traditional issues concerning war and peace. Our founding fathers saw the need for a strong institution to deal with threats to international peace and security. I believe that certain elements of supranationality should now be considered at the global level. The challenges from the environment are a case in point. In regional co-operation  nations are gradually learning to accept majority decisions that on occasion may be viewed as contrary to narrowly defined national interests. The long-term view must come to prevail also in our global co-operation.The international community is rediscovering the United Nations  how indispensable it is and how useful it can be  provided nations furnish it with the means to function as required. A global agenda for the management of change requires a strong United Nations. Collective management of global interdependence is no empty slogan. It is  very simply  the only acceptable formula for enlightened statecraft as we move into the last decade of this millennium."
"106",5281,"NPL",44,1989,"ï»¿I have the honour to convey to you  Sir and through you to the representatives assembled here  greetings from my august Sovereign  His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev  and his best wishes for the success of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.I consider it a great privilege to offer to you  on behalf of the delegation of Nepal and on my own behalf  our sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The complex issues on our agenda demand the qualities of leadership  diplomatic skill  and experience that you so admirably command. Your unanimous election also attests to the important role that your great com try  Nigeria  continues to play in promoting international understanding  co-operation and peace. My delegation looks forward to working under your guidance for the success of this session.May I also convey our deep appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of the Argentine Republic  for the able and exemplary manner in which he guided the work of the last session of the General Assembly.  He more than justified the confidence reposed in him by the international community.Although the fortunes of the United Nations have not quite turned around  we have come a long way since the challenges of solvency and viability caused a serious crisis only a few years ago. The renewed trust in the Organization as an irreplaceable instrument for regulating international relations and resolving international problems is a remarkable achievement and a lasting tribute to the patient diplomacy of the Secretary-General  Mt. Javier Perez de Cuellar. He deserves our gratitude and support.The present session of the General Assembly meets amidst far-reaching changes taking place on the international scene. Most encouraging is the visible thaw in the situation of cold war. The Secretary-General rightly emphasized in one of his earlier reports that the requisite relationship between the roost powerful States was indispensable to the creation of conditions in which the noble concepts of the Charter could be made to function for the benefit of all. A beginning towards that requisite relationship has apparently been made. With the lowering of East-West tensions  support for the United Nations is coming from powerful sources that have the capacity to make the Organization an effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security.Indeed  the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan  the cease-fire in the Gulf war  the implementation of the plan for the independence of Namibia  and recent developments in Kampuchea and Central America are just a few concrete examples of what the Organization is capable of achieving given the full co-operation of its Members. However  as the prospects for irreversible progress on those a\d other fronts ace at best tenuous  constant vigilance and watchful tending of the Organization are called for.As the international community prepares for the advent of the twenty-first century  it is heartening to note that the divisive schisms of the past ate being bridged and that many familiar prejudices of yesteryear have crumbled. There is no guarantee  unfortunately  that the dynamics of the international situation  which encourage a return to conducting international affairs in keeping with the principles of the Chatter  ace irreversible. In fact  as we perceive it  the very fluidity of the present world situation could indeed spur a new generation of threats to international peace and security. As super-Power rivalries are being toned down and areas of super-Power confrontation rapidly shrink  we believe there lurks the danger of adventurist forces seeking to fill or exploit the vacuum thus created. It is also our perception that the uncertainties created by the fast-approaching demise of the cold war have greatly enhanced the importance of upholding the fundamental principle of non-intervention.In that context I wish to recall the sober assessment of the plight of weak and small States presented by His Majesty King Birendra at the recently concluded ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade. His Majesty stated:""In fact  the small and the weaker nations among us even in our times staid still exposed not merely to under-development but also to threats regarding security and stability. They are susceptible to many forces beyond their control  be it the onslaught of mass communication or the threat of gun-boat diplomacy. While the strong ones can pursue the goals of economic  technological aid military prowess  the weaker and vulnerable countries have to struggle constantly for bare survival. That is why we feel their voices should be heard  their identities maintained and their survival assured"".  I may recall here that Nepal has always rejected the primeval concept of ""spheres of influence"". It also resolutely rejects that obsolete doctrine's pernicious corollary that the security of the bigger and stronger States is more important than that of the weaker ones. To accept such a concept would be not only to make a mockery of the Charter principles of the Organization  but also to invite the Armageddon that the world body has sought to prevent  successfully so far. Nepal will therefore support any concerted move by the United Nations to consider seriously practical ways in WHICH the existing mechanisms of the Organization could be used more effectively in meeting the demands created by the exigencies of a thawing but unpredictable international situation. We welcome the initiative of the Maldives to add to the agenda of the General Assembly an item entitled ""Protection and security of small States"". We have studied with great interest its proposal for strengthening the security of small States by  inter alia  devising a mechanism within the United Nations that would be able to respond quickly in the event the security of a small State is threatened.In this context  I wish to recall the proposal of His Majesty King Birendra that Nepal be declared a zone of peace. I am pleased to announce that this proposal has secured the valuable endorsement of 110 States Members of the Organization  for which I reiterate our deep appreciation. We have long held that Nepal's zone of peace proposal - which is a natural corollary of our policy of scrupulous adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter aid non-alignment - could be a useful addition to the existing corpus of confidence-building measures. We believe that Nepal's proposal will be recognized by the international community as a practical example of how small States may safeguard their security while being permitted to mobilize their total energies aid limited resources for the awesome challenges of development.The need for the United Nations is demonstrated most palpably when it comes to dealing with problems that transcend national boundaries. The environment  and the growing evidence of global climate change  is one such problem that invites out urgent notice. Nepal has always been an active supporter of initiatives connected with the conservation of man's natural environment aid looks forward to high-level participation at the proposed United Nations Conference on Development and the Environment slated for 1992. I should like to take this opportunity to invite the attention of the international community to the special environmental concerns of my land-locked and largely mountainous country. The Nepalese delegation has stressed in the General Assembly year after year  there is an urgent need to address the serious problem of environmental degradation of the Himalayan foothills beginning with an forestation campaign on an appropriate scale to complement our own determined but necessarily limited endeavours. Such a project  we believe  would not only help check the quite unplanned export of an estimated 250 cubic meters of precious topsoil from Nepal to the Bay of Bengal every year but also greatly assist in preventing the tragic annual visitation of deluge  devastation and despair in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains of India and Bangladesh  downstream from Nepal  I should add that such an internationally assisted programme to provide verdant cover to the now largely denuded lower slopes of the Himalayas would also have a most beneficial effect in preserving the traditional climatic pattern of bountiful monsoon rains for three to four months every year that sustains the life of hundreds of millions in our region.As the first tell-tale signs of climate change and desertification are already beginning to manifest themselves in the Himalayan foothills  along with increasing denudation of forest cover  we believe only a well-planned and adequately funded effort at forestation can prevent drastic changes in climate including in the pattern and quantity of rainfall  that looms so ominously on the horizon.It is against this worrisome backdrop that I must inform the Assembly that since 23 March this year we have been compelled to put our diminishing forests to the axe. Bereft of fossil fuels of our own and dependent on others for the import of gasoline and petroleum products for meeting our energy needs  Nepal has no other recourse. We have been losing what remains of our once plentiful forests at the alarming rate of 240 hectares per day to meet the demand for firewood. Another  more costly option  for putting an end to the process of felling trees for the energy needs of Nepal's rising population is to exploit our abundant water resources for power generation purposes. If adequate in technical assistance were forthcoming  not only would Nepal's demand for such firewood supply be eliminated and imports of petroleum products drastically reduced  but non-polluting energy resources would also be made available for export purposes. I should like to recall the proposal by His Majesty King Birendra in 1977 indicating Nepal's readiness to co-operate with countries in our region for joint ventures to exploit our hydro-resources for the collective welfare of our peoples.The twin dangers of man-induced climate change and serious environmental degradation of the foothills of the Nepalese Himalayas are inextricably linked  in our case  to Nepal's land-locked geographical condition. While this physical handicap afflicts a score of developing countries  it is not surprising to us that most least developed countries are land-locked. The lack of sovereign access to the sea and its implications  exacerbated by the very remoteness from overseas markets and by the generally poor transit facilities  give rise to crippling freight costs  additional transportation times and additional transport risks. In sum  they can seriously affect their very survival  especially if actions taken by transit countries result in the denial or delay of unrestricted transit of goods and services to such countries. It is for this reason that Nepal has always championed the cause of land-locked developing countries in this and other international forums. In particular  Nepal has always advocated the unqualified recognition by the international community of the inherent right of land-locked countries to free access to and from the sea and freedom of transit  as has been recognized by various international instruments  including the United Nations law of the Sea Convention. We shall continue to do so in the future  too  working not only for unfettered transit rights for land-locked countries but also for accords that would make this unfortunate category of sovereign Member States equal beneficiaries of the bounties of the seas  as was eloquently urged here the other day by His Excellency General Andres Rodriguez  President of the Republic of Paraguay-The twentieth century will be remembered for the colossal loss of human life in conflicts as much as for the material and technological progress achieved. With the available technological and scientific knowledge  the spectre of hunger  poverty and backwardness can be eliminated for all mankind. Yet  as this century of war and technological marvels draws to a close  it is indeed a bitter paradox that for millions of people destitution is the way of life.Since its inception  the United Nations has recognized the inseparable link between political and economic independence. The development imperatives of the developing countries have become the central issue of our times. Wider acceptance of the global economic interdependence notwithstanding  the strategy for the establishment of a just economic order remains only an expression of pious intention. The debt problem is but one manifestation of a crisis which has deeper political implications. We hope that the special session of the General Assembly next year will prove to be an occasion for a sober assessment of the prevailing situation  thereby providing a basis for the launching of a serious North-South dialogue.The vagaries of the world economy have  predictably  hit the least developed countries the hardest. The targets set out in the Substantial New Programme of Action for the 1980s for the least Developed Countries have largely remained unfulfilled. Experience gained as a result of the Programme have shown that support measures for these countries cannot be predicated on programmes with short-term bases.	In addition  the structural adjustment programmes should be compatible with the medium- and long-term development needs of the least developed countries. The second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held next year  offers an opportunity to review the entire situation  and my delegation looks forward to the full co-operation of the international community  which will help in placing those countries on the path of sustained growth and development.I wish now to turn to some of the important political issues before us.The implementation of the plan for the independence of Namibia is one of the roost significant and fulfilling operations ever mounted by the United Nations. We commend the determination of the Secretary-General to stand firm and carry out faithfully the mandate entrusted to him. We are especially heartened by his determination to ensure that the voter registration process  the draft electoral laws and the laws relating to the power of the Constituent Assembly are to the satisfaction of the United Nations  so as to enable the Namibian people to participate in free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations  without intimidation  threat or interference.Nepal is equally committed to the eradication of the universally-condemned system of apartheid in South Africa. We salute the brave freedom fighters of South Africa who have refused to compromise in their struggle for equality and justice and for the establishment of a multiracial democratic society in South Africa. We renew our appeal for the imposition of mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter further to isolate South Africa  and call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political detainees  including Nelson Mandela  and the lifting of all restrictions on the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress.My delegation earnestly hopes that the parties concerned will continue to co-operate with the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity to bring to a satisfactory end the 14-year-old dispute in Western Sahara.We are encouraged by the Secretary-General's optimism concerning the prospect for the solution of the Cyprus question. My delegation reiterates its support for the good offices of the Secretary-General in finding a solution that ensures the territorial integrity  independence and non-aligned character of Cyprus.In the Middle East  the continuing uprising of the Palestinian people in territories occupied by Israel since 1967  despite heavy-handed efforts to suppress it  has underlined the need to intensify efforts for a negotiated settlement that would meet the uncompromising valid needs of the two peoples: national self-determination for the Palestinian people and security foe Israel  lb this end  my delegation reiterates its support for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations.We are deeply concerned at the recent deterioration of the situation in Lebanon  where a fragile cease-fire is now in place. As a participant in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  Nepal is committed to upholding the unity  sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of Lebanon. We also support the continuing efforts of the Arab League to bring to an end the tragic fratricide in Lebanon.The cease-fire in the war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq has brought to an end the heavy toll in human life aid material damage. The region  however  remains tense due to lack of progress in negotiations. I wish to reiterate my delegation's full support for the untiring efforts of the Secretary-General to secure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  which remains the only universally accepted basis to secure a just and lasting peace in the region. We have welcomed the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in conformity with the Geneva Agreements. Those Agreements constitute an important steps however  agreement among the Afghans themselves is crucial for the settlement of the problem. Faithful adherence to the Geneva Agreements by all parties concerned  together with the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 43/20  will facilitate such dialogue and create conditions for the Afghan people to exercise their right to self-determination and to enable the refugees to return to their homeland in safety  honour and peace.The Jakarta Informal Meetings have initiated some positive developments with regard to the situation in Kampuchea. While welcoming the decision of Viet Nam to withdraw its forces from Kampuchea  we wish to emphasize the need for international supervision of such withdrawal as well as for agreement on the establishment of an interim quadripartite authority and on the question of Vietnamese settlers.We continue to support the aspirations of the Korean people for national unity and reconciliation through direct and peaceful negotiations between the two sides without outside interference. As progress towards that laudable goal continues  regrettably  to be elusive  and in keeping with the principle of the universality of the United Nations  my delegation can support any move for the admission of the two Koreas to the world body  either after reunification  as one State  or  till then  by any State that desires such membership.We support the agreement reached by the Central American countries recently for the implementation of the goals set out in the Esquipulas II Agreement and the move for the establishment of the international support and verification commission in that regard.Improved bilateral relations between the United States and the Soviet Union  epitomized by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  the INF Treaty  have undoubtedly raised hopes for meaningful progress in  the field of disarmament. Nepal believes that it is crucial to capitalize on what has been achieved to push resolutely foe deep cuts in the strategic arsenals of the two super-Powers. A firm reversal of the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons will have the most salutary impact on efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Together with deep cuts in strategic nuclear arms  the goal of a comprehensive ban on all nuclear-weapon tests needs to be followed resolutely. We have accordingly supported the move to convene a meeting of the parties to the partial test ban Treaty with a view to amending it to cover all nuclear-weapon tests. Efforts for an early conclusion of a comprehensive treaty banning chemical weapons has received fresh impetus from the Paris Conference on chemical weapons  held in January this year. The increasing sophistication of conventional weapons and the growing international transfer of these weapons have added urgency to the need to address the issue of conventional disarmament. We welcome the move towards a major reduction of conventional weapons and forces in Europe  and urge that the goal of conventional disarmament be pursued resolutely at regional and sub regional levels in other parts of the world.As the Secretary-General has noted in his annual report  the spread of knew-hew  not only in the field of nuclear weapons but also in chemical and missile technology  has introduced a new and potentially destabilizing factor. Unless the international community remains vigilant  such developments may well negate any possible gain made through big-Power disarmament agreements.It is ironic that  while the political climate in the United Nations continues to improve steadily  the Organization continues to live with a financial crisis. Such a crisis impedes the planning of a credible long-term strategy for peace. The renewed confidence in the world Organization has generated new demands for peace-keeping operations. The planning and launching of those operations have  as the Secretary-General noted in his report  stretched to the limit the human and financial resources of the Organization. The valuable suggestions of the Secretary-General regarding financial and personnel aspects of the Organization deserve serious consideration  in view of the growing role of the United Nations in world affairs today. Nepal is deeply concerned about the effect of the escalation in the illicit trafficking of drugs on international social and political stability  particularly in Latin America. We greatly appreciate Colombia's determined battle against this scourge. The fight against the lethal menace of drugs demands a concerted international response. The adoption in December 1988 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances is an important step in that direction. My delegation strongly supports the proposal made by His Excellency  Mr. Virgilio Barco Vargas  President of Colombia  to hold a special session of the General Assembly to chart a complete plan of action to eradicate the menace of the illicit trafficking and use of drugs.Terrorism is another grave problem which post-dates the creation of the United Nations but which demands the co-operation of all States in meeting the challenges it poses to international peace and stability. General Assembly resolution 40/61 of 1985 and Security Council resolutions 579 (1985) and 638 (1989) represent the unified stand of the international community on this problem. We must exert every effort to build on this international consensus to strengthen international protection against the scourge of terrorism.Another important issue on the global agenda concerns the development and protection of children. Nepal strongly supports the proposal of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNIÅP) for a world summit on children next year focusing on the rights and needs of children aid on measures better to ensure their development and protection.I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express to members of the Organization our deep appreciation of the trust and confidence they have placed in us by electing Nepal as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. We have tried to live up to this trust to the best of our ability. It has been a particular honour to be on the Council at a time when it has been able to play an important role in establishing a cease-fire in the war between Iran and Iraq aid launch the process of implementing the plan for the independence of Namibia - to name just two important issues on the agenda of the Council.The commitment of Nepal to the principles and purposes of the United Nations is enshrined in the directive principles of the Constitution of Nepal. The Heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries in their recent ninth conference at Belgrade declared that without the United Nations it would not be possible to realize the fullest and broadest possible democratisation of international relations/ which has always been one of the primary objectives of the Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries. Peace and harmony in the world demand that Member States live up fully to their obligations under the Charter. As in the past  we stand ready to join in any concerted endeavour aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the United Nations  convinced as we are that the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations remain the most effective agent to bring about timely  peaceful and meaningful change in promoting development and in restoring faith in the dignity of human persons and of nations. The United Nations was established with the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to promote social progress and better standards of life for all peoples in larger freedom. Today  we have a unique opportunity to begin to translate that vision into reality - a chance to fulfil a 44-yeac-old promise to our peoples - to bring them peace  justice aid a decent standard of living.I appreciate the President's efforts to find a solution for the inevitable urge of delegations to extend greetings. Because I know there is no other speaker after me  may I be permitted to proceed to my delegation's seat by the shortest route. "
"107",5345,"NZL",44,1989,"ï»¿It is a great pleasure to see a distinguished leader such as Ambassador Garba presiding over this Assembly. We have come to know him well from contacts between New Zealand and Nigeria  and we are confident that the Assembly is in very good hands.I last attended the General Assembly in 1985. I was then the Deputy Prime Minister of a recently elected Labour Government. I spoke on behalf of New Zealand in the general debate during the fortieth session. That year  of course  we celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations.We all spoke with pride and enthusiasm about the Charter. We analysed its potential and looked at what had been achieved in the United Nations system over 40 years. And it was true much had been accomplished. But we all knew in our heart of hearts that despite the praise  the plaudits and the peace  it threatened to be a hollow anniversary.The failure to make progress on nuclear disarmament had distorted the fabric of international life. Seemingly intractable conflicts proliferated in many parts of the world. The peace-keeping machinery of the United Nations lay almost dormant and apparently dismissed. In our own region  the South Pacific  we watched anxiously the process of decolonisation and self-determination in New Caledonia  where violence seemed imminent. Sadly  these fears proved well founded. In South Africa  the regime in Pretoria continued year by year its unremitting and abhorrent practice of apartheid and its illegal occupation of Namibia. In 1985 there was all too much evidence that respect for international law and the basic norms of the United Nations Charter were being ignored. We saw the International Court being treated with cynical disdain. There was a steady erosion of State willingness to accept the rule of law and compulsory jurisdiction. New Zealand itself  in 1985  had been the victim of an unlawful act of force during the Rainbow Warrior incident. I was obliged to draw that incident to the Assembly's attention in some detail.But times have changed. Four years later I am back in New York and I find a new picture. We have turned a corner. There have been encouraging signs concerning many of the intractable problems that we faced in 1985. It is a matter of enormous satisfaction to New Zealand that the United Nations  has been a key component in these developments. Even in the darkest days of cynicism about the United Nations  New Zealand stood up and spoke out in support of the United Nations  the Charter principles and the rule of law. We applaud what has happened and what is continuing to happen. Let me cite some examples.In the area of peace-keeping  we see the United Nations proving what can be done  with hard-won progress in the conflict between Iran and Iraq. In southern Africa  a very important step has been taken in Namibia. New Zealand is pleased to have been able to contribute personnel to United Nations forces in both those situations  and also in Afghanistan. In the Pacific  we see grounds for hope in New Caledonia. We look forward to a genuine act of self-determination in accordance with United Nations principles.On disarmament  we have also seen a marked change in the atmosphere  in the attitudes of the two super-Powers. One major agreement has been achieved: the intermediate-nuclear-forces Treaty. Other agreements  on strategic nuclear forces and conventional forces  are being negotiated. We in New Zealand appreciate the complexities of these negotiations. We applaud what has been achieved and what is being done. But our message must continue to be put bluntly: Do not return to the snail's pace of the 1970s and early 1980s. Deep cuts in strategic weapons and conventional forces are urgent. We have a historical opportunity that may not come again for a very long time. If the momentum slows and the moment is lost  history and all humanity will judge those responsible very harshly indeed.I also have to say quite plainly that we remain disappointed that the United Nations plays a less than central role in key disarmament negotiations. The United Nations must be a primary forum for the discussion of disarmament issues and the eventual negotiation of disarmament treaties. New Zealand  together with Australia  has a special interest in promoting  through the United Nations system  progress towards a comprehensive test ban. We again urge in the strongest terms that the powerful few reconsider our resolution with an open mind.New Zealand has a particularly well known position on the question of nuclear weapons. I want to reiterate what I said to the Assembly in 1985:""We have ... declared unambiguously that we do not want any country to defend New Zealand with nuclear weapons ..â We will not have any nuclear weapons on our territory."" (A/40/PV.7  p. 66) Since 1985 this policy has attracted widespread public support in New Zealand. This support continues to grow. It is clearly reflected in public opinion polls. New Zealand is  and will remain  a nuclear-weapon-free State. Consistent with that position we urge  in the strongest terms  that nuclear testing and nuclear weapons themselves be eliminated at the earliest possible date.Another field in which we have observed significant developments in recent years is the rule of international law. It was a matter of great encouragement to many small countries when last year  in the Assembly  President Gorbachev announced that the Soviet Union was adopting a new policy towards the International Court of Justice. We also warmly welcome the fact that the Foreign Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement  at their meeting at The Hague in July  began a constructive analysis of the Court and the role of international law. These developments went further and were reinforced by the welcome news of the recent agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on the compulsory settlement of disputes in the fields of drug trafficking and terrorism. New Zealand urges all countries to review their positions on compulsory jurisdiction and the settlement of disputes by third-party mechanisms. In this context I would also refer to the variety of roles that the Secretary-General can play to resolve disputes.I should also like to acknowledge in this Hall the people in the United Nations system who have done so much to ensure the progress made over the past few years. I do not mean only the staff that supports meetings here and in Geneva. I remember also the unseen United Nations employees and volunteers who work in the field  often in very dangerous environments and suffering considerable hardship  negotiating cease-fires  organizing peace-keeping forces  serving in peace-keeping operations and running emergency relief and development assistance programmes. I want them to know that the people of New Zealand welcome and appreciate their very real contributions.It would be tempting at this point to conclude that the United Nations is in good shape  that things are all headed in the right direction and that we can all go home feeling good about what we have achieved. But that is not the case. The United Nations system is still struggling with major problems. The evil of apartheid is still with us. We have not done enough to reduce poverty and indebtedness. Political solutions still elude us in the Middle East and Cambodia. But I have to tell the Assembly that  in New Zealand's assessment  a much largerproblem has crept up on the world's leaders. It has caught us unawares. The problem I refer to is the health of the planet Earth itself.I know that the United Nations has not ignored the environment. Mr. Tolba and his staff in the United Nations Environment Programme have laboured valiantly. They have had real success on ozone depletion with the Montreal Protocol and  more recently  with the Helsinki Declaration. We in New Zealand have worked very hard indeed to support their efforts  end we shall continue to do so.The general debate is itself demonstrating the growing international concern about the global environment. Action is under way in other parts of the United Nations system as well. A major United Nations conference on environment and development is scheduled for 1992  and it will offer a timely opportunity to take stock of the measures necessary to protect planet Earth.New Zealand strongly endorsed the decision of the UNEP Governing Council in May this year to identify  in preparation for the 1992 conference  the eight critical global environmental problems: atmospheric degradation  fresh-water limitations  pollution of the oceans  deforestation and the others. 1 also want to acknowledge the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is proving to be a very useful and effective mechanism  and New Zealand is playing an active role in its work.All these measures are consuming a great deal of time and energy. Environmental statements  seminars and conferences have become the political flavour of the month. But it sometimes seems that a lot of talk takes the place of action.The 1992 conference will give us an ideal chance to prove to all the doubters and denigrators of the United Nations the real worth of the Organization. Our efforts in the coming weeks must be focused and they must be effective. We need vision  courage and action on the environment  not just talk. I want to ask some hard questions.Politicians are sometimes accused of getting on the green bandwagon because it is politically safe  simplistic and relatively cost-free. But I want to put it to the Assembly that anyone here who believes that environment issues are a soft option is sadly misguided. The global environmental crisis is real. Human development has altered the global ecosystem in which we live. We have been taking the good out of the air  the sea and the land and putting back poison. For most of human history the impact was so slight as to barely affect the balance. But in the last 50 years humanity has wrought havoc on this Earth. We have suddenly come to the knowledge that we can affect the ecological balance very seriously. More frighteningly  we have discovered that the balance has already been changed. The question now is  have we damaged our planet beyond repair? Can we get back to equilibrium? Can we arrest the process of change? The jury  of course  is still out on these questions. If the answer is that the change is irreversible  the ultimate effects could be just as catastrophic for humanity as global nuclear war.I saw a cartoon recently. It pictured some aliens from outer space landing on a ravaged Earth where human life had ceased. One alien says to the other  ""It's too bad. They just achieved general and complete disarmament and some hole in the ozone layer got them"".The message I have for the United Nations system is that we must look urgently at our priorities and our institutions. We must give real priority to the problems of the environment. We must give them attention at least equal to that which we devote to the political and security issues which have mesmerized the United Nations system and Governments for so long.Degradation of the environment is a problem that threatens out security every bit as gravely as the arms race. It affects everyone. But we must recognize that  unlike the issue of nuclear disarmament  where a few very powerful countries have control of the means of destruction  every country in the United Nations  no matter how small  contributes in some way to the threat of environmental destruction. All contribute? all suffer. Pollution recognizes no political boundaries. It is therefore beyond any doubt a problem for the United Nations.	Of course  not every country is equally responsible  and not every country stands to be equally or as rapidly affected. Sometimes the innocent will suffer more than the guilty. It is a fact that more than 80 per cent of the greenhouse gases are produced by a small group of economically privileged countries. It is also a fact that the contribution of the developed world to the depletion of the ozone layer is overwhelming. New Zealand understands the anxiety these facts cause to the peoples of the developing world.We are especially conscious of the plight of the countries of the South Pacific. Last year I represented New Zealand at the South Pacific Forum meeting. We discussed climate change and the disastrous impact of possible sea-level rises. Imagine being the President or leader of an atoll country in the Pacific  such as Tuvalu or Kiribati or Tokelau  and learning that the effluent and by-products of other people's development not only threaten sustainable development in your small island country but indeed threaten to submerge every bit of land on which your people live. Small island communities in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean face similar problems. Pollution could literally wipe them off the face of the Earth.Or imagine representing one of the countries in the South Pacific with few or no natural resources other than the fish in the ocean. You discover that foreign fishermen from outside the region have begun to use in your region a fishing technology not used there before  a technology which threatens to collapse the albacore tuna fishery which is of vital economic importance to the coastal States of the region.I am speaking of the ""wall of death"": the enormous drift-nets which in the last few years have been employed in the South Pacific by distant water fishermen. The technology is not new in itself. What is new  and what  makes it quite unacceptable  is a new technique for the use of drift-nets. This involves several vessels working in co-operation  each deploying a series of very long nets. Each net can be up to 50 kilometres in length. Each vessel sets a number of these nets in a very long line across the ocean. They sometimes cover thousands of kilometres of ocean. In the North Pacific  at the height of the season  an estimated 50 000 kilometres of drift-nets are set nightly. They then drift  literally like a wall of death. They catch and kill  like a vacuum cleaner  virtually every living creature  including some endangered species  that comes in contact with them.The indiscriminate nature of the catch makes this an unacceptable fishing technology. Turtles  whales  dolphins  birds: all are trapped and killed. Large percentages of the catch are lost or wasted when the nets are recovered. In the North Pacific  drift-net fishing has seriously damaged valuable salmon stocks.I have to say that this technology was rejected unanimously by the countries of the South Pacific. In July of this year at the South Pacific Forum meeting at Tarawa  South Pacific Heads of Government adopted a Declaration condemning the practice of large-scale drift-net fishing. But ""wall-of-death"" fishing is not just a moral problem. It is a legal  political and economic problem  and has global implications. Freedom of the high seas cannot be invoked to protect what is in effect a systematic assault on the regional marine ecosystem. There was a time when some argued that freedom of the high seas legitimised unacceptable and illegal practices. But customary international law has responded over the years to outlaw unreasonable and repugnant practices. At the present time  international law is again responding to the unacceptable and unreasonable use of the high seas for drift-net fishing.There is already some evidence of the international community's response to this unreasonable use of the high seas. Many Pacific island States  including New Zealand  have already taken action to outlaw the practice in their domestic regulations and in their 200-mile acres. The Declaration was vigorously supported only four weeks ago at the South Pacific Conference on Nature and Conservation of Protected Areas. It will be reinforced and codified later this year when the South Pacific countries adopt a regional convention to prevent ""wall-of-death"" fishing in our region.I want to make it clear that what is troubling the South Pacific nations is not the practice of small-scale in-shore use of drift-nets of limited size  which are used by various developing countries. Our concern is with the new and highly destructive phenomenon of very long pelagic drift-nets. The Tarawa Declaration called on the international community to support the position of the South Pacific countries on drift-netting. We have asked the Secretary-General to circulate the Tarawa Declaration as a United Nations document for the information of all delegations.The South Pacific will be vigorously pursuing this issue bilaterally  regionally and globally. We will be proceeding in a dispassionate  rational and reasonable way. But those who engage in this ecologically irresponsible activity should be in no doubt that the techniques they use are unacceptable wherever they are used. New Zealand looks to the United Nations to support the Tarawa Declaration. Resolutions in the United Nations system to combat drift-netting are inevitable if these practices are not phased out quickly. New Zealand  in close co-operation with the South Pacific countries and other Members of the United Nations who have declared their abhorrence of the new drift-net technology  will be pursuing this issue within the United Nations system. At the present session opportunities exist under agenda items before several Committees of this Assembly.We note that the Government of the Republic of Korea has temporarily halted drift-net fishing in the South Pacific. That is welcome. We also welcome the decision by Japan in the past few weeks to reduce its drift-net fishing fleet. This is a step in the right direction. But a cessation of this fishing technique is the only ecologically acceptable solution. Only Taiwan has yet to respond to the concerns of the Pacific countries on this matter. We urge all concerned to act quickly. Indeed  the state of our global fisheries is a good example of the broader' environmental problems that our planet is facing.There is really only one international measure regulating fisheries that proceeds on acceptably sound ecosystem principles. That is the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine and Living Resources. In this connection  I would remind the Assembly of the important and valuable environmental protection measures that have been achieved under the Antarctic Treaty  and note that further significant steps will be sponsored by New Zealand at the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Paris next week. The Antarctic Treaty is an effective institution. We are making it even more effective in the environmental field. It is an institution that should be supported by the United Nations General Assembly.Even 20 years ago it was generally assumed that the fish in the open sea were inexhaustible. In general  anyone could go fishing without limitation. Yet we all now know that the biomass of any fishery can easily be over fished. We face a situation where the world's fishing capacity may already be close to  or in excess of  sustainable yield from the commercial fisheries in the world's oceans. We are technically capable of catching fish faster than they can breed. Fishing rights are therefore tightly regulated and licensed. Will we soon have to apply to our atmosphere regulatory principles similar to those we are now applying to out fisheries.I have to say that  if this is the case  then the example we have set with our fisheries is a frightening one. Drift-netting is simply the latest in a long history of irresponsible fishing practices. It is just as well that humanity has not depended on fisheries alone for its survival. The record of international fisheries management is such a sorry one that  if that had been the case  whole populations would have long since perished in the wake of collapsed fisheries.But the reality is that there is no alternative atmosphere to breathe. There is only one global climate. We must do better than the halting attempts at fisheries conservation in that respect. I have some very specific and challenging thoughts about where we go from here to deal with the problems of the global environment generally.The intimate connection between the global environment and the global economy is beyond dispute. It does not need to be argued here. The conclusion of the Brundtland report that development only makes sense if it is sustainable has been widely recognized.The concept of sustainable development is  in its own right  an enormous challenge for the international community. But we must add to that challenge the need to address the disturbances that have been caused to the natural ecosystems. The ozone layer is already seriously depleted. Disposal of hazardous and toxic wastes has become a global threat through dumping in the oceans. We have already witnessed unacceptable attempts to pay developing countries to accept a role as waste receivers. Acid rain and desertification threaten economic progress on several continents  reforestation is limiting the environment's capacity to heal itself and  more importantly  our atmosphere and our climate itself are threatened. Restoring the equilibrium  in all of these areas is going to involve quite significant impacts on the global economy.I do not believe that the full extent of those impacts is yet appreciated by the general public in any of our countries. It is time that ordinary people everywhere stopped and thought for a moment. It is time to acknowledge that we are all adding to the environmental problems every day and that there are no free rides. In the end  we are all going to have to contribute to the solutions  and this will require a major change of attitude all over the world.In this connection I want to pay tribute to the foresight shown by the Prime Ministers of the Netherlands  France and Norway  who in March this year brought together 24 Heads of government to consider the solutions. I was privileged to represent New Zealand at that meeting. We adopted the Hague Declaration. That document called for the development of some very new and important principles to protect the global environment.What then does all this mean in practice? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its Working Groups are focusing on that issue in a great deal of detail. But it seems to me that there are two very clear messages for the future: first  if effective measures are to be taken to reduce greenhouse emissions some quite radical economic measures will be required. Secondly  as is clearly spelt out in the Hague Declaration  some major institutional changes are going; to be required. As to economic measures  these will prove particularly radical for some economic theorists in many countries  including New Zealand. As many of you will know  my Government has drastically reformed the New Zealand economy. We have eliminated subsidies  deregulated commercial activity and reversed the stultifying effects of unnecessary governmental intervention in the economy. And it has proved to be good economic medicine.But it is abundantly clear from the evidence of environmental impacts that the definition of ""necessary governmental intervention"" is going to have to change. Indeed  in New Zealand we have already begun to implement interventions co protect the global environment. The first step was the implementation of the Montreal Protocol in 1988. As a second step  I will shortly be putting before our Parliament legislation going beyond the Montreal Protocol. By 1994 we shall reduce consumption of chlorofluorocarbons to only 5 per cent of 1986 levels  and we shall phase them out altogether by the year 2000. Thirdly  to address our national policies for resource management  I have commissioned the complete overhaul of our law relating to land use  water use  minerals  pollution and hazardous substances  legislation radically reforming all these areas will be submitted to our Parliament before the end of the year. The New Zealand Government will make sustainable development the guiding principle behind decision-making in each of these areas.But it is clear that these interventions will be insignificant by comparison with what will be required to combat the greenhouse effect. I am aware that there are still many unknowns relating to the greenhouse effect  but the evidence overwhelmingly points to the need to act.Effective action will require measures to reduce carbon dioxide and other industrial emissions. We shall have to look at ways to encourage measures of reforestation that absorb carbon dioxide. We shall have to look at energy use  and that will have spin-off implications for economic activity and development throughout all our economies.But there are solutions as well as problems. Radical improvements in energy efficiency and energy conservation make sense economically as well as environmentally. But these alone will not be enough. The United Nations may even need to consider the possibility that  within the limitations of present technology  if development is to be sustainable  it must be rationed - in other words  that humanity has reached the point in history where sustainable development is only possible if ""rights to pollute"" are allocated according to agreed criteria. New Zealand would be the first to acknowledge that this proposition is a frightening one  and it is all the more frightening because of its potential impacts on the aspirations of the developing world for economic and social development.New Zealand understands that we cannot solve global environmental problems unless we can work simultaneously and in a co-ordinated fashion to eradicate poverty. Sustainable development  in its true sense  will require action: to relieve debt burdens; to liberalize multilateral trade; and to promote flows of development assistance without extra conditions. The burdens of improving the global environment must be shared by us all  and they must be shared fairly. That means that some who are already at higher stages of development will have to carry the greatest part of the burden.So clearly we are facing an immensely complex negotiating task. It involves balancing a wide range of technical  scientific and political judgements and meshing them with international economic  trade and aid policies. This is a task which requires the most delicate and co-ordinated oversight. Almost by definition it is beyond the mandate of any existing institution.That brings me to my second major point - institutional reform. We are conscious that a number of proposals have been canvassed in recent times for institutional reform. They range from a new form of Security Council to an ad hoc institution with limited scope and a limited mandate. We are also conscious that existing machinery  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)  the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)  and others  must be given the room and support necessary to achieve their functions while we are discussing the institutional reforms of the future.We accept that reform will have to be evolutionary. But a United Nations declaration on the environment may be needed  and in our view we need a vision that is clear and cogent  because if by 1992 existing institutions are not coping adequately  the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development will need to address squarely the key issue of institutional reform. I have no doubt the issue will not go away. It will have to be faced. In New Zealand's judgement  the traditional response of international law  developing international legal standards in small incremental steps  each of which must subsequently be ratified by all countries  is no longer appropriate to deal with the highly complex environmental problems of the future.The time has come for something more innovative  for a conceptual leap forward in institutional terms. And we see the need for the establishment of a new organ in the United Nations system - perhaps it could be called the ""Environmental Protection Council"". The United Nations already has a Security Council. We also have an Economic and Social Council and a Trusteeship Council. We have two chapters of the United Nations Charter on the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace. We have a chapter laying down the rules and principles with respect to Non-Self-Governing Territories. I have no doubt that if the Charter were being drawn up today  there would be widespread support for including among the organs of the United Nations a body empowered to take binding decisions on global environmental issues. In our view  nothing less than an institution with this status will command the necessary respect and authority to achieve what is required.Perhaps the most effective way to achieve this would be through the inclusion in the United Nations Charter of a new chapter dealing with the environment. Another option would be a major declaration of principle adopted by the United Nations. But we do not envisage any new body replacing UNEP. Far from it. UNEP brings together vital scientific and technical expertise. It has demonstrated both skill and ability in constructing and implementing programmes to analyse global issues and to support operational activities at the regional level. This is a vital function. Not only must it continue  but UNEP's role of developing scientific  technical and policy advice must be enhanced. UNEP may need to be built in as an integral part of the new structure. The missing institutional link  however  is the equivalent of a legislature. We would envisage the new environmental protection council becoming the point in the United Nations system which links the streams of economic and environmental advice. It would perform the function that currently falls between the cracks in the mandates of all the existing organizations. It would have responsibility for taking co-ordinated decisions on sustainable policies for global environmental protection. It would be empowered to take binding decisions. And if decisions are to be binding  the membership of the Council may need to be very wide - perhaps including all Members of the United Nations. But the key thing is that it should have power to act - not just to talk. The time is coming for a bold new step in developing the structures of the United Nations. We must show that the United Nations is ready to meet new challenges and meet them by changing itself to cope with the needs of humanity in the course of the next century.In 1945  the present Charter was born out of the conviction that the horrors of the Second World War must never be repeated. The environmental challenge which we now face may be every bit as devastating for humanity. Let us hope that we have learned from the past and that it will prove possible to put in place effective institutions now  rather than repeat the sad experience of the League of Nations  a well-meaning but inadequate institution. If we wait for the aftermath of an ecological disaster  it may be too late.May I conclude with a quotation from one of my predecessors  Prime Minister Peter Fraser  who in his statement at San Francisco  on 1 May 1945  at the adoption of the present Charter  had this to say:""The failure of the League of Nations  one of the noblest conceptions in the history of mankind  was a moral failure on the part of the individual members  and was not due to any fundamental defect of the machinery of the League. [It] failed because its members would not perform what they undertook to perform. It failed because of the recession that took place in public morality ... It failed because the rule of expediency replaced that of moral principles.""I would therefore stress that unless in the future we have the moral rectitude end determination to stand by our engagements and our principles  then ... this new organization will avail us nothing  the sufferings and the sacrifices our people have endured will avail us nothing  and the countless lives of those who have died in this struggle for security and freedom will have been sacrificed in vain.""These words are a solemn reminder to us all that in the end it is not only a question of institutions  of conventions and protocols. It is  in the final analysis  the scourge of pollution  like the scourge of war  that can arid will destroy us unless we are willing to put principle above expediency. Strong medicine is called for a sick planet. We have no choice. And if we take no action  we will have no future."
"108",5390,"OMN",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to offer Ambassador Garba of Nigeria our sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We are fully confident that with his wide experience and eminent expertise he will conduct the work of the session with the greatest skill. I should also like to thank his predecessor  representing the fraternal Argentine Republic  for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly.One of the most conspicuous and distinctive features of the United Nations is the work of the General Assembly at its regular annual sessions  together with the valuable discussions that take place in the search for the optimum means of preserving international peace and security and promoting international co-operation as the major objectives that the principles of the United Nations and its Charter strive to achieve.It can be said that a greater measure of peace prevails in the world at present  despite the continued existence of focal points of regional and international conflicts and disputes resulting from the fact that a number of Member States fail to honour their international commitments and obligations. Our efforts must therefore focus on eliminating the difficulties that prevent the resolution of those situations so that such peace as we now experience will not once more be transformed into a state of heated confrontation.Taking this as our point of departure it is necessary for us to expand the scope of international consultation with regard to all remaining problems. We must encourage or bring pressure to bear on parties that continue to ignore the role of the United Nations and finally  to agree to work within the framework of international legitimacy. With the easing of formerly strained relations between the forces of East and West  and in particular between the two super-Powers  a global dialogue has been instituted so that the message of peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes have begun to make their presence felt from Kampuchea to Afghanistan and from the Arabian Gulf to southern Africa. This positive climate and the international momentum generated by the beginning of the end of polarization have both opened up new prospects that must be sustained by one and all and by all available means.Peace will continue to be the pre-eminent goal that my country strives to achieve through its policies in general. In the light of that attitude  the Sultanate has devoted all available resources to alleviating tension in the region in an endeavour to secure a peace built on good-neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence among all peoples. The Sultanate of Oman has from the outset adhered to the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes in its relations with its neighbours as one of the principal foundations of its foreign policy. We are happy to see that that principle has now become a positive phenomenon at the international level and is becoming prevalent in endeavours to contain numerous regional problems and disputes.It is evident that the momentum produced by the global dialogue has given hope to the peoples of the Gulf region for the consolidation of peace and co-operation. Under the auspices of the Secretary-General  the negotiations between Iraq and Iran on the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) are still continuing with a view to bringing about a durable peace between those two countries. However  despite the lapse of more than 12 months since the first round of negotiations began  the only provision of resolution 598 (1987) to have been implemented is the provision recruiting the commitment of both parties to a cease-fire. At the forty-third session of the General Assembly  we were hopeful that by the present session the Secretary-General and the two parties to the conflict would have been able to secure the full implementation of resolution 598 (1987) which we believe to be binding since both parties concerned have pledged that they will meet their international obligations.We are fully aware that each party faces difficulties and that each of them has compelling grounds for adhering to its own viewpoint and its own interpretation of the provisions of the resolution. We nevertheless believe that the need to achieve peace  as well as adherence to the spirit of international legitimacy  to the principles that underlie the rules of international law and to the accepted precedents with regard to regional conflicts  must be adopted as the paradigm for the thinking of the two sides as well as in the negotiations between them. We believe that it is the responsibility of the Security Council to assist the two parties to the conflict to reach an understanding of the principles on which Security Council resolution 598 (1987) is based because that will enable the Secretary-General to present a uniform concept to both parties to the dispute instead of having each of the parties present him with a conflicting perception of the same resolution.It is incumbent on us all to urge both Iraq and Iran to co-operate with the Secretary-General and with the Security Council in order to ensure the implementation of the resolution in question. We are prompted to make this assertion by the belief that the leaders of both countries have a strong desire for peace and that the climate of public opinion in both countries and the deep sentiments and common interests that link the peoples of Iraq and Iran are all factors that go to form a fitting backdrop for co-operation which must inevitably have a positive influence for peace. In the Middle East the question of Palestine remains without that political solution which would secure the legitimate political and human rights of the fraternal Palestinian people  a people which suffered a calamity some 40 years ago and which continues to confront an unknown destiny. The United Nations faces a severe test of its credibility with respect to the achievement of peace and security in the Middle East. One wonders how long the deteriorating situation that portends insufferable consequences in Palestine can be tolerated  and how long it is possible to acquiesce in Israeli policies in the Arab territories occupied since 1967.By its rejection of Arab and international proposals for the convening of an international peace conference so that a durable solution can be sought guaranteeing peace and stability to all the peoples of the region  Israel is jeopardizing the peace and security of the Middle East. Israel's persistence in pursuing an arbitrary and obdurate policy towards the Palestinian people  Israel's denial of national and human rights of that people whether by direct force of arms or by intimidation  are unacceptable to the civilized world.In the international information media  the world daily witnesses the bloody and unequal confrontations between defenceless Palestinians - men  women and children rising in revolt in order to regain their usurped rights - and the Israeli army fully equipped with the most sophisticated weaponry and occupying Arab territory in defiance of the will of the international community.In the declarations made by its leaders  Israel has frequently asserted that it takes no heed of  and indeed has no regard for  the will of the international community whenever that will conflicts with its ambitions and interests. Israel  by its conduct  has also demonstrated that it has no respect whatever for international law and custom. If it had  then what law could it be that accords Israel the right to detain Palestinians for a full year without trial in their own occupied territory? On what code of law does Israel base itself in demolishing the homes of Palestinian citizens and expelling them from their homeland for no other reason than their rejection of Israeli domination and occupation?The international community must act to halt these unlawful and inhuman practices. The time has come for Israel to yield to logic. It is time for Israel to enter into dialogue with the representatives of the Palestinian people? and it is the international conference  enjoying as it does the blessing of the international community  which provides the most appropriate forum for such a dialogue. If Israel persists in rejecting the logic of peace  then the Middle East will constantly remain a cause of concern and a source of danger to international peace and security.It is a matter for regret that the international community should remain silent before Israel's refusal to implement those Security Council resolutions calling for the full and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied Lebanese territory as a first step towards the restoration of Lebanon's unity  security and stability. We commend the efforts made by the Tripartite Arab Committee set up to resolve the Lebanese crisis  and we call upon our brothers in Lebanon  of all religious and political persuasions  to rally together and to place the best interest of their country above all other interests and considerations so that Lebanon may surmount its constitutional crisis and once again become the symbol of peace  love and brotherhood it once was.My country recognizes and believes in the need for the peaceful settlement of disputes on a basis of mutual respect  non-interference in the internal affairs of others and self-determination. It is for this reason that the Sultanate of Oman welcomed and gave its support to the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan signed on 14 April 1988. The Sultanate of Oman hails the completion of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from that country. We consider the withdrawal an important and fundamental step which has helped bring about a rapprochement of viewpoints among the various factions in Afghanistan  a step which has opened the way for the Afghan people to choose the system that it itself desires without outside interference. The Sultanate of Oman is hopeful that the parties concerned will succeed in forming a government that will bring together all segments of the Afghan people and that will endeavour to bring about the return of the Afghan refugees to their homes  preserve the Islamic identity and neutrality of Afghanistan and establish the necessary relations of good-neighbourliness with contiguous States  including the Soviet Union.The ASEAN States have made exhaustive efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the Kampuchean problem. The Sultanate of Oman  commends those efforts  and particularly those made by Indonesia in this connection and regards the outcome of the international Conference on Kampuchea recently held at Paris as auspicious. We are fully confident that the results will lead to the inception of a new era for the Kampuchean people enabling that people to bring down the curtain on the tragedies of the past and begin to rebuild its country under a system of government chosen by itself for itself. Despite the fact that the Paris Conference did not achieve any concrete progress  it is important that a dialogue continue among all parties so that a political solution to the Kampuchean problem be achieved.On the threshold of the 1990s  we find ourselves imbued with a sense of optimism with regard to the role of diplomacy and negotiation as valuable and prestigious instruments in international relations. We had hoped that the new turn towards optimism in international relations would make a significant and decisive contribution to the future of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean so that the relevant conference could be held in Colombo in 1990 as a first step towards the implementation of the 1971 Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace  adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 2832 (XXVI). However  the difficulties raised by some States may prevent this. We call upon those States to adopt a spirit of conciliation and to allow efforts to be stepped up so that the conference can be held as scheduled.The world has rejoiced that agreement has been reached which will lead to the independence of Namibia. We should therefore particularly like to congratulate the people of Namibia and the African nations on the Namibian people's achievement. After 74 years of colonialism as inhabitants of a mandated Territory  the people of Namibia has now begun to reap the fruits of its struggle and its sacrifices. As we salute and revere the efforts of all those who have contributed to giving effect to Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  we should also like to take this opportunity to express our pleasure at the success of the summit meeting recently held in Zaire  at which a settlement was reached by the conflicting parties in Angola. We are prompted by the hope that this agreement will be a good omen not only for Angola but for the region as a whole.Despite the progress of peace in Namibia and Angola  the prospects for peace in southern Africa remain indistinct because of the South African regime's continued pursuit of the policy of racial discrimination against the black majority. We shall support the international efforts aimed at achieving justice and equality among all members of the population  and we hope that those efforts will achieve tangible progress in the near future. Events in Central America have shown that peace can be achieved through diplomacy and negotiation. We are confident that the leaders of the region recognize the importance of ensuring a climate of good-neighbourliness among the States of Central America that would lay the appropriate groundwork to support the efforts of the Contadora Group and implement the Esuipulas II accords so that the long-standing instability in the region may be ended.Last year  Seoul  the capital of South Korea  witnessed a remarkable summer Olympiad that was most in harmony with the universality that also constitutes one of the major pillars of the United Nations.In accordance with that principle  and because of the importance of such a step in alleviating tension and promoting the peace process in the peninsula  we welcome any international effort made to ensure the representation of both Koreas in our Organization and to grant them full membership.With regard to the question of Cyprus  while we express our regret that the two parties to the conflict were unable to reach a negotiated solution to the problem last June  we nevertheless hope that the leaders of the Turkish and Greek communities will show the greatest degree of co-operation and flexibility in the coming rounds of talks  so that the members of both communities may once again live together side by side in peace  security  and tranquillity.The dangers posed by the unsound environmental policies pursued by certain industrialized countries have given rise to a disturbance in the ecological balance  the extinction of certain plant and animal species necessary to maintain natural life on our planet and  in many regions  the pollution of the seas to a most hazardous extent.My country  following the guidelines laid down by His Majesty Sultan Qabcos bin Said  accords the utmost importance to environmental protection. My country was and continues to be a pioneer in enacting legislation and adopting initiatives  particularly at the regional level  for the elaboration of optimum methods of solving environmental problems.The Sultanate of Oman therefore supports the convening of the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development at the earliest possible opportunity. The conference should review and appraise achievements in the field of environmental preservation  formulate solutions to the challenges that mankind will face in that domain  and reassess priorities in such a manner as to ensure the continuity of international efforts to create a better environment for future generations.Mankind has made unprecedented progress in opening up new horizons in technology. However  most scientific achievements are unfortunately devoted to advancing the arms race and even to the manufacture and development of devices that threaten the survival of mankind itself  such as nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.The very existence of such lethal weapons is the greatest danger threatening mankind. Therefore  any talk of halting the proliferation of such weapons is out of joint if it is not within the context of their complete elimination. It is the international community's endeavour to achieve this end that prompted it warmly to welcome and support the agreement reached between the two super-Powers at the end of 1987 on the elimination of their medium-range and shorter-range missiles from Europe as a first step towards nuclear disarmament. In that connection  we welcome the measures recently agreed upon by the two Powers with regard to disarmament.Bilateral disarmament negotiations  although extremely important  should not detract from the role of multilateral negotiations nor be seen as a substitute for them? the two should rather complement each other. The question of disarmament is not one that concerns certain States alone. It is an issue that impinges on the interests and the very existence of all mankind. We must therefore make the greatest possible efforts to support United Nations endeavours relating to disarmament issues and especially those involving the future of mankind  such as the prevention of the outbreak of nuclear war and the imposition of a comprehensive nuclear test ban. Agreement on those questions can release enormous resources which if used in the proper manner - for development - would change the world situation and make it more secure  more peaceful and more prosperous.It is saddening that the momentum produced by recent United Nations successes in solving regional problems has not been exploited for the achievement of corresponding progress and success at the level of the international economy.The economies of the developing world are suffering grave problems. Average annual rates of real growth in those countries fell from 5.5 per cent in the 1970s to less than 3 per cent in the 1980s. The share of third-world countries in the developed market economies fell from 38 per cent in 1970 to only 19 per cent in 1987  while that of the industrialized countries rose from 65 per cent to 71 per cent over the same period. If to the problem of reduced income are added the indebtedness problem of the developing countries  which has now surpassed the $1 billion mark  the deterioration in the terms of trade to their detriment  the drop in the prices of the primary commodities on which the economies of those countries depend and the protectionist measures imposed  then it is abundantly clear that we remain far from achieving a better economic order that would narrow the existing economic gap between developing and developed countries.The factors that have prevented the international community from realizing the economic achievements to which it might have aspired during the 1980s must  on the threshold of the 1990s  provide us with the strongest motivation to make the greatest possible efforts to establish a just economic order that takes account of  the economic conditions of the emerging developing countries. Among the priorities for such efforts must be the formulation of a fair and thoroughgoing solution to the debt crisis  which still threatens to undermine stability at the national and international levels. We regard the three-point plan of action  presented by the brotherly State of Kuwait and delivered by His Highness the Amir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah at the forty-third session of the United Nations General Assembly  as an important initiative that must be supported. Action should be taken to implement it in order that a solution to the international debt crisis be found. We must here commend the policy announced by the French Government absolving the least developed countries of all their debts  and we can only welcome the agreement recently reached on Mexico's debts. This constitutes an auspicious precedent with regard to the problem of indebtedness in general.We support the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries. Such a session will provide an opportunity to initiate a dialogue on the reversal of the present downward trend in the world economy  which will only come about through a strong demonstration of collective political will  and of the belief that it is not possible for the world to live in peace if a tiny minority of the human race possesses all the attributes of affluence while the majority lacks even the most elementary requirements of life. We are living in an epoch in which the United Nations has begun to contribute with increasing effectiveness to the solution of a number of international problems  and we call for support for efforts to continue this positive momentum. We are also hopeful that  through this Organization  we will be able to devise just and peaceful solutions to the various issues which are a source of concern to the international community and which threaten international peace and security  such as the question of the Palestinian people and the conduct of the racist regime in South Africa. We further hope that increased and more earnest efforts will be made to channel the enormous scientific and technological progress being made into building a better tomorrow for future generations instead of the contrivance of ever more means of destruction.The Sultanate of Oman believes that the United Nations has the necessary attributes to enable it to play an important role in this field  and we shall spare no effort to contribute to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations.In conclusion  we hope that the deliberations of the present session will strengthen co-operation and promote detente in international relations and that the resolutions adopted by the Assembly will be of a practical character so that they may contribute successfully to addressing the issues included in this session's agenda."
"109",5436,"PAK",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to offer you  on behalf of the Pakistan delegation  warm and sincere felicitations on your election as President of the Ganeral Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your unanimous election was a tribute to you  as well as recognition of the important role played by Nigeria in promoting international peace  security and progress. Relations between our two countries  which we highly treasure  have always been marked by friendship  understanding and co-operation. We are confident that you will guide the deliberations of the Assembly with distinction. I should like to express our deep appreciation for the leadership provided by your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo  in presiding over the previous session of the General assembly.I should like also to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his untiring efforts to promote the [ purposes and principles of the United Nations and the cause of international peace. Under his leadership the United Nations has emerged as a credible and effective instrument for the promotion and maintenance of peace around the world. Pakistan will continue to extend to him full co-operation for the consolidation of international peace  security and progress.I am honoured to bring to this body the greetings of the people and the Government of Pakistan. A new era of democracy was ushered in by the people of Pakistan last December  after a long and arduous struggle  through a peaceful electoral process. A new spirit pervades our society. Our people are confident  our political institutions are thriving  our judiciary is independent and our information media are free.The Government's commitment to the ideals and principles of democracy is matched by an equally firm commitment to promoting the welfare of the people. Since assuming office. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has devoted her energies to improving the lot of the poor masses. The Government has launched comprehensive programmes for the eradication of poverty  the elimination of illiteracy  the provision of shelter aid basic health care  the integration of women in development and the protection of human rights. It has also declared war on drug trafficking and drug abuse.The people of Pakistan rejoice in the world-wide triumph of democracy and freedom. It is a measure of her commitment to strengthening democracy in Pakistan and elsewhere that the Prime Minister of Pakistan proposed in June this year the establishment of an association of democratic nations. The cultural  historical and ideological ethos of different countries leads them to choose the models of popular participation best suited to their circumstances. The proposal seeks to bring together democracies so they may draw strength from each other and work jointly for the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We believe that the consolidation of democratic principles will strengthen the United Nations and the cause of international peace and stability.As we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century  the world is undergoing a profound transformation. The East-West dialogue has eased international tension  and the confrontation of the past could well be replaced by a spirit of constructive competition and co-operation. A number of regional conflicts appear to be yielding to the growing international resolve to settle disputes by peaceful means.While some troubled areas in the world have witnessed an appreciable movement towards peaceful conditions  others continue to be marked by strife. Afghanistan is unfortunately one of those countries where peace has not yet returned. I do not wish to dwell on the past. Suffice it to say that while the epic struggle of the heroic people of Afghanistan led to the withdrawal of foreign troops  that could not by itself lead to a resolution of the problem. The Geneva accords of April 1988 did not constitute a comprehensive settlement  since they addressed the external aspects of the problem.The framework for an internal settlement has been provided by the General Assembly in resolution 43/20  which called for the establishment of a bread-based government in Afghanistan acceptable to the people of Afghanistan  the voluntary return of over 5 million Afghan refugees to their homeland  aid the free exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of Afghanistan - elements essential to a comprehensive political settlement. The formation of ai Afghan Interim Government in February this year marked an important step towards the objective of setting up a broad-based government in Afghanistan.The Kabul regime has been rejected by the Afghan people and is sustained within a few strongholds through massive infusions of Soviet arms. No representative group or segment of the Afghan population is willing to enter into negotiations or share power with the Kabul regime  which is held responsible for the death and destruction caused by the conflict in Afghanistan during the past decade. The solution lies in the transfer of power to a broad-based government acceptable to the Afghan people. The discredited Kabul regime has  however  refused to transfer power peacefully  in a major propaganda offensive it has made self-serving proposals intended to legitimize it. Those proposals have been rejected by the Afghan people. The Kabul regime  having failed to hoodwink the Afghan people or the international community  has chosen the path of war in a desperate bid for survival.It is indeed ironic that the Kabul regime  which is responsible for the continuation of the conflict in Afghanistan  should seek to shift the blame to Pakistan by levelling baseless allegations of interference and violations of the Geneva accords. All such allegations have been investigated by the united Nations good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan  and none has been substantiated.Not content with its false propaganda  the Kabul regime has sought to pressure Pakistan through Scud missile attacks  ground and air violations and acts of sabotage. Pakistan will not be intimidated and will remain steadfast in its quest for a comprehensive political settlement of the Afghanistan problem. We shall continue to lend full support to the Secretary-General in his efforts to bring about such a settlement.We are confident that this Assembly will reiterate its call for a comprehensive settlement of the Afghanistan issue  including the establishment of a broad-based government in Kabul acceptable to the people of Afghanistan  voluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland  and the free exercise of the right to self-determination by the Afghan people.In Kampuchea  as in Afghanistan  foreign military intervention resulted in the imposition of am illegal and unrepresentative regime. We are disappointed at the failure of the Paris Conference on Kampuchea. That failure was due primarily to the attempts by the regime in Kampuchea to legitimize the consequences of foreign military intervention. It is our earnest hope that a comprehensive political settlement will soon be arrived at  resulting in the free exercise of the right to self-determination by the people of Kampuchea after the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces.The tragedy of the people of Palestine endures. Israel continues to deny the inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and remains in illegal occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories. The people of Palestine have waged a heroic struggle for the restoration of their national rights. Unarmed Palestinian youths have stood firm in the face of the full might of tine callous aid brutal Israeli armed forces  which have resorted to murder  mass detentions  deportations  blowing up the homes of Palestinians  closing their educational institutions aid strangling their economic life. Pakistan condemns those Zionist atrocities.A just and durable solution of the problem is possible only throucfa the unconditional and total withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  including Al-Quds al-Sharif  and the restoration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establish an independent State of their own in Palestine  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  their sole and legitimate representative. We believe that this can best be achieved through an international conference on the Middle East with the full participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization on an equal footing.The proclamation of the State of Palestine and the initiatives of the PID for a peaceful settlement have been widely welcomed throughout the world. The international community  aid particularly the friends of Israel  must persuade Israel to respond in a positive manner to these initiatives.Nothing is more repugnant to the human spirit than the spectacle of a society organized on the basis of racist doctrines. The racist  minority  illegal regime in Pretoria continues to practise the odious system of apartheid with brutal force and intensity. This has left the long-suffering people of South Africa no option but to intensify their struggle against the racist regime. It is our firm conviction that the irrepressible demand of the majority community of South Africa for equality  liberty and majority rule cannot be suppressed for long. The Government of Pakistan fully supports their valiant struggle for freedom  equality and dignity. We support the demand of the international community for the imposition of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist Pretoria regime till the eradication of apartheid and the establishment of majority rule in South Africa.We must ensure that there is no retrogression in areas where the United Nations has achieved success in promoting peaceful solutions to raging conflicts. With the approaching independence of Namibia a stronghold of colonialism is nearing its end. The valiant and protracted struggle of the people of Namibia  under the dynamic leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  supported by the united Nations has paved the way for Namibia's independence. The international community must ensure that the independence plan is scrupulously adhered to by South Africa and all practices in contravention of the letter and spirit of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) cease forthwith. Pakistan is proud to be associated with the implementation of the independence plan under the aegis of the United Nations through the contribution of personnel to the united Nations Transition Assistance Group. The day is not far off when Namibia will occupy its rightful place as an independent State in the comity of nations.We remain hopeful that the peace talks between Iran and Iraq under united Nations auspices for the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) will lead to a just  comprehensive and durable settlement and that the two countries will be able to devote their energies to the gigantic task of economic and social reconstruction.An area that deserves the urgent attention of the United Nations is that of the plight of minorities in many parts of the world where they are denied their fundamental human rights and are treated as outcasts  fair game for discriminatory treatment. The States whose citizens they are must provide them full protection. If the States concerned should fail to do so or indeed should become the tormentors themselves  it is the duty of the international community to demonstrate effectively its concern for the hapless and unfortunate minorities. We are particularly concerned at this juncture over the travail of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria. More than 300( 000 Bulgarian Muslims have been forced to take refuge in Turkey. We hope that the policy of forced assimilation which has led to this exodus aid has evoked world-wide concern will be abandoned aid the human rights of the Bulgarian Muslims respected.The positive developments in the political arena between the East and the West are not  unfortunately  reflected in the field of international economic relations  particularly between the North and the South. Despite a recognition of the growing interdependence of the world economy the divide between the rich and the poor nations continues to widen  dialogue remains stalled  and the economic problems of the developing world remain unaddressed.Many eminent leaders from developing countries have articulated from this rostrum their deepening concern over the continuing economic crisis in the third world. The socio-political consequences of this crisis for the developing economies are only too well known. The fundamental issue facing the developing world is a simple one - its inability to foster socio-economic progress and welfare in ai uncongenial external economic environment.The economic situation of many developing countries has deteriorated and the number of people living below the poverty line has increased. Reduced external assistance  debt-servicing  low commodity prices  adverse terms of trade and increased protectionism have resulted in massive reverse financial flows. The economies of a large number of developing countries have thus been drained and the process of development brought to a standstill.The third world countries continue to impress upon the industrialized North the need  in an increasingly interdependent world  to resolve international economic issues through dialogue. However  all efforts to revive the North-South dialogue have foundered because of the negative attitude of the North. Major industrialized countries are impervious to our concerns. The third world has at best a marginal role in international economic and financial decision-making.The external debt burden of the third world countries reached the astronomical figure of 31.32 trillion in 1988. We believe that an equitable solution of the debt problem must be devised which would allow reasonable economic growth aid avoid disrupting the political and social fabric of the debtor nations. Debt relief measures should apply to both official and commercial debts. Countries which have managed their external debts efficiently should not be penalized by being excluded from debt-relief measures. Development assistance must also be enhanced.The protectionist policies of the developed countries support inefficient local industry  run contrary to the principle of comparative advantage  reduce world productivity and act as a serious obstacle in the way of the economic development of the developing countries. Tariff and non-tariff barriers against imports from the developing countries are erected by those very countries which advocate the merits of free-market economies. It is time for them to lead by example rather than by precept and to dismantle these barriers. It is also our hope that the current Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) will not be extended further after it expires in 1991. It is time to resume the dialogue. The special session devoted to international economic co-operation and the revitalization of economic growth end development of the developing countries  scheduled for 1990  will provide an opportunity for the adoption of concrete measures to redress the structural problems besetting international economic relations. Simultaneously  serious attention must be devoted to the elaboration of the international development strategy for the fourth united Nations development decade.The protection and preservation of the environment is indeed a shared objective. Pakistan  for its part  has consistently supported international efforts to this end. We believe  however  that the improvement of the environment is closely linked to the eradication of poverty. There is thus an inherent relationship between environmental improvement and economic development. It is equally important that the developed countries should provide the technology and the financial resources to the developing countries to fight environmental degradation  while sustaining  if not accelerating  their economic growth. Furthermore  the environment should not be the only subject on the North-South agenda. The entire range of economic issues must be discussed  with a view to finding common solutions.Pakistan has always been in the forefront of efforts to promote international peace and security and to remove the nuclear threat that hangs over humanity. We therefore welcomed the commencement of talks between the united States and the Soviet Union on the reduction of their strategic nuclear weapons. It is our expectation that the talks will lead to a substantial reduction of the nuclear arsenals of the two super-Powers and ultimately to the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Pending the achievement of this ultimate objective  effective and legally  binding international arrangements must be worked out to assure all non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of the use of nuclear weapons.It is a matter for some regret that the conclusion of a comprehensive nucler~test-ban treaty  which is an essential first step towards halting and reversing the nuclear-arms race  has remained elusive. We strongly urge the early adoption of such a treaty.Pakistan has consistently supported negotiations at the global level for progress towards general aid complete disarmament. However  we recognize that progress towards this goal is likely to be slow. Meanwhile  it is desirable for peace-loving countries to consider measures for disarmament at the regional level  with a view to strengthening regional peace and stability.It cannot be denied that the sense of insecurity experienced by the smaller States usually emanates from within their region itself. The origin of such insecurity lies in a variety of factors  including unresolved territorial disputes  ambitions for regional dominance  hegemonic designs and interventionist policies. Further  the security concerns of States differ from region to region  depending upon the nature of their threat perceptions. Therefore  a regional approach offers the most realistic prospect of rapid progress towards disarmament. We believe that confidence-building and disarmament negotiations should be pursued simultaneously at both the global aid the regional levels.Pakistan abides by the concept of nuclear non-proliferation  but it also expects the nuclear Powers to reciprocate  by eliminating their own nuclear-weapon stocks. Nor should the concept of non-proliferation be used as a pretext to prevent developing countries from pursuing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Let me reiterate once again that Pakistan's nuclear programme is devoted entirely to peaceful purposes.Our commitment to keeping our region free of nuclear weapons has led us to propose that  pending the adoption of a global treaty  regional or bilateral test-ban agreements may be concluded. In the same spirit  Pakistan has made a number of proposals  including the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia  a proposal which has been repeatedly endorsed by the General Assembly.We support all steps to prevent an arms race in outer space. We attach equal importance to the early conclusion of a convention prohibiting the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.Negotiations for conventional disarmament at the global aid regional levels must also be pursued vigorously  with a view to ensuring undiminished security of the States concerned at the lowest level of armaments and military expenditures. This objective has become all the more important because of the increasing sophistication and destructive power of conventional weapons.Naval disarmament has also acquired urgency in view of the rapid growth in the naval flotillas of some States  including the introduction of nuclear-powered submarines. This trend is a cause of serious concern  as it may lead to an arms race in this field at a qualitatively higher level and scale.Since its independence Pakistan has steadfastly pursued the goal of improving the security environment in its neighbourhood  lb that end  we have made consistent efforts to develop good-neighbourly and co-operative relations with all our neighbours  including India  based on the principles of sovereign equality aid non-interference in the internal affairs of other States. In the spirit of the Simla Agreement  we shall continue to seek a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions  which recognize the right of the people of the State to decide their future. The agreement on non-attack on each other's nuclear facilities  signed between India and Pakistan in December 1988  constitutes a significant confidence-building measure  which will have a stabilizing effect on the security situation in South Asia. We  on our part  are prepared to enter into negotiations for other similar measures. It is our hope that India will respond positively to our initiatives aid proposals aimed at strengthening regional peace and security.The South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) offers an excellent opportunity to its member States to forge greater co-operation between themselves. The Fourth SAARC Summit  held in Islamabad in December last year  took a number of momentous decisions on evolving regional approaches to common problems. The designation of 1989 as the SAARC year for combating drug abuse and drug trafficking underscored the joint commitment of the South Asian countries to eliminate this scourge from our region.The role of the united Nations in the maintenance of international peace and stability is indispensable. We welcome the successful role played by the united Nations in resolving disputes and conflicts between its Member States. The United Nations must also provide the platform for developing a partnership between the rich and the poor. Let us pledge to make this world body stronger  so that it may address itself effectively to issues of universal concern. It is only through recognition of the common destiny of mankind and a co-operative approach in resolving the problems facing us that we can hope to usher in a progressive world order  based on peace  security and justice.

"110",5479,"PAN",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of Panama I should like to convey to you our heartfelt congratulations on your well-deserved election  which has put in very capable hands the responsibility of directing the debates of the General Assembly. In offering to you  Sit  the President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly the support and co-operation of the Panamanian delegation  we acknowledge that the success of its work will depend in great measure on your vast experience and known dedication  particularly in matters concerning the solution to problems of great significance to the Members of the Organization  such as safeguarding peace and the sharing of efforts leading to the eradication of that affront to humanity apartheid. Your inaugural address revealed a clear perception of the problems of the third world  which gives us renewed hope for the fulfilment of our tasks in the Assembly.I am also pleased to congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff for the excellent report he has made available to us on the work of the Organization. Its contents are clear proof of the arduous and intelligent work that has been done to solve some of the most difficult problems confronting our world today. As Provisional President of the Republic of Panama  1 shall now refer to a matter of importance  especially to small nations  and reiterate denunciations and concepts that have been expressed by other Panamanian rulers before this forum for the greater part of this decade.Indeed  once more we denounce the continued violation by the Government of the United States of the terms of the Panama Canal Treaties. It is disrespectfully ignoring the norms of international law which relate to civilized coexistence among sovereign States. Not even the Host Coin try Agreement between the United Nations and the United States Government has been able to curtail the cruelty with which we are being persecuted. Panamanian diplomats and officials with me here are not all of those who were to accompany me. Entry visas to the United States were refused to the others. Prior to this  a visa was also denied to a Panamanian Ambassador on special mission for the meeting of the Security Council on 11 August this year  in violation of the obligations of the United States Government to the Organization.Denunciations presented by Panama - even before the current crisis in Panamanian-United States relations - in this and other world forums  still prevail concerning the so-called Law 96-70 passed by the United States Congress  as well as the other impositions and practices which this aid previous Governments have used insistently to avoid compliance with such Treaties  undermining my country's sovereignty  security and economy  in detriment of the interests aid security of the international community  which benefits from the services of the Canal.During the past 27 months my country has been subjected to the most intense disinformation campaign concerning its reality in order to discredit its Government authorities aid to undermine our national struggles. This is part of a brutal programme of political  diplomatic and financial pressures  interference in our internal affairs  intimidation and military threats. The aim is to subjugate us by denigrating  isolating aid impoverishing our people  in order to subvert the institutional order of the Republic and place us at the will of United States regional strategy.These facts demonstrate that there are still centres of power in the world which make it difficult and costly for a small nation to cling to its identity and procure its own social and political answers according to its human idiosyncrasies and in search of its own destiny.Nevertheless  notwithstanding these obstacles  in the last years of the decade of the 1960s  a transformation movement was instituted in Panama  a movement which did not fit traditional schemes.In 1968  under the leadership of General Omar Torrijos  Panama began a new governmental effort whose principal characteristics were a marked emphasis on popular reforms freeing the people from ignorance  from backwardness and from despair; in other words  a process of democratising the opportunities of progress and welfare for all sectors of our society.However  our effort was viewed not only as dangerous  but as ever more dangerous  because one could not wave the banner of anti-communism against it.The social results of the last two decades are self-evident. In 1968  life expectancy at birth for a Panamanian was 64.3 years; in 1987  when the stage of open aggression was reached  life expectancy was 72 years. Infant mortality  which had been 51.6 per thousand live births  had been reduced to 22.9. We increased the medical facilities from 189 to 608. The percentage of population covered by our social security programme  which includes free medical and dental care and had been 18.5 per cent  reached 62.5 per cent. The percentage of population to which drinking water was available climbed from 65 per cent to 86.2 per cent. Enrolment of university students in 1968 was 11 992; in 1987 it had reached 56 567  while the rate of illiteracy went from 20.7 per cent in 1970 to 13.2 per cent  according to the 1980 census. And in this decade  literacy programmes have multiplied and telephone service and electric power have been extended to practically the entire country.To this we should add that in June 1987 projections for real economic growth were estimated at 6 per cent  one of the highest in Latin America for that year. As a result of aggression  the national economy experienced extraordinary losses: an estimated 20 per cent reduction in the gross national product and of 40 per cant reduction in tax revenues  and a doubling of the unemployment rate. Thousands of small businesses went bankrupt  more than 70 000 workers lost their jobs  and there was a shortage of basic food products  medicines and hospital equipment. Aggression was meant to impose suffering upon our people in order to modify their political conduct.To these actions we must add the extreme interference in the internal affairs of our country. Among other things  the Government in Washington seized funds belonging to the Panamanian nation in the United States  ordered its companies and the Panama Canal Commission to with old payment of taxes to Panama  aid suspended making payments to which it is committed pursuant not only to the Treaties subscribed to by both countries but also to the laws of the United States. To this we add the orders given to United States capital firms in our country illegally to sequester bank monies aid to impede payments to those on a blacklist of functionaries and others accused of continuing to defend Panama's interests. Persecution at the international level  not excluding multilateral agencies of which we are a member  is intended to put an end to national efforts to achieve economic recovery and meet the basic needs of the Panamanian people.As a result  Panama today has become living evidence that the Government of the United States means to impose upon Latin America and the Caribbean a new model of colonization by establishing dependent and weak governments  coerced by economic crisis and financial terrorism. Such governments would in many cases be established through manipulating the people with disinformation campaigns  economic blackmail and political interference so that  in the final analysis  they would become States whose sovereign powers could only be exercised depending on the need to preserve United States interests.What my country is enduring is only an early manifestation of a strategy for continental domination whose purpose is to deform our historical ideals of independence and annihilate our aspirations to true democratisation.United States aggression has net with an intense patriotic mobilization of our people  unequivocally reaffirming our nationalism. Faced with the failure of its purposes  the Government of the United States has reverted to other  equally ignoble  means. In another flagrant violation of the Panama Canal Treaties  it has sent fresh personnel contingents and additional military equipment to its military installations located in our country  and it has multiplied its shows of military force which  in addition to being illegal and unjustified  are dangerously targeted to intimidate  threaten and provoke the Panamanians.Arguing a posterior that these are military ""exercises"" to which they allegedly have a right  alluding to feeble pretexts  or simply without any justification at all  troop contingents  artillery and armoured vehicles  accompanied by combat helicopters  have frequently trespassed into areas under exclusive Panamanian jurisdiction. They have gone so far as to close national roads and highways and militarily to seize the most important water treatment facility that supplies drinking water to a third of the population of the country. In addition  they have mobilized  in privately registered vehicles  troops wearing civilian attire but carrying combat equipment  through densely populated neighbourhoods in our nation's capital.Last August  these acts of intimidation were intensified both in frequency and gravity  while at the same time there was open discussion of an armed attack against Panama in the United States Congress sub-committees  and the Chief of the Southern Command - illegally installed on Panamanian soil - boasted publicly of his willingness to decimate the country by blood and fire  in a matter of hours.Actually  as proof of all this the printed text which I am delivering to the Assembly today does not include the most recent examples of United States belligerent provocations in my country. Last weekend military personnel from the Southern Command arrogantly and threateningly prevented my compatriots from engaging in an act of elementary human solidarity  going to the aid of American soldiers trapped on board a helicopter that had just crashed into the sea after buzzing our coast  sowing panic among hundreds of bathers at a beach under Panamanian jurisdiction. As a result  none of the crew members survived and the Government today has had to control a new attempt at subversion frustrated by the firm resistance of our people and armed forces.Previously  at the height of interventionist strategy in our electoral process - as the United States Administration has now admitted - they delivered to the Panamanian opposition over 310 million  and as if this were not enough  the United States went so far as to condemn the results of our elections in advance  and publicly to air the possibility of sending in its troops to kidnap the Commander-in-Chief of the Panama defence forces  an act of state terrorism repeatedly condemned by General Assembly resolutions.The United States  as an active participant in the Panamanian elections  affected the integrity of the voting to such a degree that the Electoral Tribunal decided to nullify the elections by a resolution which has since been upheld as constitutional by the unanimous vote of the Supreme Court.All those actions are serious violations of international law aid the United Nations Charter and  furthermore  they have been committed with ostentatious arrogance in the presence of dignitaries from the regional organization.Panama hopes that the community of nations will weigh the potential consequences of a heightening of the United States military threat against my country  as this could affect peace and the continuance of international juridical order. If the people and the Government of Panama have not capitulated in these 27 months of siege on the part of the West's foremost Power  we shall not yield now  and this fact heightens the imminent danger to the region. The Panamanian people's patriotic mobilisation has led to the formation of volunteer civilian brigades with a firm willingness to resist at whatever cost in defence of our national sovereignty and self-determination.In order that the nature of the conflict should be perfectly clear  I must denounce that  in cur case  the United States cannot invoke the pretexts that it has generally used to justify its military interventions. In 27 months  there has not been a single incident which could  in the least  affect the efficient functioning of the Panama Canal and  in the whole of the Panamanian territory  there has not been a single death of a United States citizen  civilian or military  attributable to the act or will of a Panamanian citizen. The absurdity of such allegation would be compounded by the fact that for 86 years the people of Panama have lived in close contact with United States personnel. Even under affront and humiliating practices of discrimination and arrogant treatment  not a single act of terrorism against a civilian or military citizen of the United States  nor against its property  has ever been committed by a Panamanian citizen or by a citizen of another nation in Panamanian territory. I can proudly and rightfully state that citizens of the United States are far safer in Panama than they are in their own country  in their own cities  and this statement is supported by our statistical data and theirs.There are few people so free of rancour  so committed to agreements based on sacrifices required by reciprocal concessions  as the Panamanian people. For these reasons  we continue to set an example of peace in the midst of the desolation and violence which has  regrettably  marked the history of the American continent in the last decades.These expressions of our special nature reveal very particular characteristics of the national identity we are in the process of forming but they are also conditioning factors in our process leading to a genuinely Panamanian democracy. If the past few decades are impartially assessed in terms of how human rights are observed in Panama  without making comparisons with governments on this or other continents  the figures show that there is a profound respect for human dignity as the backbone of our liberation movement. Even during the last three years of artificially induced discord in our society  there have been no political murders or disappearances and there have been no torture chambers  while the total number of police arrests and actions is so tiny that it has been exceeded elsewhere by factors of ten or a hundred in a matter of days.Our defence forces in no way represent a traditional army organized as a repressive force; on the contrary  they are a genuine expression of our people. Our military personnel are preparing themselves the better to carry out the requirements of the Panama Canal Treaties  which legally require us to assume increasing responsibilities for protecting and defending the Canal with a view to taking over completely from the United States forces  which are temporarily stationed in Panama solely for these legal purposes. Those who attempt to denigrate or hinder the formation of out national armed force are at the same time concealing their intention to fall back on the argument that we are unprepared as a justification for prolonging military presence. This is the reality behind the political and propaganda rhetoric which is being used against Panama to disguise interventionist and aggressive acts by means of sordid accusations aimed at the social role of the Panamanian defence forces. Panamanians are aware that the only links that the leader of a great Power has with world realities are determined by the many levels of the hierarchy beneath him. we know that it is at those levels in the sinister cores of closed governments that many abuses originate  and we know that we have to penetrate to those levels in order to put an end to the present insistence on continuing with the punishment which is supposed to prevent the continent from being ""infected"" by the nationalist example of resistance set by the Panamanian people.For this reason  I shall avail myself of this solemn occasion to reiterate what I said at my inauguration as Provisional President of the Republic of Panama: notwithstanding military aggression and the constant threat that force will be used against us  we have no intention of heading or promoting any movement against the lives or economic interests of citizens of the United States and we are prepared to re-establish the ties of friendly association without rancour; on the condition however  that no sacrifice of our sovereignty or lessening of our independence is imposed on us.During these past months  the Panamanian Government has on many occasions shown its willingness to pursue dialogue both with Washington and with our internal opposition with a view to achieving honourable and equitable formulas of understanding in order to ensure that the life of the country will return to normal without foreign interference  aggression or threats. Only in this way will it be possible to find a satisfactory solution and continue the democratisation process in a genuinely Panamanian manner. If these efforts have not borne fruit  the primary responsibility must fall on the obstinacy with which the Government of the United States is clinging to a misguided policy that ignores Panamanian reality. In an unmistakable spirit of continental brotherhood and in the awareness of  the limits on authority clearly established by the Charter of the Organization of American States  the Government of Panama heartily welcomed the efforts of the regional Organization to mediate in seeking solutions to the internal aspects of the present conflict between Panama and the United States. We are cooperating very willingly  and without cavilling at making concessions in order to establish valid channels for negotiation aid we are continuing to keep those channels open. At the same time  the Provisional Government of which I am President has initiated the widest possible debate on an economic and social plan to consolidate the recovery which we have begun to achieve and it is also taking steps towards resuming the democratisation process by means of elections to ensurethat the will of the people is freely jessed. However  the free expression of the will of a people is unthinkable while they are enduring economic strangulation and living day after day under the threat of a military attack. What right does anybody have to talk about free elections when at the same time they are sabotaging the democratic develops of an electoral debate by threatening to cut our throats?In this context  I should mention the fact that amongst the intellectuals and politicians  journalists and diplomats  community leaders and envoys from organizations who come to Pan arm from abroad  the most frequent reaction we see when they arrive in Panama is one of surprise at finding a reality which is the reverse of the me shown by the d is in for nation networks. Not only are the basic structures of democratic coexistence still intact  but our institutions have undergone only the inevitable changes brought about by military threat and the most outright and blatant interference by one nation in the internal affairs of another in order to impose an artificial and arbitrary political model.the Provisional Government is not only performing its duties of ensuring contro1 over its territory and acting in its capacity of acquiring and fulfilling its international obligations  it is doing so in a climate of peace and without imposing its authority by force. However  my Government is under no illusions that confronting a permanent conflict between our small nation and a Power such as the Unite States is either convenient or positive. If indeed the numbers of Panamanians - inside my Government and outside it  within the armed forces and out of uniform - willing to defend our country at any price are high enough to safeguard our national identity before the world  we do not have to shirk our commitment to democratisation or waver in our determination to bring it about.The Government of the United States has kept Panama in a state of emergency for 27 months and has threatened the very existence of the Panamanian State. None of our efforts  none of the sacrifices we have made in our commitment to the process of democracy has been recognized or taken into account. On the contrary  not only has the reality in our country been concealed  but persecution has increased. That is why I ask the United Nations to contribute to our efforts by carrying out  through applicable mechanisms  a careful and detailed verification of the path which my Government is following towards our own democracy  and to testify to the actions other Governments are taking to obstruct or strangle those efforts.It is not my intention to dramatize our situation  but only to present the facts. Panama has this alternative: to consolidate its presence in the community of free nations  or to become a protectorate  a new form of colony  albeit disguised in flowery language. We represent somewhat more than the simple longing of a country to develop its own plans for the benefit of its citizens. We are an invaded country whose primary commitment is to break the shackles of coarse interference in its internal affairs  which undermines its independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and threatens the basic rights of its citizens.The aggression which we are enduring is the result in no small measure of Panama's loyalty to the principles of non-alignment and to our commitment to neutrality and friendly relations with all nations of the world. It is also the result  in large part  of our refusal to allow our territory and military resources to serve the purposes of foreign military aggression against a country with which we have fraternal bonds. It is the result of our rejection of any form of foreign occupation; it is the result of our unreserved defence of the right of all nations to choose their forms of government without interference of any kind. The current struggle of the Panamanian people does not make us forget others but  rather  strengthens our satisfaction at the advances taking place in other parts of the world. My country decisively supports all efforts to eradicate apartheid once and for all.We are against racism not only because this is a humanitarian question but also because of our experience as a society where there is not the slightest trace of racial discrimination.In a spirit of honour and duty  my country has sent a delegation of the Panama Defence Forces to join the contingents supervising implementation of the agreements which will guarantee Namibia's independence. We would express the warning that in the elections to be held in Namibia  as well as those to be held in Nicaragua  we must avoid any type of foreign intervention that could interfere with the sovereign expression of the will of the citizens of those countries - as happened recently in the case of Panama.How can anyone speak of free elections when a nation grants financial  organizational  promotional and news-media assistance to one political faction in a foreign country  when in other neighbouring nations information and communication systems are set up to brainwash the citizenry  and when the secret services of a foreign Government establishes infiltration and bribery networks in all the organizational units of the country getting ready to elect a government by popular vote? A genuinely democratic contest cannot be conducted when a foreign Government is resorting to coercion by hunger and extreme deprivation  as well as to the outright buying-off of the leaders of other Governments  and when  in addition to an overwhelming apparatus of psychological warfare  the voting population is subjected to the threat of destruction  terror  grief and ruin.We also hope for the success of the joint plan of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity for the decolonisation of Western Sahara  so that the independence and self-determination of the Sahraoui people can be ensured for ever.We call for negotiated solutions in Kampuchea and in the Middle East. We cannot forget that progress in lessening tensions everywhere is directly related to recognition of the inalienable rights of the people. In that respect  Panama continues to offer its solidarity to the people of Puerto Rico in their struggle for self-determination. We urge all parties to continue supporting the efforts of the Secretary-General to fulfil the aspirations of the Cypriot people to independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  and the Panamanian people embraces the Cypriot people's struggle as its own. Panama also desires the prompt reunification of the Korean peninsula.Central America  understandably  has a special significance for us. We welcome the agreements reached by the Heads of State of the region  and we hope that they will not again be obstructed by the arbitrary and unjustifiable decisions of other countries. We remain convinced that the Malvinas islands are an integral part of Argentina  and we therefore place our hopes in the prompt renewal of ties between Buenos Aires and London  and in a greater response to the requirements of the process of decolonisation prevailing in the world.The advances which we mention today - the lessening of tensions between the super-Powers  the agreements to eliminate intermediate-range missiles  the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan  and the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  which we hope will ultimately lead to a permanent peace treaty - should not be interpreted to mean that all the major problems are on their way to final solution.Many of the peoples of the world continue to endure the harsh conditions and dangers caused by a terrible plagues drug consumption and trafficking  a serious threat to the future of mankind as well as to the stability of institutions and States. We see criminal organizations controlling sums of money which exceed the gross national product of many nations  a handful of criminals amassing so much material power that they can defy legitimately constituted authorities and unleash insurrections that take on the dimensions of internal warfare. We must therefore open our eyes to this radical distortion of the basic concept of human association in national States. This is the moment to identify the real roots and rationally agree on the cure  without demagoguery.On the other hand  third-world countries  particularly the Latin American nations  are weighted down by the burden of their foreign debts and by pressures which increasingly require the sacrifice of national sovereignty and the national heritage  while the needs of their peoples are becoming more urgent and pressing. In these circumstances  new forms of neo-colonial subjugation are beginning to emerge  as if humanity's progress in certain areas must be paid for at the cost of setbacks in others.It is unjust for small and poor countries that are struggling to meet their obligations in the international community  playing the game honestly  still find themselves the victims of those who cheat. My country's situation is a good example. I was the Comptroller-General immediately before assuming the presidency  and I can vouch for the scrupulous manner with which we complied with our obligations until 1987. But solely because of the unjust sanctions imposed by the United States Government  Panama has been unable to meet its commitment since that date. Faced with the choice of not paying our foreign debt and seeing our people starve  we have opted for the former  as befits a Government conscious of its moral and social responsibilities.Once again before this Assembly I request the world community to direct its attention to the case of Panama.If the self-determination of the Panamanian people  their ability to engage in peaceful labour aid their commitment to neutrality and friendship with all peoples and nations were to be fully and effectively realized  that would mean more wealth aid welfare for the people of the United States  greater distinction for its leaders  and greatest splendour for the ideals it professes  than would our subjugation into slavery through the use of military force. The cost of the second option is clear  given our unwavering determination to defend our country.The first path  towards which world direction and history is heading  is the one which will lead to lasting and fruitful yields. By abandoning arrogance and coercion  the United States will have greater assurances of always being able to count on friends in the heart of the Americas  on people who  in moments which require reciprocal concessions of interdependence  will be more willing aid more understanding  than it will by carrying out a terrible aggregate of siege  privation  humiliation and injury.We are a nation with such great potential that citizens of many other countries may find among us plentiful opportunities for fortune and happiness. Changes in world trade  in transportation and in communications systems enhance the increasing importance of Panama's geographical characteristics. My Government is fully aware that the rapid development of the wealth of that great natural resource for the benefit of the Panamanian people is inseparable from equitable aid respectful association with other nations and other peoples.Mr. President  it is now my duty  with which I happily comply  to convey the timeless debt of gratitude which the Panamanian people feel towards Your Excellency for the words with which you referred to the situation in Panama in your inaugural address to this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.Indeed  the current conflict between the United States and Panama is incompatible with peace  but a prompt solution depends on allowing Panamanians to carry out our daily tasks in a secure environment  free of violence.Before this forum  I solemnly reiterate my Government's best willingness to peacefully resolve our differences with the Government of the United States  based on mutual recognition of the legitimate interests of both nations.To establish a climate of good will  the first step should be for the United Stages to comply with the provisions of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977  and appoint the Panamanian Administrator proposed by the us  who is to assume office on 1 January 1990  in less than three months. On our part  what I am about to state will leave no doubts in anyone's mind as to our own good faith.The idea of establishing a multinational force to combat drugs is being debated by several Governments. We believe that this proposal merits deep analysis for we must weigh the difficulties of establishing such a force against the incredibly destructive power amassed by these criminal networks.If formulas could be devised so that a multilateral action of this nature became the subject of an international convention  with adequate mechanisms to safeguard national sovereignty and avoid threats to the independence of any nation  then the Republic of Panama would not only render its enthusiastic support to the initiative  but would go further.Given our long experience in fighting illegal drug traffic  because we are neither a producing nor a consuming country  and because our successes in this area have been recognized by the entire world  the Republic of Panama would be willing to accept the headquarters of such a multinational force in our territory  as another service that the Isthmus' strategic position would offer to the international community.If the United States desires a new relationship with Panama concerning military bases  why does it not state that openly? Let the United States make such an announcement  without disguising it in an attempt to impose it using the formula of force without war.In any case  whether with my Government or any other Government of Panama  decisions must reflect the will of the Panamanian people pursuant to article 310 of our Constitution  which establishes a referendum procedure for the ratification of international agreements of a nature so vital to the Republic. The people themselves must be the contracting party.The Republic of Panama has been made into a giant experimental laboratory by the most powerful nation in the world  one that proclaims itself the leader of human rights.In my country  essential elements for the taking over of governments and territories have been put into practice. They are based on low intensity warfare and include tactics such as psychological warfare  economic aggression through the seizure of goods aid property of poor nations  the indebtedness of countries without great resources for future collection with inflated interest  using a form of blackmail which undermines their sovereignty end dignity.lb this one must add military threat and aggression under terms dictated by the arrogance of superior weapons and provocations targeted against a traditionally peaceful people.This laboratory  which produced the so-called Panama crisis  extends to other nations  intimidating them in order to exert pressure and force them to isolate 2 million Panamanians who have never had  and do not have  a background of hostile attitudes  or racism  or aggressiveness  or plans for offensive expansion  and whose only sin is to raise a banner against neo-colonialism  against apartheid and against any form of imperialism. Two million Panamanians aspire only to be left in peace  to work in peace  to share and enjoy the fruits of our efforts  free and in peace."
"111",5526,"PER",44,1989,"ï»¿It is profoundly symbolic that Africa is presiding over the General Assembly. On one hand  it heralds the imminent culmination of the lengthy process of decolonisation and  on the other  it reaffirms our belief in the successful abolishment of apartheid. In that struggle  the Ambassador of Nigeria  Mr. Joseph Garba  has played a prominent role as Chairman of the Committee concerned.The fact that Latin America preceded Africa in the presidency of the highest international political forum is also of especial significance since the climate of detente  so insistently demanded by the South  began to emerge during its presidency. For the first time in this century and in the era of technological dominance  we have a situation in which the struggle for the attainment of peace and justice within nations makes understanding between the super-Powers possible.The reappraisal oÂ£ multilateralism in an ideologically relaxed international environment will open the way to the consolidation of this new process of detente. Inevitably and inexorably  reality is testing the principles that led to the costly military alliances and the forced division of the world into zones of influence.Formulas of understanding and co-operation  unforeseeable only five years ago  are now emerging. This is the beginning of a global strategic re-alignment  which is replacing the framework that has prevailed during the last four decades.This new scene shows complex and encouraging signs. The new dynamics of co-operation among States incorporates the diverse non-military issues that are currently threatening the peace. Hence we see an increasing interdependence between national  regional and global factors. However  the expected benefits of a progressively open world are neither automatic nor balanced. The developing countries are faced with the dual risk of marginalization and new asymmetries. Therefore  we reaffirm that underdevelopment constitutes one of the main threats to international peace. The steady increase of poverty  the impossibility of reactivating growth  the political impossibility of carrying out programmes of economic structural adjustment  terrorism  and the illegal trafficking in drugs are  among others  negative social factors that point dramatically to our critical position in the new global strategy.The international community must face these problems resolutely in order to ensure peace. The positive effects which the international transformation is having in certain regions cannot serve as an excuse for the marginalization of developing countries. We therefore are faced with the challenge of giving positive meaning to the concept of interdependence in order to take advantage of the capacity of developing countries to participate in the spirit and rhythm of this global transformation  taking into account the direct relationship between political  economic  security and development factors.The fundamental features of Latin America today are its increasing political maturity and the incidence of elements whose interaction threatens our security and growth. In this context  we are trying to assert ourselves in order to ensure our defence and the promotion of the democratic system  the strengthening of the value of multilateralism and collective action. Thus we place emphasis on the possibility of our tackling action  avoiding confrontation  but defining a genuine Latin American solution for Latin American problems  thereby avoiding the trend towards unilateralism.Gradually  Latin America has set in motion various efforts at political co-operation aimed at implementing concrete proposals relating to the security of the hemisphere  the consolidation of democracy  the maintenance of peace  and the problems of international trade and the foreign debt. Another aspect of regional co-ordination efforts is expressed in a dialogue with other States or groups of States. Among these efforts  the Group of Bight represents an imaginative alternative in the new international context  promoting as it does a policy of peace and democracy that demands that there be international understanding and solidarity.May I now emphasize the issue of the defence of democracy. This is a regional priority and a factor of Latin American unity. In our region we speak of the defence of democracy  because it is constantly threatened  despite the fact that our people have overwhelmingly opted for freedom. Our experience demonstrates that the political and social effects of the severe and prolonged crisis  which has stultified development and turned the region into an exporter of capital  constitutes the fundamental threat to democracy. Democracy alone does not guarantee economic growth nor does economic growth automatically lead to democracy. International solidarity and political will are needed in order to assure ourselves of both bread and liberty.In Latin America we continue to observe the peace-making process in Central America with fraternal interest. Peru maintains its willingness to support this peace process within the terms of the philosophy that inspired the creation of the Contadora and Support Groups. Now that an agreement between the Central American countries has been reached at the highest level  nothing should impede compliance with Esquipulas II and Costa del Sol.We consider it highly positive that the United Nations has taken the important step of supervising the electoral process in Nicaragua and of establishing the United Nations Observer Group in Central America - a multilateral presence compatible with national sovereignty. The stalemate over the question of the Malvinas Islands had to be ended. Dialogue is indispensable  and we are glad the parties have resumed this course. The evolution of world affairs has confirmed the validity of international principles that are part of an ever-changing legal reality that is now almostuniversal: the principles of non-intervention  self determination  the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for treaties as the basis for peaceful coexistence.In this new era of international detente  the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan has ended. We hope for national reconciliation that will lead to an independent and non-aligned Afghanistan in the near future.With the implementation of the tripartite agreements between Angola  South Africa and Cuba  southern Africa has entered a new era of peace. It is finally laying the foundations for the historic plan for the independence of Namibia under the supervision of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG)  which was established more than a decade ago.The fall of the last stronghold of colonialism in Africa and the speedy entry of Namibia into the society of free nations heralds the end of the infamous crime of apartheid. Only the Pretoria regime remains. The international community must continue to exert pressure to bring it to end its international rebelliousness.Greater efforts are required to resolve sources of tension that have long been under consideration by the United Nations  such as the Middle East and others. Although no immediate solution is in sight  new and positive developments have emerged: the proclamation of the independent Palestinian State on the basis of resolution 181 (II) of 1947  the renunciation of terrorism by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the acceptance of the existence of Israel by those who had denied it.We call upon the parties finally to agree to the convening of an international conference on the Middle East under United Nations auspices and with its participation. This must lead to peace for all the States of the region within secure and internationally recognized borders  taking into account Israel's right to exist as a State  and restitution of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and independence.We are following with interest the prospects for the situation in Kampuchea arising from regional agreements and the withdrawal of foreign troops carried out in accordance with resolution 43/19.Peace-keeping has had a special evolution. Peru has contributed to  and continues to participate actively in  operations directed to support it. We were therefore gratified to learn that the United Nations peace-keeping forces had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.In summary  there are reasons for cautious optimism in evaluating the international situation. The United Nations has finally broken free of the inertia imposed on it by the cold war and the aftermath of the confrontation between ideological power blocs. At the same time  the international legal order and respect for its principles and institutions are being enhanced. It is a long time since they suffered the arrogant challenges of power politics. None the less  grave non-military threats to security persist  and they constitute the origin of new global problems that we will be able to tackle successfully only through collective action and co-operation within the United Nations.In this context  the implementation of democratic processes to channel the will of the people is the indispensable basis for the decolonisation process and the solution of conflicts. Namibia  Western Sahara and Central America  are clear examples of the use of democratic procedures under the supervision of the United Nations.Historically  democratic values have proven fundamental in the promotion of human rights as well as in the maintenance of the international legal order and the right of peoples freely to determine their own destiny. Democratic processes are a factor of peace. Therefore it is indispensable to apply the essence of democracy to international relations. Unfortunately  the instability and asymmetry of the international economic order undermine this process by denying the majority of the people equitable access to its benefits and participation in the decision-making process on issues of global concern on which their own survival often depends.Earlier I mentioned the direct relationship between democracy and development as fundamental elements of security and its consequences for the future position of the underdeveloped areas in the new strategic world scheme  in Latin America we understand security as a comprehensive concept. In other regions also  common criteria on national  regional and collective security are the answer to the challenges posed by the new nature of traditional unilateralism. In essence this is the goal of all the multilateral strategies being implemented to solve current conflicts.In addition to choosing an option in favour of nuclear disarmament  my country has taken an initiative in the field of conventional armaments on a regional scale. Peru has proposed substantial reductions of armament expenditures  as well as confidence-building measures. We achieved this by notching words with deeds. We suspended important military purchases and also promoted  as we still do  frequent contacts between military authorities as part of our neighbourly relations.The projected convening of the fourth Review Conference of the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Arms  in 1990  will constitute a corner-stone in the sphere of nuclear disarmament. Peru is ready to play a constructive role in its capacity as a developing country and a party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco  which instituted the first nuclear-weapon-free zone  thus making an article of faith of the renunciation of those weapons. We consider it essential that that Treaty be observed universally and definitively.We are deeply concerned by the continuation of dangerous nuclear tests because of the ecological damage they represent. We are gratified that our initiative for their complete and definitive prohibition has prospered.While the multilateral solution of regional conflicts of the post-war period continues  new global threats have emerged  demanding collective and immediate action.At this session  the General Assembly has on its agenda the question of international terrorism. In addition to categorical condemnation of this phenomenon  stronger legal commitments must be made within the framework of the United Nations  drawing a clear line separating States from such activities no matter where or by whom they are perpetrated. We are concerned and disappointed that lack of knowledge of real situations leads democratic societies to apologize for crime and its proselytization on their territory. The agents of terror and violence shamelessly present themselves as victims in the name of human rights they violate daily. In Peru this insane violence has cut short the lives of thousands of people  including international experts and co-operation specialists - the true missionaries in the struggle against poverty in our country.Forty-two years ago  during the first session of the General Assembly  Peru demanded concerted action by the international community to fight drug trafficking. In keeping with that farsightedness  we repeat that demand today. There is no need for us to stress the danger that this scourge represents for mankind. Without exaggeration we can state that the next world war will be one waged against drugs  its destructive effects on health and its corrupting impact on institutions.Our youth  which should guarantee the continuity of our values  is the very first target of this social scourge. The security of our countries and of international society as a whole demands responsibility on the part of all. the struggle for its elimination.We Peruvians do not shirk our responsibilities. We devote a substantial part of our scarce resources to fighting drug trafficking  despite the economic crisis that we are enduring.However  the fight against drug trafficking must be viewed as a process with interdependent phases  starting with the growing of the cocoa leaf crop. From ancient times our peasants have dedicated themselves to this agricultural activity  on a reduced scale and only for legitimate purposes. Today  this activity has acquired an economic significance upon which tens of thousands of peasants depend. If we were to deprive them of it we would be promoting a social problem of hunger and protest which might lead to subversion and the relocation of illegal crops. Therefore  genuine solutions must be found that take into account political and social  as well as environmental  issues.That is why we cannot speak about solutions based upon eradication but  rather  about crop substitution on the basis of international agreements of preferential treatment for commodities and the improvement of our transportation infrastructures in order to facilitate access of such commodities to markets at competitive prices.The growing link between terrorism and illegal drug trafficking  with the latter financing the former in exchange for gangster-like protection  is now a proved practice. This association brings out the worst in both individual criminal activities. The ethics of those who claim to be defenders of a supposedly superior system are abdicated and negate the principles of equality  social justice and liberty are negated  as well as the human rights of the Peruvian people  which are systematically being violated by those who are colluding in this sinister alliance.Control of the trade in the chemical inputs for drug manufacturing  the seizure of property and money derived from drug trafficking  and cooperation against the laundering of the illicit profits from it. together with the urgent implementation of a system for the promotion of prices and access to markets of goods to substitute for illegal drug crops  would and should complement the International Convention against illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and thus become a message of hope for our people.The boldest proposals put forward so far would seem to lead to the solution of the global problem I have outlined - namely  the partial conversion of the debt into resources to be used to fight drug trafficking  the legal seizure of all coca-leaf production  and  finally  the decriminalisation of consumption. These Proposals have not yet been considered in depth  but - and this is important - they go beyond the stage of mutual accusations between producing and consuming countries and introduce a positive dialogue that  despite differences of views  opinions and objectives  agrees on the higher goal* putting an end to this scourge.The decisions to be taken should be agreed by the Heads of State of the countries involved in this process. President Bush  in a speech delivered on 5 September last  extended the invitation. Bolivia  Colombia and Peru  the front-line States  have accepted this invitation and are actively working on co-ordinating the pertinent agenda and programme. Should we  however  limit Participation to the United States on the side of consumers? Should we not extend it to other countries which may potentially create the demand?We know that when drug traffickers find difficulties in obtaining access to the market they promptly find an alternative. That is why it would be a disservice to exclude from this dialogue the Heads of State of other countries that represent alternative potential markets.Global concern about the deterioration of the environment today constitutes one of the priorities of the international community. Peru reaffirms the-sovereign right of States over their natural resources and the rational use of those resources. Nevertheless  we consider it indispensable to stress the need to preserve the right to development as an inherent part of collective well-being. That requires increased international co-operation to guarantee the developing countries access to new environmentally sound technologies.There is a need to establish a new category in international relations  a new field of international political co-operation  in order to neutralize these global scourges from whose effects no State can remain exempt since they constitute a new form of transnational phenomenon in international relations. In this category are terrorism  illegal drug trafficking  the preservation of the environment and the malfunctioning of the economic and social system manifested in hunger  absolute poverty  the external debt problem and the demographic explosion.Despite the new level of dialogue attained by the super-Powers  we continue to be unprepared in the midst of a crisis of solidarity and co-operation within an international society that resembles a body devoid of defence mechanisms or a capacity to respond. Hence  we must have recourse to all the potentials of multilateralism.In contrast to the greater clarity that reigns over political issues  short-sightedness remains in international economic relations  as well as the persistent contradiction of unjust and unequal structures  which makes development a frustrating challenge.Therefore. the international political scene must find its logical counterpart in the gradual correction of the deficiencies in the unfair international economic structure within an interrelated approach that takes into account money  trade and finance. To that end we  the developing countries  have renewed our cogent to act collectively in order to achieve the restructuring of the international economic system. If these strategies are not to become an irony in the light of the expansion of absolute poverty  the failure to meet targets  the reverse flows of financial resources and the unilateral and indiscriminate application of macroeconomic policies  there must be collective and democratic managed of global interdependence.We are increasing aware that we live in an interdependent world  that mankind is one and that it shares and experiences a global reality  without impinging on national identities  our people must act positively and flexibly  building bridges to understanding and conciliation that will bring together all their efforts and energies in the construction of a more humane and just world where only peace  together with social justice  will reign."
"112",5573,"PHL",44,1989,"ï»¿Before you began to occupy that exalted seat  Mr. President  you were already discharging a noble international mandate  having presided for years over the Special Committee against Apartheid. Under your direction  the global counterattack against that insult to the race of man has gained signal victories. And now  there you are  Mr. President  a friend of the Filipinos  who visited us in 1987  a friend of our late martyr  Ninoy Aquino  having worked with him at Harvard. We Filipinos rejoice that it is you who will preside over this body of nations for the next 365 days.And to Mr. Dante Caputo  the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  let me say how much our prediction of success for his presidency last year has been proved correct. His expert hand steered us through the proceedings without conflict  without incident  without delay. We had faith in him as an outstanding human leader  and he justified that faith.Filipinos can take added pride in the fact that Dante Caputo  our successful outgoing President  is a man who  like us  has his roots in the world of Hispanic culture.Last year  I came to this rostrum to bring the Assembly a message from the poor of my country. I said that they are poor not because they come from an indolent race. For  I said  our countrymen now cover the earths 2 million of us in the Americas  half a million in the Middle East  a quarter of a million in Europe  half a million in Asia and the Pacific - seekers all of toil and life  teachers of nations  physicians of men  builders of industry  designers of modules that challenge the stars and settle on the moon  men and women of skill and diligence  like those of Europe who settled America and here built a new world. I said they are poor not because they do not know how to fight for their rights. For they were the first in Asia to shed their blood against Western colonialism and produce their own republic. Ninety years later  they were the first nation in the world to mass by the millions to confront guns with rosaries and bring down a dictator without the shedding of blood. In those four bloodless  spectacular days of February they raised  under Corazon C. Aquino  the new peaceful rallying cry of people power  which even now is resonating  sometimes unsuccessfully  always gloriously  in the streets of nations in transition on more than one continent of this earth.I said they are poor not because they multiply too fast. And they know that in rich nations it is the building of cities and industries  not the extermination of human instincts  that has reduced this multiplication.I said they are poor not because their nation does not grow. For our country does grow. Now that we are free again  although we remain harassed by the extremes of right and left  we have kept to our democratic course and our economy is growing again: last year by 6.8 per cent  last semester by 5.3 per cent.They are poor  I said  because they have inherited an external debt from the dictator - now $30 billion - and in order to service it their country must divert about 20 per cent of its annual budget and send out annually $1.7 billion more than it receives. All these years the countries of the North have insisted that one may not talk of debt relief beyond the boardrooms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Yet international debt forgiveness became a reality just about the time the IMF and the World Bank were born  for both these institutions were conceived by the same bold  victorious  visionary leadership that  remembering the stubborn mistake in 1919 at Versailles  forgave in 1947  in London  70 per cent of the German debt. And so I called last year for the formation of an international debt and development commission in order to recapture that original vision. The Group of 77 responded quickly  and two resolutions were drafted. The first called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to continue using his high offices towards a common understanding on a solution to the international external debt. That resolution was passed by the forty-third session of the General Assembly with only one member voting against  and one abstaining.This year the second resolution  submitted as a draft decision by Tunisia on behalf of the Group of 77 - the one calling for the establishment of the commission on debt and development that I had the privilege of proposing last year - is on the agenda of this Assembly. The draft decision calls upon this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly""To establish  under the aegis of the Secretary-General  an Advisory Commission on Debt and Development composed of eminent persons from the academic  political and financial sectors with knowledge and experience in international finance  trade and development  to develop innovative approaches and evolve specific proposals related to all types of debt in order to solve the debt problem of developing countries in a manner consistent with their sustained growth and development."" (A/C.R/43/L.19) . The draft decision provides that""Debtor and creditor interests shall be represented in the membership of the Commission  which shall take into account the need for appropriate geographical representation and regional balance.! (ibid.) . It commands that ""The Commission shall take into consideration the various existing studies and recommendations on the subject  including the views of the Secretary-General set out in his report entitled 'Towards a durable solution of the debt problem and those expressed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in the Trade and Development Report  1988."" (ibid.). Finally  it gives this Commission a life of three years and commands it to submit annual reports to the General Assembly. A commission of this kind was proposed by the non-aligned summit in Belgrade early this month.The Assembly must adopt this draft decision  for the global attack on debt must be pressed. The Assembly must adopt it because you yourself  Mr. President  have articulated the economic  political and social consequences of the international debt. The Assembly must adopt it  for the time is come when original rigidities are yielding to flexibilities. In 1987 Japan suggested IMF-funded bonds to buy out debtors' loans. At the 1988 Toronto summit France proposed the forgiveness of debts of the poorest of the poor in the sub-Sahara. At the forty-third session of the General Assembly last year  French President Francois Mitterand proposed an IMF-guaranteed conversion of loans into bonds to reduce financial charges of debtor countries and urged creditor countries to finance this scheme. Last year  as we were delivering our opening statements in this Hall  the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States - at the annual IMF-World Bank meeting in Berlin - was standing firm against the use of international aid funds for private-debt reduction.A week later  as I negotiated in Washington a review of the Philippine-United States military bases agreement  the same Secretary of the Treasury began to show flexibility. He agreed to the Philippine position that a portion of United States compensation money could be used for a debt-re duct ion component of the bases compensation package.It was for us - and perhaps for all international debtors - a historic breakthrough  a budding promise of universal relief. Four months later the bud blossomed into a full-fledged plan. On 10 March 1989 United States Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas Brady announced that plan  which allows - nay  encourages - the financing of international debt reduction and debt service by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.Because of the plan  our Philippine negotiators may soon sign with private banks a debt-relief agreement that could be unprecedented. It will be voluntary  for the extent of debt relief is determined by the willingness of commercial banks to agree to substantial discounts on debts repaid. It will be a substantial debt reduction  possibly up to half of the debt to banks which choose to exit from our borrowing programme. And there will be new resources - up to $1 billion from the hard core of institutions that will continue to support us.I spoke to the Assembly last year of our poor. They are still poor  and they are still there  but they may now look hopefully to new horizons. Flexible minds make new horizons possible. It is the flexible and creative mind of Secretary Brady  bending with the international reality  that has given us this new horizon. It is  indeed  thank God  the new age of flexibility. I saw it happening in the Soviet Union  too  last month  when I met with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow  where flexibility is pronounced perestroika and glasnost  and includes the ability to change  to admit past imperfections and to dream of new perfections.Let us aid this new flexibility  let us speed its momentum by providing it with global underpinnings  underpinnings which can emanate only from the peaceful processes of the United Nations and the instruments that awaken its talent to create. One such instrument could be the proposed Advisory Commission on Debt and Development. The Commission will come to life  not as a challenge to the creditor nations  but  indeed  as a tribute to them and as a move of collaboration by debtor nations in that new openness which creditors have begun to display.The Brady plan sees forgiveness as essential to revitalizing adjustment and making us credit-worthy again. The Brady plan can jump-start the stalled engines of development of debtor nations. The Brady plan is a beginning  and it must answer still other questions. Is there no criterion  for instance  with which to judge the application of debt-reduction or relief  except that they should be pursued? Must we wait until all the physical levels of production and productivity potentials are obliterated for the debt to be written off or forgiven?  Are not meaningful reductions possible only when there are new facilities that are not caught up in the inertia of the international bureaucracy or of strongly held philosophies and interests? Otherwise  will the focus ever go beyond sub-Sahara?Should not the Government major actors of the plan be mobilizing their leverage and adjusting their financial regulations? Is it enough to lay out the bare bones  which lose their flavour in the broth of rhetoric?Should not the Commission be advising not only on how to persuade creditors to reduce debt but also on how to help debtors produce in order to pay debt?There is  for instance  the generation of power - power produces goods? goods pay debts. The Commission could stimulate power-generation and raise the power capabilities of debtor countries. It could ask the question*  if rich countries have often been ready to underwrite slum clearances  cannot they launch a programme to underwrite power equipment on concessional terms for the development of a slum-cleared economy that in time will develop the capacity to repay these concessional loans? Let the world take note that the most outstanding success of the United Nations is the United Nations itself.The United Nations cap is full of feathers these days. There is a feather for putting Namibia irreversibly on the road to independence and to becoming the 160th Member of the United Nations. There is another feather for the Secretary-General's mediating a cease-fire and bringing fighting between Iran and Iraq to an end. There is a special feather: the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize for the United Nations peace-keeping forces.There are still other feathers perhaps soon to be pinned on that cap - for United Nations campaigns on drug abuse  on the environment and on terrorism. Can there be United Nations campaigns any more urgent than those against these universally recognized evils - drug abuse  abuse of the environment  terrorism? I submit that there can.There is a conventional theological faith that every human being is born with original sin. There is a new theology  a theology of bondage  not liberation.Today a human being is born not only with original sin but also with original debt. To quantify it  the third world now owes 41.3 trillion to creditors  so every child in that world is indebted up to 41 000 at the moment of birth. At anannual rate of interest of 10 per cent compounded  these human beings at the age of 21 will each owe $7 000  and if they marry at that age  husband and wife will begin their married life with a joint burden of over 314 000. Is not that a challenge worthy of 15 9 Members of the United Nations to take up?Is not this campaign worthy of being launched now  now that the momentum of flexibility has stirred the ranks of the lenders?Is not this the moment for the debtors to extend the hand of collaboration to the creditors  in a Commission  as the draft decision puts it  ""of eminent persons from the academic  political and financial sectors with knowledge and experience in international finance  trade and development  to develop innovative approaches and evolve specific proposals related to all types of debt in order to solve the debt problem of developing countries in a manner consistent with their sustained growth and development""? (A/C.2/43/L.19  para  (a))Let the Commission be the next feather in the United Nations cap. It will be a timely and elegant feather. A world of hungry debtors awaits its pinning in the United Nations cap. "
"113",5633,"PNG",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea  I congratulate Mr. Garba of Nigeria on his unanimous election to the important post of President of the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. We are confident that under his able leadership the challenging work before the Assembly will be carried to its conclusion with efficiency and success. I should also like to register Papua New Guinea's sincere appreciation of the excellent job accomplished by his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina.In addition  let me add my Government's voice to the voices of those who have already spoken in praise of the commendable work being done by the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  and his staff in implementing United Nations programmes. Papua New Guinea continues to regard the United Nations as having a unique role in working for the relaxation of tensions  the resolution of conflicts and the building of a strong framework for international co-operation based on mutual respect and understanding. Papua New Guinea remains committed to playing its part in contributing to achieving this objective.My delegation attends this session with the hope that we shall collectively take advantage of the opportunities before us to hasten the realization of the global environment that the founders of the United Nations envisaged for us and future generations.We have before us this year another complex agenda which  among other things  points to an international community saddled with a great number of problems. Some of these problems date back to before the United Nations was even established. Yet it is the responsibility of the Assembly to work for the resolution of those problems. The uncertainty that they cause is felt by all of us  and for many developing countries  including Papua New Guinea  has a direct impact on our development efforts. But there is still some hope and optimism. Papua New Guinea believes with a good measure of confidence that positive steps have been taken in dealing with the problems which are the subject of this session's attention.My delegation highly commends the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his tireless efforts in upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We note with considerable satisfaction his comprehensive report  which records process being made in resolving regional tensions and conflicts  among them those in Cambodia  Afghanistan  Namibia  apartheid South Africa  Western Sahara and Central America  and the Iran-Iraq conflict. The report also underscores the efforts being made to tackle other pressing issues  including the environment  disarmament  trade  finance  debt servicing and human rights.Our own region  the South Pacific  is relatively free of major conflicts  but is nevertheless an area which is being given increasing attention by other countries and international organizations. The South Pacific is not immune from the effects of international tensions elsewhere and the worrying trends in the world economy.The community of the South Pacific comprises mainly small island States scattered in the vast Pacific Ocean. Our struggle is one of survival  a struggle to develop our people and national economies with the limited financial and technical resources available to us while at the same time keeping our region free of big-Power rivalry and the environment free of nuclear and other activities which could harm  if not destroy  our region's resources  including the most important source of livelihood for most island communities - fish and marine resources.Since our independence in 1975 we have actively pursued the cause of decolonisation in the South Pacific. Most of our region has been decolonised  but there are some island communities whose future is still uncertain.Papua New Guinea welcomes the progress being made by the Government of France in bringing political and administrative reforms to New Caledonia through the Matiqnon and other agreements signed between the French Government and the different political groups in the Territory. But we believe that the pace of change must be hastened and a clear commitment made for bringing the Territory to independence as soon as possible. Papua New Guinea regrets the tragic loss of Mr. Jean-Marie Tjibaou  President of the FLNKS  and his deputy  Mr. Yeiwene  on 4 May 1989. The deaths of the late President Tjibaou  Mr. Yeiwene and others who have championed the cause of independence in the Territory for so long and over the years made extensive representations within and outside the United Nations on behalf of their Territory  and who were among those who signed the Matignon agreements  show that more needs to be done by the Government of France to bring about changes ""which conform with the aspirations of the people of New Caledonia  especially the indigenous Kanaks.Both these leaders were men of great vision  strength and wisdom They made great sacrifices for the indigenous Melanesian people of New Caledonia. We pay tribute to then  and we know that their just struggle will not end.New Caledonia is on the United Nations list of Non-Self Governing Territories  following a decision of the Assembly in December 1986. The Assembly therefore has a continuing responsibility to monitor developments in the Territory closely. The Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  in Belgrade  Yugoslavia  this year ""Strongly urged that the question of New Caledonia be kept under active consideration at the United Nations until the conditions for an internationally acceptable act of self-determination  in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations  have been met"". We also hope that the Administering Authority  in France  will comply fully with all its obligations as provided for in the United Nations Charter  and with General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 1541 (XV).Papua New Guinea has also welcomed recent progress made under the Compact arrangements between the United States and the Micronesian islands. We have moved forward in establishing diplomatic relations with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Marshall Islands. But we also look forward to the resolution of the outstanding issues affecting Palau's political future.In the South Pacific  Papua New Guinea is equally concerned about protection of the environment. On 10 August this year  Papua New Guinea ratified two important treaties which seek to protect our environment - namely  the SouthPacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty and the Convention for the Protection of the Environment and Resources of the South Pacific. Taken as a package together with fisheries and other economic arrangements that are being progressively put in place  they represent important corner-stones for the protection of the environment in the South Pacific region  and for the management and development of its vast marine resources in accordance with the interests of the island communities. My Government intends to work closely with our partners in the South Pacific to fully implement these treaty arrangements  and  like those partners  we shall strongly - and especially oppose  France's continued nuclear-testing programme at Mururoa Atoll and all the other activities that are harmful to the resources and livelihood of our people.Such regional initiatives deserve the full and active support of the United Nations. They form part of the wider international concern about  and the action now being taken to protect  the global environment.The Government of Papua New Guinea applauds the decision of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to ratify two of the three Protocols to the South Pacific nuclear-free-zone Treaty. We strongly urge other nuclear-weapons States  including France  the United Kingdom and the United States  to ratify the Protocols and respect the operations of this Treaty and other environmental arrangements in the South Pacific.In regional fisheries  a successful regional fisheries agreement between the United States and the countries members of the South Pacific Forum   signed in 1987  is already contributing to the development of our fisheries resources. We are prepared to enter into similar arrangements with other major fishing nations  on the basis of fair and equitable returns for island States and principles designed to protect and carefully manage the fisheries resources and our environment. We urge the Government of Jap* to co-operate in unlocking the stalled negotiations on a regional fisheries arrangement with island States.Consistent with the declaration made in July this year by the leaders of the South Pacific Forum  we also call on Japan and other distant-water-fishing nations to cease completely the harmful method of qill-net fishing often referred to as the ""wall of death"" in the South Pacific. We are convinced that such a destructive and indiscriminate fishing practice will  if not halted  increasingly diminish our peoples* opportunities and chances not only of a livelihood but of survival in the future.Fisheries  trade development  transport and communications are among the major economic activities being pursued by island States and regional organizations established within the region  in our efforts to improve the welfare of our people and strengthen our wider connections with the international community. Papua New Guinea strongly supports the work of regional organizations in the South Pacific as well as other international agencies  including United Nations agencies  which collaborate closely with them in bringing development to our region.Papua New Guinea's interest extends beyond the South Pacific region. Our foreign policy seeks to expand and diversify relationships with countries Members of the United Nations. Significant progress is already being made towards this commitment in the Asian region.We highly value our growing links with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN is an impressive regional organization  which continues to promote understanding and co-operation in the South-East Asian region and elsewhere  through  among other things  the taking of constructive regional initiatives on issues such as Cambodia. Papua New Guinea has special observer statue at annual meetings off ASSAM foreign ministers. We are pleased that our relationship with ASEAN has been further strengthened this year through Papua Hew Guinea's accession on ? July 1989 to the Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation in South-East Asia.As I said earlier the agenda for this session is a complex one. A significant number of items quite rightly deal with initiatives to reduce international tensions and to promote the cause of peace and security. Papua New Guinea strongly supports international efforts to reduce tensions and the number of conflicts.We especially commend the leaderships in Moscow and in Washington. They have in recent years worked with a deep sense of commitment towards reducing international tensions  and we welcome their further commitment at this session to eliminate chemical weapons. We commend their efforts on disarmament. But we urge them to go even further. Their efforts in particular contributed to the climate of optimism that became evident at last year's session of the General Assembly  and have contributed to the maintenance of that climate this year. Their efforts and those of others  particularly members of the Security Council  must be supported if there is to be any further meaningful progress in the solution of problems in Cambodia  Afghanistan  the Middle East  the Korean peninsula  Namibia and southern Africa.Papua New Guinea welcomes signals off Vietnamese troop withdrawals from Cambodia and hopes that the commitment this entails will be fulfilled  including free elections supervised by the United Nations  and that the people off Cambodia will reassert their identity and return to democracy  peace and tranquillity  and socio-economic progress.The situation in the Korean peninsula is also of concern to my Government. At independence  Papua New Guinea established formal diplomatic ties with both the Republic of Korea sad the Democratic Republic of Korea. Our links with the Republic of Korea have developed more rapidly. But our commitment is to support initiatives by both Koreas for the peaceful reunification of their people. Papua New Guinea urges the Governments of both Koreas to maintain active dialogue in working for understanding  reconciliation and efforts to achieve the peaceful unification of the Korean people. We note with great interest the proposals contained in fee address of President Roh Tae Wco on 11 September 1989 concerning national unification. The declaration  we believe  sets a constructive has is for discussions which could lead to early reunification. I reiterate again that fee Government of Papua New Guinea supports the admission of both North and South Korea as full Members of fee United Nations. Their admission  we believe  has fee potential to open up additional avenues towards dialogue  co-operation and understanding.Papua New Guinea continues to believe that efforts Made to address the underlying causes of tension and conflict in the Middle East oust continue. My Government commends the parties - including the United Nations - involved in this important process. Papua New Guinea reaffirms its belief that the Palestinians have a right to a homeland just as much as Israel has a right to exist within secured borders. Those two conditions are fundamental to any lasting resolution of the tensions and conflicts in the Middle East. The problem of apartheid and the related colonial situation imposed by the racist regime of South Africa still exist in spite of numerous efforts by this body and other United Nations agencies. Papua New Guinea is of the firm belief that the option of mandatory sanctions against South Africa holds good prospects foe success both in dismantling apartheid and in achieving the independence of Namibia.With regard to global trade and the economic developments that have taken place in the recent past  we note that the industrialized countries have moved towards structural adjustment policies to address the issues of low growth and high inflation through the liberalization of trade  the elimination of industrial and agricultural subsidies and the creation of employment opportunities. We also note that many developing countries have experienced not only slow and stagnant economic growth but debt problems as well. As a result of these continuing economic difficulties many developing countries  including Papua New Guinea  have undertaken stringent economic policies and programmes to maintain sustainable economic growth.While there has been progress in some of those areas  Papua New Guinea  with a developing and agriculturally based economy  is concerned that the effects of protectionist pressure exercised by industrialized economies on some of ourstrategic agricultural export commodities have adversely influenced our national plans and efforts to achieve sustainable economic growth. It is therefore imperative that the efforts of the global community  through the United Nations and its agencies as well as the current Uruguay Round of negotiations  should be strengthened to address such trade practices and distortions in order to ensure balanced  liberalised and fair trade between the countries in the international market.In conclusion  my delegation believes that the most important and pressing issue in the world today is the question of peace and development. Peace is the pre-condition for economic development through the expansion of international co-operation. Only in an international environment of peace and stability can the economic development of all nations be enhanced. Papua New Guinea therefore attaches great importance to international efforts aimed at achieving peace  harmony and development in the world. He also fully support efforts aimed at dealing with the growing problems of trade protectionism  debt servicing and the slowing down of financial transfers to developing countries.Papua New Guinea has taken note of the overwhelming support delegations have given to the need for and effectiveness of the United Nations system. While there can be some criticisms about the Organisation's ability to deal with problems affecting the international community  ray delegation believes that there are positive signs that the United Nations network of agencies has been given a chance to work. A considerable amount of momentum has developed within the United Nations in tackling and seeking solutions to some of the world's problems. We must all take full advantage of these opportunities."
"114",5679,"POL",44,1989,"ï»¿ I should like to convey to Mr. Joseph Garba our sincere congratulations on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at the forty-fourth session. I wish him every success in his important mission.The Polish delegation also addresses its best wishes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Recently it has been our honour to have the Secretary-General as our guest in Poland. We wish to express to him our great appreciation and full support for his indefatigable endeavours to ease international tension and solve regional conflicts.The Assembly meets on the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War. That war began in and against Poland as a result of aggression committed by the Nazi Government of Germany and executed in collusion with the Stalinist Government of the Soviet Union. At the same time those two Governments concluded a series of agreements that provided for the partition of Poland and its liquidation as a State. The agreements also concerned the fate of other countries in the region. All those arrangements went against international morality and conflicted with various treaties and fundamental and peremptory rules of general international law. The agreements were thus null and void from their very inception. Yet they were put into effect by their signatories  and as a result  they have brought about extreme suffering afflicting millions in that part of Europe. I am aware of the fact that the Assembly is not a place for historical reminiscences. However  I have mentioned the war for three reasons. First  we must have a full and definite clarification of what happened immediately before and during the war. That is necessary in order to eliminate the influence some past events still exercise on an essential part of our contemporary internationalrelations - and nay yet have an impact in the future - and on the reaction of public opinion in the respective countries. Secondly  we must make the United Nations more effective in its task of preventing armed conflicts. In that field the record of the Organization is less than perfect. Thirdly  50 years ago frontiers and territorial acquisitions were at stake. Today  much emphasis must be put on the duty of all State not to question the frontiers and on the obligation to treat frontiers as inviolable. Some recent debates on territorial issues did more harm than good.The past year has seen many important and favourable changes on the international scene. The development of East-West relations is to a large extent auspicious - including relations between the United states of America and the Soviet Union. Signs of rapprochement can be observed in new contacts and new areas of co-operation between the States of Eastern and Western Europe. Poland takes and will take an active part in that trend.The extinction or mitigation of some regional conflicts also contributes to the overall improvement of the international situation. This is a development in which the United Nations has recently had a major role. Poland endorses the efforts of the Security Council and the Secretary-General for the peaceful settlement of regional conflicts. Consequently  Poland has dispatched military contingents and observer groups for duty in a number of the United Nations peace-keeping and observer missions.But let us take a broader view. At this particular juncture the Organization has a chance to map out the ways of resolving the key problems which beset mankind. These problems include relieving the burden of the arms race  enhancing living standards  preventing further degradation of the environment  and problems of international law  in particular the protection of human rights.Let me begin with the problem of armaments. In our view  the top priorities are limitation of armaments  progressive elimination of nuclear weapons  and elaboration of an effective system of supervision. The world needs new and far-reaching disarmament agreements in which all States would have their fair share. Such agreements should concern all types of armaments in all areas of the world.We believe that all States  whatever their size and strength  bear responsibility for disarmament. Without detracting from the obvious role of the major Powers  each and every State should seek to initiate and promote disarmament measures  including steps of a unilateral character.Poland has been present in that field for a long time. More than 30 years ago the Polish Government submitted proposals for a nuclear-free zone in Europe. Though they did not materialize  they did introduce the very idea into diplomatic thinking and practice.Poland has been taking an active part in the work of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. We assume that the Conference will shortly produce a balanced draft treaty eliminating  once and forever  chemical weapons. The determination of many States to reach agreement on that important matter has been confirmed  among others by the Paris Conference of States Parties to the Geneva Protocol of 1925.Naturally  Poland focuses its attention on Europe  but does that not only because it is a European country. In Europe  in spite of detente  we still have the largest concentration and  therefore  the heaviest concentration and confrontation of the armed forces of the two Power blocs. Hence  the Polish idea of making their military doctrines more defensive and less confrontational. Hence  also  the emphasis on political means of ensuring security  in contradistinction to measures of a strictly military nature. During the recent meeting of the Political Consultative Committee  the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty reaffirmed their readiness to engage  together with other interested States  in a common search for agreements with a view to eliminating all weapons of mass destruction  radically reducing conventional armed forces  preventing the arms races from spreading to outer space  gradually limiting industrial production for military purposes and significantly cutting back military expenditures.On its part  Poland has been making a specific contribution to the limitation of armaments in Europe. The Polish Government decided to reduce its armed forces by the end of 1990 by some 40 000 soldiers  850 main battle tanks  900 artillery guns and mortars  700 armoured vehicles and 80 combat aircraft. The Government also decided to eliminate a number of other items of military technical equipment.At the same time  the Polish Government is also working to develop a new approach to regional disarmament in Europe. Poland has submitted a plan to decrease armaments and increase confidence in Central Europe. That is the Jaruzelski Plan. Motivated by the same aspiration  we take an active part in the Vienna talks of the 23 and 35 States. It is with satisfaction that we take note of the proposals made in regard to conventional forces in Europe at the summit session of the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). We are determined to do our utmost to make it possible for the first accord to be reached in 1990.I now turn to the economic problems  particularly the problem of living standards. The gap between the rich and the poor is widening. Many countries have entered into economic regression. Incidentally  this is also the case of Poland. In the long run this situation will hurt everybody because it will lead to an eruption of social discontent on an unprecedented scale. The effects of such an upheaval may well cripple the interdependent world economy  for nowadays development has become indivisible. What we need is a new consensus on growth and development capable of bringing about an economic order that would be more efficient and of greater use to all groups of States  particularly those that remain under-privileged. We should reach such a consensus next year  during the special session of the General Assembly. We 3hould then start work on the elaboration and adoption of the International Development Strategy for the 1990s.It is becoming imperative to co-ordinate national economic policies in order to reduce instability and unpredictability and to enhance International economic security.We still face the global debt problem. Its magnitude  its persistence and the massive damage it inflicts on the development process in debtor countries and on the world economy are difficult to grasp. Some would assume that after a period of adjustment the debtor countries would return to financial viability and would grow and develop again. That assumption has not materialized. My country is particularly disturbed by the lack of significant progress in achieving a solution to the debt problem of the middle-income countries. In view of the Polish experience  I must tell members frankly that without debt reduction  national economic policies and austerity measures  no matter how vigorous and stringent  will remain but paper measures.There should be a resumption of capital flows to indebted countries in the framework of an open international trading system. The adjustment effort  which are painful on the social plane  are likely to fail if there is no external support. And there is a pressing need for multilateral schemes. All this would amount to a ""debt-with-growth"" strategy.May I add that the difficulty of some States is aggravated by the transfer of resources from the developing countries to the highly industrialized regions. I shall not deal at length with the economic problems of Poland. We realize that help must come from within  yet we seek reasonable assistance coming from abroad.At the same time I can assure the Assembly that the process of liberalization of our trade regime is well advanced and this year a new customs tariff became effective. Moreover  we intend to modify our present formal status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in order to be put on an equal footing with other countries.Against this background I should like  on behalf of my Government  to express our thanks to all countries that have responded to the recommendations of the Western economic summit and launched a special programme of economic assistance to Poland. Let me observe that this assistance transcends the realm of economic action. It has a broader sense because it helps to overcome the division of Europe.I also feel it necessary to make some remarks on international law and human rights.Apart from drafting treaties the General Assembly has its own methods of influencing the law-declaring or law-making process. I am thinking of the adoption of resolutions laying down rules of conduct for States. Certain branches or divisions of contemporary international law owe their origin to the initiatives undertaken by the Assembly along these lines.The manner  however  in which the Assembly fulfils that role is sometimes open to doubt  and it is not without its flaws. The Organization and its Members have not succeeded in stopping the inflation of resolutions  and this statement also applies to some instruments  which aspire to a role in law-making. More often than not the dividing line between law and non-law is blurred. I think that the use of resolutions for declaring existing law and for suggesting new law should be more selective. There is still much room for improvement regarding procedures in this field more extensive preparatory work  elimination of haste  more insistence on agreed solutions - in contradistinction to those imposed by majorities - and much greater use of legal expertise. In the latter respect the Assembly could take more advantage of the International Law Commission.This observation leads me to say a few words about that organ which has rendered so many services to the cause of international law.The International Law Commission was restructured some time ago  but there are still doubts regarding its composition  methods of work and results. The influence of politics on the elections to the Commission has had some bad consequences. There is some connection between that problem and the value and authority of the Commissionâs drafts. As to the choice of subjects  one may suggest that the Commission should not avoid the great legal issues of our time. The Commission's prudence is proof of its wisdom; yet  more imagination would enhance the process of law-making. The Commission should respond to the global challenges we face. It is only then that the Commission will be able to fulfil its mandate under the Charter.In the important field of the judicial settlement of disputes Poland intends to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice according to Article 36 of its Statute. We think that the obligatory jurisdiction of the Court should be enhanced and supported.Poland attaches major weight to the implementation of human rights. We put forward the idea of  and then initiated the work on  the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We hope that this Convention will be adopted at the present session. We intend to accede to some instruments which are not yet binding on us.In the first place we intend to accept the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We also look forward to the day when it will be possible for us to become a member of the Council of Europe and to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights.I now come to my last point  which is Polish foreign policy seen against the background of our obligations under the Charter and the political changes now taking place in my country.Poland has a geo-strategic location that makes its position militarily significant. This has a bearing on the whole region. Yet  I believe that one can control the consequences of this objective fact  or at least try to do it  so as to base Polish foreign policy firmly on the fundamentals of external sovereignty and internal independence. Poland will do its best to maintain peace  freedom and good-neighbourly co-operation in Europe.In other words  without disregarding the facts  we have a vision of peace and freedom in a region which  in contemporary history  has been too often one of conflict  division and domination. If Poland is free and democratic  then its geopolitical and geostrategic importance could and should be turned into an asset that supports peace and fosters freedom.Until recently the role of the ideological factor in international relations - at any rate among many States - has been considerable. Now that role is greatly reduced and the present Polish Government welcomes this development. We shall strive for the total elimination of ideology from inter-State relations  which does . not mean that we reject international morality. Ideology and morality are different things. Morality and respect for the human person remain our highest values.I am convinced that the present reform movement in Poland is a good sign for the world and  more particularly  for Europe. The new Polish Government  under the imaginative leadership of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki  has no intention whatsoever to destabilize the existing international order and  in particular  one of its components  that is the mutual strategic security involving the two super-Powers. However  spheres of security can never mean spheres of influence. We regard changes such as those now taking place in Poland as an element of the disengagement of the super-Powers from their long-standing confrontation in the heart of Europe.The key issue of Polish political strategy lies in our relations with the Soviet Union. We shall respect existing treaties and we firmly believe in mutual respect for national interests. Yet such respect does not impose any limitations regarding the choice and change of the system of government. The present Polish Government acts in such a way that the promotion of our vital interests is not in conflict with the interests of others.We shall contribute to the recreation of a united Europe  in which Poland should have its place. The most recent step in that direction is our treaty with the European Economic Community. We highly appreciate the friendly and helpful attitude of the Community presided over by France.Politics do not boil down to the mere application of some purported laws of history. Personally  I do not believe in the existence of such laws. Destiny can wait  but the time has now come and Poland must shape its fate. We count on our friends in the United Nations."
"115",5750,"PRT",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly. On behalf of my country and of myself personally  I amPleased to express our confidence in your ability to undertake the important duties with which you have been entrusted. I also extend to the President of the General Assembly at its previous session  Mr. Dante Caputo  our deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he carried out his difficult tasks.Furthermore  I would like to give special recognition to the Secretary-General for his untiring activities on behalf of the objectives of the United Nations. Yesterday  my colleague the Foreign Minister of France spoke on behalf of the European Community and carefully enumerated the principal themes to be debated here and the Community's position on these issues. They are positions which my country naturally shares  without prejudice to any particular considerations which arise from our special ties to other countries and continents - ties that constitute an important part of our national identity and that have contributed positively to the positions taken by the Community before the world.Conscious of its past  Portugal has always involved itself in the great issues that concern not only East-West relations  but those between North and South. All those who  like us  defend the principles of democracy  liberty and human rights must continue to work for an improved climate of solidarity between men and among nations.In this context  I would mention the proposal presented by the Portuguese Prime Minister at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in May 1988  concerning the creation in Lisbon of a centre for global interdependence and solidarity. Covering diverse areas and themes and with a flexible structure  the centre would play an important role in the exchange of ideas and projects? a place for study and meetings  it should promote a mutual awareness and understanding of problems and experiences between peoples of the North and South.Portugal's activity in this sector is not limited to the support of such a centre. Through our participation in the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  to which we were recently elected  we shall dedicate ourselves fully to the activities of that important organ of the United Nations. History has ensured that an exceptional relationship should exist between Portugal and the other Portuguese-speaking countries  which today include 200 million human beings scattered over the four corners of the glebe. Then will Angola be able to progress on the path of national reconstruction  Progress and development. We have folded with the greatest attention and care the quadripartite discussions that took place throughout 1988. The constructive spirit that prevailed then was to be crowned by success with the signing of the already historic agreements reached in Brazzaville and New York. Portugal is mindful of the historical and cultural relations that bind it to the great Angolan nation. For that reason we hope that the spirit of peace will be fruitful.  The process will be long and difficult  calling for great persistence  tolerance  courage and vision  but the Angolan people surely will know how to sacrifice the unnecessary and combine their efforts so as to make reconciliation a reality. For our part  we shall continue to do our utmost to support all the efforts under way. It is pertinent here to salute the mediation efforts of President Mobutu Sese Seko  which will undoubtedly benefit the people of Angola  Africa and the world. Also in Mozambique  efforts are being made to put an end to a situation which has been especially painful for its people and which has taken a heavy human and economic toll  we share the hopes of the Mozambican Government and people that the path to peace and reconstruction will soon be found. It is the people of Mozambique who must decide which path to take. Portugal is following with great interest the efforts undertaken to overcome the differences that separate the Mozambican people as well as the significant contribution made by the churches of that country in the interest of national reconciliation. However  for this solution to become permanent it is essential that all the States in the region  and others that have ties with it  diligently seek all means of useful consensus leading to peace.We understand  on the other hand  that the resolution of tensions in southern Africa depends  to a large extent  on the posture adopted by the Republic of South Africa. We hope that the paths to regional understanding and dialogue will continue to be explored so that the climate of cooperation necessary for progress and development in southern Africa will be created. The fulfilment of that objective is none the less inseparable from the process of change in South African society  which should lead to the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of full democracy on a non-racial basis. The international community demands a change in the situation of polarization that exists between the black majority and the white minority  an end to the emergency measures in place since 1985 and the release of political prisoners  including Nelson Mandela. Portugal advocates dialogue  both on the international level and on the internal level  as the means of resolving the problems of this area. We have expressed unequivocally our feeling that certain political  diplomatic or financial pressures  if combined with a careful and persuasive dialogue  could well produce positive results and lead to the desired transformations.It is in that perspective that my country is following attentively the process which will shortly lead to the independence of Namibia and will participate as an observer in the electoral process. In the interests of reaching a desirable equilibrium and progress in all of southern Africa  we believe it to be fundamentally important that the future State of Namibia be based on stability  tolerance and economic and social progress.We expect all participants in the process to honour their undertakings. On the other hand  the presence of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in the Territory and the efficient and persevering actions of Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar and his two associates will ensure the success of this enterprise. Portugal shares a close relationship with Latin America  deriving from age-long historical and cultural links  particularly those which bind it to the great Portuguese-speaking nation of Brazil.We have expressed our solidarity with the Latin American nations regarding the consolidation of their democratic institutions. These have fortunately become widespread today  despite adverse circumstances which have affected economic development and political stability.I should like to stress the importance of in' -national solidarity in resolving the debt problem  a matter which is essential to the stability of Latin America and the progress of its peoples. We must stop draining resources by providing incentives for investment in Latin America  permitting in this way the recovery of economies debilitated by successive years of austerity and sac. ii  imposed on the population. Only in this way will it be possible to avoid the social and political tensions that could well place democratic institutions at risk. Portugal has supported the deepening dialogue with the Rio Group  not only to discuss the problems of debt and international trade  but also to encourage the process of Latin American integration which  as in the case of Western Europe  would constitute a decisive step in the expansion of markets and strengthening of the continent's position in the international scene.In this process of integration  I cannot fail to hail the efforts that have been made by the Andean Pact nations  particularly in their meeting in Cartagena in May 1989. on the subject of Latin America  may I point out the importance of the San Jose meetings  which have brought together in a common effort aimed at the furtherance of peace and development in Central America  the counties of that region  the Twelve  the Contadora Group and its Support Group.I believe that the meeting of San Pedro Sula and those which preceded it show  through results already achieved  the primacy of dialogue over confrontation. They are the incontestable reflection of the force behind the ties that unite the Europe of the Twelve and Central America.It is fitting here to refer to the positive results achieved at the recent Tela Summit  leading to the abandonment of armed struggle in Central America  and to reconciliation of forces and full respect for human rights. Besides  the cessation of external intervention and arms supplies to the region  financial and technical assistance of the type envisaged in the co-operation agreement between the European Community and the States parties to the Treaty on Central American Economic Integration are necessary.Unfortunately  in Panama a situation persists which does not correspond to the hopes that today exist in Central America regarding the re-establishment of democratic rules and respect for the will of the people. This anomalous situation must end urgently and result in the triumph of law. we are witnessing in Latin America the courageous battle of the Republic of Colombia against the network of drug traffickers. Allow  me to express Portugal's unequivocal solidarity with the authorities of Bogota  which are in the forefront of a battle that concerns us all. The problem of trafficking in and consumption of drugs. which has become a universal scourge  destroying insidiously both developed and developing societies  is a matter which touches the entire international community and must be resolutely and mercilessly fought.An illegal situation  morally and politically untenable  continues to prevailin the Non-Self-Governing Territory of East Timor  in spite of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council calling for observance of the fundamental principles - namely  those concerning the right to self-determination of its people - and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on decolonization. 	In accordance with our consistent policy of seeking  through dialogue and negotiation  to achieve a just  comprehensive and internationally acceptable settlement of this issue. Portugal is diligently co-operating  as it has since the very beginning  with the Nation efforts of the Secretary-General regarding the question of East Timor  It is. therefore  in an open and constructive manner that we have been engaged in the talks which  under his auspices  started last May between Indonesia and Portugal  aimed at reaching an agreement on the terms of reference  modalities and timing allowing a visit to the territory by a Portuguese Parliamentary delegation eventually to take place.Though acknowledging the limited scope of this exercise  we are of the opinion that the resumption of the talks is in Itself a positive fact  and we sincerely hope it will be possible to conclude them successfully. We believe that this will certainly be helpful in creating a good atmosphere for their continuation now on the very political substance of the question. Let me assure members of our continuing readiness to co-operate  in good faith and flexibility  with the Secretary-General in the fulfilment of the mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly.On the other hand  unfortunately  many reports have been reaching us lately  coming from different quarters  institutions  such as Amnesty International  and individuals  and giving account of a new and serious aggravation of human rights abuses in East Timor  through an intensification of military repression and harassment of the civilian population. It is worth noting  in this regard  that the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the Commission on Human Rights has - after failing to do so last year - very recently adopted a resolution on East Timor which  inter alia  regrets that more arrests  torture and summary executions are alleged to have taken place there since the end of 1988. I appeal to the international community not to remain indifferent to this situation and for an end to be put immediately to every form of human rights violations in East Timor.Without peace  however  there will be no sound and lasting conditions for a return to normalcy in the Territory. And peace  as demonstrated by the unexpected and stubborn persistence of the fighting there  will not be possible without a settlement that will fully respect the interests of the people of East Timor  the need for which was rightly referred to in the statement made yesterday by Prance on behalf of the 12 States members of the European Community.May I also call members' attention in this respect to the resolutions recently adopted by the European Parliament and the final communiquÃ© issued by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in November 1988. A very special comment should be made  in this context  regarding the letter addressed by Monsignor Belo  head of the local Catholic Church  to the Secretary-General on 6 February 1989  appealing to him for the East Timorese to be allowed freely to express their will on the political future of the Territory  something they have so far been prevented from doing.Portugal  needless to say  has no neo-colonialist objectives whatsoever concerning East Timor. We invoke our capacity as administering Power solely with the aim of co-operating with the United Nations in bringing about a still incomplete decolonization process  in the light of the basic criteria and rules of the United Nations and in accordance with our own moral  historical and constitutional imperatives.In his address yesterday the Foreign Minister of France referred to other grave regional conflicts that unfortunately still persist. The continuation of the conflict in Afghanistan  the fratricide in Cambodia  the continued tension in the Korean peninsula and the serious events that took place in China last spring cannot leave the international community indifferent. I refer here also to the instability that prevails in the Middle East  and I applaud all efforts under way to bring peace to the region  notably those of President Mubarak. Allow me to stress the determination of my country to contribute in every way possible to the resolution of those problems. Unfortunately  it is not only in situations of armed conflict where violations of the most basic principles of human rights are evident.The calm discussion in this Assembly or in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva of the most egregious violations must be understood as a constructive effort on the part of the international community to correct violations  supporting Governments that indicate their concern in this area  or pointing cut the extreme cases where a flagrant disregard for international obligations exists  international trends in this field are frankly positive  whether with respect to the increasing power of public opinion  or with regard to the co-operation of States with the diverse socio-economic institutions concerned. The progress registered in the course of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a relevant example.It is in this context that my country views with alarm recent moves to undermine the efficiency of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva  under the pretext of assuring a better geographical distribution of membership. Equally negative is the tendency that has recently become evident towards a bloc reaction against criticisms or discussions relating to a State in a specific geographical area or regional group. Such initiatives or reactions surely do not foster greater respect for human rights; all States must be aware of this in acting to support those initiatives.I renew my appeal that this issue  fundamental to the international community  be the subject of reasoned debate aimed at improving the organs that deal with it  thereby securing greater assistance for the individuals under their protection. While recognizing the profound social and cultural differences and the varied circumstances of Member States  I believe that all Governments share a common aspiration to establish conditions conducive to the elimination of the death penalty. Portugal  as the first State to abolish that punishment  in 1867  cannot but support the recent initiative taken by the Federal Republic of Germany vis-Ã -vis the adoption of the Optional Protocol attached to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  aimed at the abolition of the death penalty. We appeal to all states that use this form of punishment but that certainly would prefer that it be discontinued  to enable this Protocol to come into force.Turning now to the international economic situation  I should like to express my support of the statement made by the Presidency of the European Community. In 1992 the Community will complete an ambitious process of economic integration. I must reaffirm that the objective of such integration is the creation not of an isolated entity  but of a more prosperous Europe  and therefore more open to co-operation with other regions.Of remarkable importance  at the end of this decade  has been the progress achieved in the multilateral commercial negotiations of the Uruguay Round  which should lead to the widening of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The integration of new areas should  in our view  be harmonious and disciplined and based on rules that assure fair and equal competition  providing specific safeguards in some sector in - for example  textiles and clothing.It is the task of the responsible officials to contribute usefully towards the consolidation of the world economy's basis in the next century. The political realism that today characterizes international relations  the capacity for dialogue and the opening which has been established between the developed and developing countries will be decisive factors in the setting of realistic goals and the accomplishment of concrete results.With regard to the problems of the environment  I would begin by affirming that their resolution should not be seen as a priority of the industrialized countries alone. Recognizing that the latter today possess the means to resolve some of the questions for which they bear responsibility  we should see the protection of the environment and the resolution of ecological questions as one of the principal concerns of all humanity.Only a global policy undertaken by the entire international community can effectively combat the growing deterioration of the ecology. The disappearance of vast areas of forest - namely the Amazon jungle - today endangers the entire terrestrial ecological equilibrium. Portugal believes there is an urgent need to develop adequate solutions  through the mobilization of international resources in co-operation with the efforts of Brazil  Malaysia and other interested States  to put an end to the disturbing deterioration of the tropical forests. The conference on the environment and development  to be held in 1992  must seek to define effective means to confront a situation which can only be considered dramatic.In this battle  which is of concern to us all  efforts should not be spared to establish sustained models of development that will ensure economic growth without destroying the environment.Taking as a point of departure these two premises - the universal nature of ecological problems and the need to secure economic growth without damaging the environment - this Organization  whether through its agencies  including the specialized agencies  or in plenary meetings  should urgently confront the need to establish coherent policies aimed at the protection of the environment and the resolution of current  problems. This session of the General Assembly is taking place in a climate marked by significant improvements in the international political situation  particularly in East-West relations  opening up new prospects in the important area of arms control and disarmament.Since the signing of the intermediate-range nuclear forces Treaty - a treaty that  for the first time in history  was not merely limited to reducing deadly weapons  but aimed at eliminating a vast number of them - there have been increasing signs that further and more decisive steps in this area nay be imminent. It appears that this progress is being accompanied by a general consciousness of the fact that the true mainstays of peace and international security are equilibrium  stability and mutual confidence  as well as respect for the primacy of law and the rights and freedoms of the individual.In saluting the efforts of the United States and the Soviet Union  efforts which have led to the emergence of a new spirit in East-West relations  I must reiterate our profound conviction that all progress in the area of arms control and disarmament must be accompanied by corresponding events in the fundamental area of political and economic democratization and respect for human rights. The resolution of those problems must be accompanied by an increased awareness that the enormous advances of technology must be directed towards the correction of asymmetries that characterize our world today. In conclusion  it is opportune to mention the significant role that we feel has been played by the United Nations peace-keeping operations in this climate of detente. We can thus consider that these operations today constitute one of the greatest successes of our Organization  at least in global terms. Their efficacy must be enhanced  and for this it will be necessary to review their system of functioning. My country reiterates - and with satisfaction - its confidence in the United Nations as a privileged multilateral forum for the pursuance of the objectives of development and consolidation of security and universal peace which  after all  are its reason for being."
"116",5796,"PRY",44,1989,"ï»¿May I begin my address to the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations by expressing my heartfelt pleasure at being present in this forum  which holds such a deep significance in today's political world. I wish to pay my respects to you  General Joseph A. Garba  President of the General Assembly  representative of the Republic of Nigeria  and to extend my best wishes for the success of the proceedings conducted under your expert and competent leadership. I also wish to convey my most cordial greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  a brilliant representative of the Americas who has done so much to unite the nations of the world and who deserves our admiration and gratitude.On behalf of the people of Paraguay  and for myself  I wish to pay homage and respect to all the peoples so honourably represented here. I also extend our very best wishes to their leaders and express our hope that by following the broad highway of liberty and justice they may bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Since the day in 1945 when the United Nations was founded  Paraguay has striven to remain faithful to the lofty principles of the Charter  and above all to those actions that guarantee the peaceful settlement of disputes  the unfailing advance of social and economic well-being to the benefit of every country in the world  the equal standing of all States under the law  self-determination for all peoples and the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other nations.We are pleased to note that in the past year  and so far this year  it has been possible to bring to an end hostilities in the Persian Gulf  to sponsor the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan and to promote the peace accords involving Angola  South Africa and Cuba.With such happy outcomes to strengthen our faith in the ability and will to bring into being an international community based on reason rather than force  we trust that  as Article 1 of the San Francisco Charter provides  all nations in the world will abide by the decision""To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural  or humanitarian character  and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion."" That is why we view with such deep concern the violence prevalent in various parts of our planet  violence provoked by racial prejudice or by theories leading to harmful and dangerous discrimination. We fervently hope that we can put an end to wars  conflicts and pitiless persecutions which have become permanent afflictions in some parts of the world. There is no time to waste before reason comes into its own and efforts are made to eliminate from our civilization the last vestiges of institutionalised hatred that threaten to nullify Article 1 of the Charter  to which I have referred.In this context we wish to support the efforts to bring about the unity of Korea and we hope for a solution to the long-standing conflict in Namibia. We are saddened by the fact that in America  a continent so closely tied to our emotions and so constantly in our thoughts  we have found it difficult to stop this endless fratricidal fighting that destroys everything  filling the land with ruin and desolation and casting a dark shadow on the history of brother nations. Our thoughts turn in particular to El Salvador. No effort - large or small  simple or genial  temporary or permanent - will be tried in vain if we are to stop the bloodshed in that noble nation and in others where the loudest sound nowadays is the sound of gunfire.Just as grave as conventional war between nations or between fellow citizens is the horror provoked by modern acts of terrorism. Today the scourge of terrorism can arise anywhere to tarnish the traditions of honour of any nation. Terror knows no boundaries  and even at the risk of leaving unmentioned the suffering of other countries I must express our deep sympathy to Spain  Peru and Colombia. We fully appreciate the just and painful sacrifices made by the Governments of those countries to combat by lawful means and with due respect for human rights the inhumane and abominable practices of terrorism and to put an end to them.Our heartfelt solidarity goes to Colombia. Deeply moved  we wish to express our warmest support for the courageous and resolute decision taken by its eminent President  Doctor Virgilio Barco  to proceed in the struggle without quarter that his country is facing at this time when it is fighting for its very survival.Let me make it clear that  just as we condemn the terrorism of the armed bands that are out of control  we also heartily condemn the terror imposed by the State. The tragedy of Tiananmen Square and the executions ordered by people's courts also deserve our most sincere and heartfelt repugnance. We stand unconditionally by Colombia and other nations in condemning with all the strength at our command the infamous trade in narcotics. 1 take this opportunity to declare before this General Assembly that Paraguay supports  and will continue to support  as matters of the utmost priority  all the initiatives and measures that may be necessary within the international community to destroy Without mercy the nefarious traffic in drugs.In my country  which has not escaped this scourge  my Government proceeded to destroy fields where marijuana was being grown just as soon as information on its clandestine production became known  by fumigating from the air  with the help of aircraft supplied by the United States Government. We took immediate steps to eradicate every indication of trade in narcotics. My Government will not permit Paraguayan soil to be used for the transit of drugs and drug dealers and  within the limitations imposed upon us by economics  we will use every possible means to Prevent and eradicate this development.I take this opportunity to request the broadest and most positive cooperation of all Member States to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves. I also wish to declare that we share  with optimism and sympathy  President Bush's firm decision to lead the fight on drugs on a world-wide scale.Before I continue to address other international issues that have come to our attention and which we are bound to discuss  I must refer to my own country  Paraguay  where certain developments that are public knowledge have changed the political channels since 3 February 1989. Those changes have a direct bearing on some of the fundamental principles of the United Nations  principles that are at the heart of the major objectives of the United Nations and perhaps point the way of destiny itself  it is a well-known axiom that the history of a nation seldom follows the demanding postulates of political science because situations arise in unfortunate circumstances that are difficult to correct. In Paraguay we were fully conscious of the need to bring about substantial changes in our internal policies.While it is true that in recent decades economic developments had the effect of easing changes in my country's infrastructure  especially in connection with important public works  it is also true that the prolonged exercise of personal power and the prevalence of special interests arising around the seat of power did noticeable and progressive damage to the political institutions of Paraguay and did much to tarnish the international image of the nation.Any strategy designed to bring about the downfall of the dictatorship that had taken over the Government needed careful thought and planning if it was to achieve the proposed objective at the least possible cost to society. Thus it came about that on 2 and 3 February this year a military operation conducted by the armed forces of the nation under my immediate command removed the oppressive and totalitarian regime and dissolved the Parliament that was part and parcel of the power structure dominant at the time.Immediately  and without exceptional measures of any kind to affect the Political and legal structure then in effect we proceeded to build as fast as we could and with the means available to us a new framework for democracy. That is the path being folded at present by the Republic of Paraguay with the unanimous support of every shade of political opinion and of the armed forces.The first and most important development came about when  in the initial days of my Government  fellow citizens  many of whom had heretofore been compelled to live abroad for political reasons  returned to our country as they wished and without restrictions of any kind. All constraints on press and freedom came to an end. Those that had been closed down recovered on that same day  3 February  their constitutional right to inform Paraguayan public opinion. After the events of 3 February elections were called under the Constitution to elect the President of the Republic and members of the National Congress. The electoral law was amended to allow all political parties to participate in a just democracy. Twelve political parties responded to my Government's call  some of them formed under the new political situation  and no fewer than eight parties ran for the office of President of the Republic and to serve in the Chambers of Senators and Deputies.The general elections were held on 1 May this year. The election campaign was hard fought but every candidate enjoyed full guarantees under which to run for office without constraints of any kind. That election brought to our Paraguayan horizon a new era of democracy allowing all my fellow citizens to join in building a modern Paraguay.In the initial phase of the constitutional term the executive branch together with the National Congress proceeded to repeal all repressive or restrictive laws bearing on the political freedoms of citizens. In this connection the first legislation enacted by my Government served to ratify the San Jose de Costa Rica American Convention on Human Rights  which my country had signed 20 years ago.In the same context of compliance with international agreements  so closely bound to the recovery of Paraguay's image  I have submitted for approval by Congress the Convention against -torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture signed in Cartagena de Indias  Colombia  on 9 December 1985  and the Convention on the Political Rights of Women.Within the framework of its intention to consolidate democracy the national Government intends to call for direct elections for local municipal authorities. Another priority project is to call a national constitutional assembly to amend the present Constitution so that the people of Paraguay in an atmosphere of serene and rational debate may adopt a new Constitution that will guarantee the democratic and republican system and eradicate for all time any attempt to bring back autocracy.A policy of the highest priority adopted by the present Government of Paraguay is to bring about effective and real integration with its neighbouring countries within the Plata Basin and a more ambitious plan to involve not only the southern countries but the entire South American continent. In this connection I have had the honour to meet on several occasions with my illustrious colleagues the Presidents of Argentina  Brazil  Bolivia  Peru and Uruguay. I cherish the hope that I shall be able to establish fraternal relations with other American Presidents so that they may come to understand the true dimensions of the political changes brought about in Paraguay in its frank and irreversible advance towards democracy.Within the framework of this dynamic policy in search of integration based on the treaties signed by the countries in the Plata Basin and the Latin American Integration Association  some encouraging results have already been achieved  even though there is still a long way to go. We are improving upon the terms of our reciprocal trade  we are trying to integrate our industries  we are seeking a better understanding of our mutual interests  and above all we are increasing communications among our territories.The bi-national hydroelectric projects at Itaipu  built jointly with Brazil and already in operation  and the dam at Yacyreta  being built jointly with Argentina  are eloquent examples of this spirit of integration. Furthermore  within the past week  the Presidents of the Plata Basin countries have agreed to build an international waterway on the Paraguay  Parana and Plata rivers so as to direct their powerful waters to facilitate waterborne traffic bearing the produce of the vast areas bordering those rivers towards the Atlantic Ocean.This vital project is now under study by skilled technicians and has attracted  in principle  the support of the Inter-American Development Bank. This waterway will without doubt serve as an instrument of exceptional usefulness for the countries that will benefit from its development. Paraguay and Bolivia will be strengthened substantially from this improved access to the sea. At the same time I cannot fail to point out that Paraguay and Bolivia are landlocked countries. They are the only two such countries in the entire American Continent afflicted by this disadvantage. This condition should be fully acknowledged not only by the community of States in the Americas but also by the rest of the world.In this connection may I recall that the law of the sea is a legal accomplishment that does great credit to the ingenuity and political will of people that may now benefit in so many ways from their sea coasts.Nevertheless  true international solidarity among all nations will achieve its real meaning only if so-called landlocked countries  numbering not more than 20  can share equally in the law of the sea  which has been justly named the common heritage of mankind. The economies of landlocked countries  although they benefit from existing international accords dealing with transport  need the resources of the sea  whose rich treasures cannot remain the exclusive property of those situated along the coastlines  but rather should benefit entire continents bathed by its waters. My country daily experiences the problem of being landlocked and believes that perhaps it is time to reach agreements towards international action in concert with other landlocked countries in Europe  Asia and Africa which  like my own country  aspire to find not only easy access to the sea but also to receive from it the bounty that Providence has placed in its waters.I now wish to refer to the foreign indebtedness of our nations. The weight of the external debt continues to threaten the economic recovery of vast areas where the population is struggling on the very threshold of survival. The economy of the developing countries  in spite of wrenching efforts at internal adjustments which always exact a high social cost  have witnessed dramatic reductions in income levels  where the index of poverty and dashed hopes are increasing  while the international financial community often looks on indifferently.May I take this opportunity to remark before this highest forum on the enormous risk run by the nascent democracies in our hemisphere if they remain unable to solve the social and economic problems faced by the large majority of their populations. The solution to these problems will require the unstinting co-operation of the most highly developed societies on our planet  it would be dangerous and fraught with unpredictable consequences to bring about a backward step in the march towards democracy owing to the indifference or neglect of those who are honour-bound to impose a more just international economic order because of the eminent levels of economic growth they have already achieved.The 1980s has been a troubled decade for Latin America  which now finds itself faced by drastic declines in the level of foreign capital investment that weakens the incipient economic strength of the region and burdens the debtor countries with an additional heavy load when they are faced with the problem of financing its stabilization and subsequent growth out of meagre domestic savings. There has been time enough since the initial structural adjustments took place in a number of debtor countries for us to be able to say that internal sacrifices alone will not Provide a final solution to the economic crisis which still holds many countries in its grasp.While Paraguay is not in an extreme situation  we also face debt problems. In this respect we have recently renegotiated an important sector of our external debt with another Latin American debtor nation  the Federal Republic of Brazil. Our terms of adjustment could well be taken as a demonstration of the fact that solutions can be found if there is political will to cooperate towards that end. We perceive hopeful signs of a renewed dialogue in search of solutions to the Problem of foreign indebtedness. We call upon the international financial community and on the Governments of industrial nations to press on in a joint effort designed to strengthen the structures of production and finance in the developing economies. This joint effort will be of benefit not only to the debtors but also to the creditors who wish  as indeed they should wish  the world to be awash in prosperity rather than poverty. Generalised poverty will not bring legitimate prosperity to anyone. We are largely a farming and cattle-raising country  and the vigour of our economy still awaits the support and driving power of investment. We offer in exchange our bountiful soil  our gentle climate  and the strength of the Paraguayan people. Our nation opens its doors to productive investments by foreign enterprises. They will enjoy the support of a Government that follows clear policies to bring about a social market economy  to provide protection for private property and to secure for them the legitimate benefits they earn. We offer to them an adequate guarantee for their investments within a climate of absolute honesty and administrative probity.I am encouraged to make this announcement in this highest forum in the presence of such qualified personalities. I place my trust in the intelligence and the natural goodness of my fellow Paraguayans  who are anxious to achieve an improved quality of life. United in strength  with a practical approach  we can put together concerted action embracing debtors and creditors  multilateral financial organizations and prosperous nations  in a quest for solutions founded on socially acceptable and politically viable terms and conditions  thereby putting aside the dangers threatening the promising democratic processes of so many countries.The economics of production  especially in a country such as mine  that places its trust in agriculture and cattle-raising  run the grave risk posed by the deterioration of the environment. In this connexion  I wish to place on record the concern of my Government over the preservation of a physical environment as bountiful as that of my country. We call for international co-operation so that the resources and experience may serve to defend the fertile valleys  dense forests and bountiful rivers of Paraguay  so that the many millions who will  in the future  share with us the soil of one of the most beautiful regions of America may find a natural environment that can provide for a way of life which is healthful and un-contaminated. Paraguay finds itself at the very moment when it can seek a balanced combination of industrial progress and clear skies in a land that can be even more generous in its gifts. Paraguay is headed irrevocably towards political democracy and is facing the challenges of social and cultural deprivation that affect youthful majority of its population. Sixty-nine per cent of the people in my country are under the age of thirty. We suffer from a high level of illiteracy; we lack the means for adequate higher education; we are behind in the area of public health and we face increasing unemployment levels. We look with hope  to the interest shown by the United Nations Educational  scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)  and the World Health Organisation co-operating with us to solve the deficiencies of our social make-up. We look forward to further and increasing assistance in the coming years so that before the next century begins my country may leave behind the disturbing condition  we inherited from the political system displaced on 3 February this year.My Government also wishes to voice its concern over the constant erosion in the funding of the United Nations Development Programs assigned to the Latin American region. As the time approaches for consultation on the funding and appropriation of resources for the fifth program cycle for the United Nations Development Programme  1992-1996 we wish to make a clear statement of our position. We feel that the share assigned to our region by the program  must remain at least at the same level as today  so as to reverse the process of constant deterioration in technical assistance. We need such assistance for our development  especially in our countries that are economically weaker. On behalf of my Government may I also express our satisfaction with the flexibility and speed shown by the United Nations Development Program in responding to the high priority requests of my Governs  such as those in the field of land reform and job creation in small enterprises. We are confident that  with international cooperation  we shall move forward in the field of social and economic democracy as an inescapable component of the auspicious political transformation now taking place in Paraguay  with the broadest practical guarantee of freedoms the Government and the people of Paraguay have set about consolidating.An Organization such as ours  which proposes to establish the conditions for permanent peace  must logically include on its agenda every year the subject of disarmament. The topic has been taken up with special emphasis and concern by the so-called great. Powers; but it is none the less true that all of our countries  however modest their resources  must also limit their levels of armaments to the strictest minimum. Either the rule of reason or the balance of terror will ultimately decide the level of armaments  whatever our terms of reference.Fear of a nuclear holocaust has driven the super-Powers to take the path of reason. We who lack the power to destroy our planet must be comforted by the hope that true brotherhood will reign in the world.Most recently Pope John Paul II  on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War  summarized in memorable words the entire issue of disarmament when he said ""war itself is irrational and the principle of the peaceful solution of conflicts is the only alternative worthy of mankind-. Risk is seldom far from human existence  but risk can be controlled by intelligence and judgement. This is my understanding of the greatest challenge facing this increasingly important organization  which we support and will continue to support fervently and loyally in our quest for indestructible solidarity among all human beings.I shall return to ray country with the image of this memorable occasionimprinted in my mind  as I have had the honour of addressing this Assembly and in a few words expressing my Government's views on some of the issues we face in our time  as well as the hope cherished by the Paraguayan people that every dawn will bring  together with the light of the tropical sun  the promise of a more fraternal and happy world. May these hours never be wasted as we embark upon the long road to peace  justice  liberty and the brotherhood of man."
"117",5861,"QAT",44,1989,"ï»¿I take pleasure in congratulating Mr. Garba on his election to preside over the current session of the General Assembly. His election is an expression both of appreciation for his expertise and of recognition of the important role his country  Nigeria  plays in the international community. I am completely confident that he will conduct the business of the session in the best possible manner which will help in dealing with the vitally important international issues on our agenda.I also wish to express our thanks to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Argentina  for the objective manner in which he conducted the business of the previous session.Every year we meet in this international forum to reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations and to review the urgent problems and crises which afflict the world. We exchange views and adopt positions on those problems in order to reach decisions which we consider appropriate in dealing with them. In all our efforts we aim at establishing conditions for an international community that will enjoy stability  justice  security and peace. I should like to express our appreciation of the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar on the work of the Organization during the previous year. We express our full satisfaction at the new orientation that is becoming more end more prevalent in the international community  foremost among which is the desire to strengthen the role and enhance the prestige of the United Nations. We support this orientation  in particular  and will work together with all Member States towards reaffirming and consolidating it. The Secretary-General has indicated in his report that the Organization has  in fact  proven both its authority in assuming the role that it was entrusted with and its ability to contribute in m effective manner to the resolution of a number of problems through active peace efforts as it did in Afghanistan  Iran and Iraq  South-East Asia  Namibia and Cyprus and with respect to other Issues that are of concern to us all. While expressing our appreciation for these efforts  we must underline the fact that progress in discharging our responsibilities in dealing with these - and other - issues depends on our action  that of all of us  as Members of this Organization  on our commitment to peaceful settlements  non-use of force and full cooperation with the efforts undertaken by the United Nations.The question of Palestine is the most important and foremost challenge that continues to confront the international community. Prom the very inception of the United Nations the General Assembly has had the question of Palestine on its agenda and  indeed  the Organization assumes a particularly heavy responsibility for that issue. TWO ongoing developments of unquestionable importance are currently taking place regarding this question  developments which must be taken into consideration in any discussion of the issue. They are the Palestinian peoples' uprising in the occupied territories  on the one hand  and the proclamation of the independent State of Palestine  on the other hand.The intifadah is a liberation movement against Zionist occupation and its plans for the settlement of the territories and its continuing violation of the sanctity of the holy lands in Palestine. The intifadah has forced itself on the attention of the world and has become a daily news for the international media. It has clarified the nature of the conflict in a manner that will ebon to failure any attempts at misinformation and deceit. What we have here is a people defending their dignity and struggling for their right to self-determination and national statehood  and accepting every sacrifice in the process. This is the bright and honourable side of the picture. On the other side of the conflict  we see the ugly face of the Israeli practices of oppression which include the murder of children  women and the elderly  deportation  incarceration and torture. Furthermore  we see the bulldozing or dynamiting of homes  the confiscation of land and property and the establishment of new settler colonies. In the name of my country  I salute the blessed intifadah of the Palestinian people and reaffirm our continued support for it. We call upon all international institutions and organizations to assume their responsibilities and to awaken the consciousness of the world so that an end may be put to attempts by the occupation authorities at genocide by removing the Palestinians from their homeland. Last year we witnessed new proof of the desire of the Palestinians to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to the problem based on international legitimacy. I am referring to the courageous initiative taken by the Palestine National Council. Despite world-wide appreciation of the Palestinian initiative and recognition by Ð· majority of the countries of the world of the State of Palestine  Israel - impelled by its expansionist policy and its racist philosophy - still persists in its obduracy and its rejection of all initiatives of good will. In this  it is encouraged by the political and military support that It still receives from certain quarters and countries.The dialogue between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization is a positive development and a step in the right direction. But dialogue is not an end in itself. What is required is that the dialogue result in a clear and explicit position recognizing the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  foremost of which is its right to self-determination. We believe that an international conference attended by all the parties concerned  including the PLO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  and also including the permanent members of the Security Council  is the most direct way of solving this crucial question in a comprehensive and just manner. We view with profound satisfaction the halt of the war between Iran and Iraq that destructive war which squandered the human and material resources of the two neighbouring countries and hindered development in the region. It also jeopardized the security and peace of the whole world. But our satisfaction will not be complete until full understanding is reached by the parties and a formal end put to the state of war  until clear  solid foundations of a just and durable peace between them are established in such a way as to preclude any recourse to the use of force in the future. We believe that co-operation with the Secretary-General and his endeavours and the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) constitute a guarantee for achievement of the desired peace.With regard to the tragic situation in fraternal Lebanon  we are pleased to take note of the resumption of work by the Arab Tripartite Committee. We commend the noble efforts undertaken by that Committee and the positive results that have thus far been achieved. We call upon the parties to continue to co-operate with the Committee as the only available means to extract Lebanon from the vicious circle of infighting and to bring to that country  embattled for so long  the overdue peace and security which it deserves. We also look to the representatives of all the fraternal Lebanese people  meeting in Taif  with the hope that they will reach an agreement on appropriate foundations for building the Lebanon of the future  foundations that represent civilization and a spirit of giving.My country can only condemn the continued Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and of the Syrian Golan. We salute the heroic resistance of the people against that occupation. We call upon the international community to meet its duties in securing full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of those territories. With regard to Afghanistan  my country has always supported the Afghan people's right to self-determination and to the free choice of its political system  without external interference. We call upon all the parties to implement the Geneva Agreements on the subject and to co-operate with the sincere efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this regard. With respect to the question of Cyprus  ray country believes that a just and durable settlement ensuring the coexistence of the two Cypriot communities can be reached through participation in good faith in the ongoing efforts of the United Nations.My country also salutes the endeavours of the leaders of Central America to deal with the problems confronting that region through negotiations and other peaceful means with a view to achieving stability and enabling the peoples of the region to devote their efforts and resources to the development process.The State of Qatar considers the elimination of apartheid in South Africa to be a lofty goal for all mankind. That evil regime is a challenge to the values and sentiments of mankind and Ð³ violation of the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The elimination of that regime is a prime responsibility of our Organization and of the international community. We consider that the limited measures enacted by the authorities in Pretoria in an effort to deal with world public opinion can only mean the perpetuation of that evil regime and impede the final objective Ï namely  the total elimination of apartheid. We welcome the positive developments with regard to independence for Namibia and we hope that all the obstacles South Africa still raises will be overcome. The United Nations plan for Namibiaâs independence should be permitted to bear fruit so that the Namibian people may enjoy independence and regain its security and stability.The International community is confronted with two major challenges that threaten its very structure and put at great peril the achievements of human civilization. I refer to the dangers posed to the environment  on the one hand  and the spread of drug use  on the other hand. The major industrialized countries and the developing or least developed countries are equally in jeopardy. Co-operation on a global scale is necessary to meet these challenges with all the determination they require. Although the responsibility falls upon us all  the industrialized countries beau: a greater burden in this respect commensurate with their financial and technological resources  which may not be available to the developing countries.In this regard my country supports the holding of the proposed 1992 international conference on environment and development. We hope this conference will provide solutions conducive to the protection of our planet in the interests of future generations. At the same time we call for intensified efforts to deal with the scourge of drugs  which threaten the achievements and the very foundations of our civilization.We wish to express our satisfaction at the improvement in the international political climate and the detente in the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States as illustrated  among other things  by the conclusion of the Treaty on the Elimination of IntermediateÂ· -Range and Shorter-Range Missiles  and the beginning of the destruction of some of them  which constitutes a first step towards total disarmament. We also consider this achievement a first step on the long road towards the global and comprehensive end of the nuclear-arms race and a harbinger of better times to come for the human race in a world where peace and understanding prevail.In this connection we attach particular importance to the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  particularly in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East. We feel great concern over Israel's possession of nuclear arms  especially if we take into account its aggressive characteristics and its dominant trait to embark on hazardous adventures. Our concern is heightened by Israel's refusal to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its refusal to subject its nuclear installations to international inspection  'as well as its co-operation with the racist regime of Pretoria. We also support the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the cessation of all nuclear tests  as well as ensuring the diversion of the enormous resources spent on arms to the social and economic development of the developing countries  with an enhanced role for the United Nations.Political detente cannot be consolidated without economic detente. Unfortunately the economic crisis is still with us  if anything  it is worsening. Ws feel deep concern at the widening economic and technological gap between the developing countries and the industrialized countries. While the economies of the majority of the developing countries are stagnant or in decline  the major concern of the industrialized countries is to achieve growth without inflation. The debt problem still constitutes an impediment to the economic development of many developing countries. It is essential to arrive at a fair global understanding to find a solution to the problem of external indebtedness. We believe in the usefulness of the resumption of the broad North-South dialogue aimed at establishing forms of economic co-operation beneficial to all concerned. We hope the special session of the General Assembly scheduled to take place early next year will provide a useful forum for the resumption of this dialogue. We are confident that that session will provide a strong impetus to international co-operation in the field of economic development. Here  we emphasize the importance of the role of the United Nations as a principal forum for dialogue and negotiations relative to such co-operation.Past experience teaches us that we are able to deal effectively with most of our problems if we put our faith in our international Organization and in each other. The challenges confronting us are great indeed  but through seriousness of purpose and good faith we can meet them. Thus we shall achieve our objective of a world where justice and mutual respect prevail and where mankind enjoys the blessings of freedom  peace and stability."
"118",5907,"ROU",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me particular pleasure to congratulate Mr. Garba on the occasion of his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly and to address to him our best wishes for success in the accomplishment of this high assignment.On the instructions of the President of the Socialist Republic of Romania  Nicolae Ceausescu  I have the honour to present to the Assembly the views and the proposals of Romania on the currant world situation and on lines of action to achieve a radical change in international life and the solution of the problems prevailing in the world. The evolution of world events reveals two diametrically opposed trends. On the one hand  as a result of the common endeavours of peoples everywhere and of the powerful action of public opinion for peace and disarmament - which also includes progressive political quarters in various countries - as well as the action of the United Nations  a number of changes have taken place. A relative balance has emerged between the forces which stand for detente  understanding and co-operation and those who oppose them. Thus during recent years important steps have been taken in the direction of disarmament and to the solution through negotiations of some international conflicts.On the other hand  one could witness the intensification of interference in the internal affairs of other States in some governmental quarters aiming at political destabilization in certain countries and the imposition of terms of co-operation in line with their hegemonic interests. The arms race has been going on  especially in the field of the development and modernization of nuclear arms and of other arms of mass destruction. The doctrine of ""nuclear deterrence"" continues to be pursued by some States  which in practical terms means pursuance of the threat of force in international life. The militarization of outer space has already started.The international situation is gravely affected by the world economic crisis which in recent years has further widened the gap between rich and poor countries. Hotbeds of tension and conflicts in some parts of the world continue to persist and some of them have grown worse.Against this background the promotion of a new mentality with regard to inter-State relations and of a new approach for the solution of international problems has become an objective necessity. Both should be based on unabated respect for the principles of relations between States  especially the full equality of rights  national independence and sovereignty  non-interference in domestic affairs  non-use or threat of use of force  and mutual advantage.In the light of these principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and other international documents  Romania proposes that the General Assembly should consider and adopt concrete measures concerning the observance by all States of the principles of peaceful coexistence among States with different social and political systems and the elimination of all acts and forms of interference aimed at changing the social and political system of other countries.In our day  when the right of each people freely to choose its own way of social and economic development is internationally recognized  one cannot accept any form of relations of subordination. Neither can one accept any action by governmental circles to differentiate in relations with socialist countries depending on internal changes to be made by them which would respond to the ideological and political interests of western countries.At the same time one should act firmly against the neo-colonial policy of imperialist forces aimed at keeping the developing countries in the state of being suppliers of cheap primary commodities and sources of high profits for international financial capital  lb this end Romania proposes that the current session should consider and adopt concrete measures concerning the elimination in international economic relations of policies making the development of trade and economic co-operation conditional an the adoption of measures to privatise the public sector or impose free-market and other structural changes proper to the capitalist economy*In line with the provisions of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States  the United Nations should call upon all Governments to respect the right of each people to economic and social development according to its own historic and social conditions and its sovereign options in organizing domestic life. This is reflected in the independent policy of each State.At the same time  in view of the provisions of the United Nations Charter whereby states undertook to develop their regions in a spirit of friendship and mutual respect  Romania believes that the United Nations should endeavour to involve the mass media in a broad cooperative effort in this area. To that end one should oppose any manifestation of a biased  misleading presentation of the conditions in various countries. This world forum should consider and adopt concrete measures concerning the: ""responsibility of States  governmental and non-governmental organizations as well as of mass media in promoting relations of friendship and cooperation  rapprochement and mutual respect among governments and peoples. To that end the coverage of real life in each country  of efforts made by their peoples for economic and social development shall be correct and fair"". The events that took place 50 years ago are there to prove that the duplicity of the great Powers  their policies of appeasement and premises with fascism and Nazism  the lack of unity of peoples and of anti-fascist and anti-war forces have cleared the way for the outbreak of a gigantic world conflagration.""today  mindful of the lessons drawn from history  one cannot but be deeply worried by the obvious rise in the activities of some right-wing and neo-fascistorganizations  and by racist  nationalistic-chauvinist propaganda for the revision of borders. That is why it is imperative for all social and political forces to mobilize themselves in order to ensure peace and security  prevent and people any act of aggression or revanchist and neo-nazi manifestations.In view of the fact that the fundamental challenge of our time is the cessation of the arras race and resolute action towards disarmament  especially nuclear disarmament  as well as the strengthening of the role of the United Nations in matters pertaining to peace and disarmament  Romania submits for consideration the following proposals and lines of action:The General Assembly should call on all Member States to put an end to the modernization and to the development of nuclear weapons and to renounce the doctrine of nuclear deterrence.All nuclear tests should be halted and an international conference be convened on a possible extension of the 1963 Treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere  in outer space and under water to cover also the discontinuance of underground nuclear tests.The General Assembly should reiterate the appeal addressed to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics end the United States of America to conclude  at the earliest possible date  a treaty on a 50-per-cent reduction of their strategic nuclear armaments. All States participating in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament should commit themselves to negotiate prohibition of the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons along with the negotiations aimed at the total elimination of nuclear armaments. The General Assembly should launch an appeal calling for effective agreements at the Vienna negotiations to ensure  under strict and effective international control  a substantial reduction - by at least 50 per cent by the end of the century - in troops  conventional armaments and military expenditures.The General Assembly should proclaim the 1990-1999 decade as the Third Disarmament Decade. The goals of that Decade should be as follows: reduction and ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons; cessation of nuclear tests; renunciation of the militarization of outer space creation of zones free of nuclear and chemical weapons in various regions of the world; substantial reduction of troops  conventional armaments and military expenditures. In order to improve the international political climate  achieve detente and ensure peace  Romania resolutely stands for the cessation of all conflicts in different parts of the world on the basis of equitable solutions that would take into account the need strictly to observe the legitimate interests of peoples of the region.In line with this principled position  Romania proposes the following:The United Nations should reaffirm the obligation assumed by Member States to renounce the use of force in their relations and unabatedly to respect the right of each people freely to choose its way of development without any interference from outside. The United Nations should ensure that any action aimed at the solution of various conflicts does not lead to the elimination of the progressive achievements of the peoples in the respective regions. The United Nations should support the effective organization at the earliest possible date of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all interested States  including the new State of Palestine and Israel  as well as of the permanent members of the Security Council.The provisions of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) should be fully implemented in order to proclaim the independence of Namibia this year.As to the further involvement of United Nations in the resolution of various conflicts it is necessary  in our view  to resort to United Nations peace-keeping forces only when such operations are absolutely required. Also  the expenses should be limited as much as possible and be borne on a voluntary basis  primarily by the countries involved in the conflict and by developed countries.We reaffirm at this session too our solidarity with  and active support for  the position and initiatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at a peaceful  democratic and independent reunification of Korea.In view of the serious condition of the world economy caused by the imperialist policy of inequality and of exploitation by unfair monetary and financial policies  Romania considers that an essential imperative for ensuring world progress and peace is the urgent solution of the external debt crisis affecting developed countries  the elimination of under development and the establishment of equitable economic relations among States.As a developing country  Romania is fully aware of the consequences of the current state of affairs in the world economy and  especially  of the heavy burden represented by external debt  which is one of the most serious problems facing developing countries.By fully mobilizing its entire material and human potential  Romania has succeeded in liberating herself from this burden as of March 1989. This achievement has a profound significance for securing the economic and political independence of the country. In order to reach this goal our option was to redouble the efforts of investments during the decade. This made it possible to pay off the external debt without hampering at the same time the programmes of economic development or the living standard and the income of the population.Based on our own experience  with direct knowledge of the practices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the World Bank and other major international bank s â the economic and political conditions imposed by them  which have destabilizing effects on developing countries and cause the transfer of wealth from these countries to the main developing countries - we consider that the radical improvement of the international credit and interest system has become a matter of top priority calling for urgent action. To this effect  Romania presents the following proposals.First  a maximum fixed interest rate of four to five per cent should be set up for credits granted by the IMF  the World Bank and other major banks. The amount of existing credits should be recalculated on the basis of a maximum interest rate of two to three per cent.Secondly  when providing new credits  the IMF and the World Bank should renounce so-called colonialist-type programmes of economic adjustment. Especially urgent is the need to put an end to those conditions which are aimed at privatising economic sectors and units. Romania considers that the IMF and the World Bank should channel their credits primarily to the public and co-operative sectors  in order to ensure the economic and social development of the countries concerned  to accelerate their progress and to improve the living conditions of their peoples. At the same time  it should be mentioned that in all countries the public sector provides more secure conditions for the financial institutions themselves.Thirdly  the World Bank and other creditor banks should put an end to their practices by which the provision of new financial credits is conditioned on the taking under control of the production of primary commodities in developing countries. Such practices applied by major international banks ensure high profits for the financial capital while exploiting the wealth of developing countries.And  fourthly  one should set reasonable and equitable prices for the primary commodities supplied by developing countries in order to bridge the gap between commodity prices and the prices paid for imported  manufactured products. This would put an end to the transfer of wealth from developing to developed countries. Only last year  as a result of the system of credit and high interest rates charged by the IMP  the World Bank and other banks  as well as of the existing price system  the transfer of financial resources from developing to developed countries amounted to over $ 32 billion.Romania presents these proposals also in its capacity as a member of the IMF and of the World Bank  since it cannot accept being an accomplice to the neo-colonial policies applied by those financial institutions.The revitalization of international co-operation and economic development  particularly of the developing countries  calls for an appropriate preparation of the special session of the General Assembly to be held in 1990. The special session should provide a framework for negotiations between developed and developing countries with a view to agreeing on global solutions for the problems of underdevelopment  international financial and trade relations  and the external debt of developing countries.In the present international conditions  marked by serious problems generated by the arms race  underdevelopment and the continuation of the policy of force and interference in internal affairs  there is more than ever before a compelling need for the participation of all States  on equal footing  in the search for solutions to those problems. In line with Romania's firm stand in favour of disarmament and peace and of the democratic solution of all the complex issues of our times  the Romanian delegation will resolutely act along with other delegations so that through joint efforts and in an atmosphere of understanding and mutual respect the current session may open up sound perspectives for a better world. As recently emphasized by President Nicolae Ceaucescu  the implementation of radical changes in international relations requires that all peoples and progressive and democratic forces everywhere do their utmost in order to ensure the triumph of reason  the achievement of general disarmament  the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiations and the development of co-operation on equal terms among all nations."
"119",5953,"RUS",44,1989,"ï»¿My task as head of the delegation of the Soviet Union to the General Assembly has been greatly facilitated by two fundamental statements made by Mikhail S. Gorbachev concerning the place and role of the United Nations in building new international relations at this crucial stage of world development for mankind  at time when it is moving out of the cold war into a period of peace in its development and affirming a new political order resting on a comprehensive approach to security.The profound analytical report of Mr. Perez de Cuellar on the work of our Organization over the past year has impressed us with its convincing evidence of the expansion of the role of the United Nations as a global peace-maker. Addressing the Assembly  its new President  the representative of Nigeria  Mr. Garba  also referred to that.The heads of many delegations have put forward some far-reaching and original ideas at this session. Yesterday we listened with close attention to the statement of President George Bush of the United States  which  in our view  contained a number of very important and interesting ideas.As always  during these days of the General Assembly's regular session representatives of the world community have together been recreating a panorama of the past year in the life of mankind. Its overriding idea is that of peace and security  its ideal composition is harmony of universal human values and national interests.In making our own national contribution to this grand agreement each of us  I amsure  wants it to become a part of an organic and unitary whole. Unfortunately  in some places the overall composition is still marred by cracks that impair its integrity. Over the past 12 months we have seen a rather contradictory picture of the state of the world.Of course  the central concept remains the same and the theme  a product of mankind's thought and suffering  as we were appropriately reminded by the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War  has not changed: it is the piloting of our common ark towards a new shore and our common desire to chart its course so as to avoid a storm that might destroy it. Nevertheless  there have been some new developments which have aroused concern. It is not just that the ship of the world has not yet negotiated the dangerous straits; it is encountering new threats that could give it a critical lurch.The twentieth century has released the tremendous energy of nations and peoples  and this has become a major factor in the development of universal civilization. It is capable of and has been working miracles by extricating entire national communities from backwardness and poverty in what is historically an amazingly brief span of time. It is adding to the mosaic of the world more andmore bright and clear-cut elements of progress and prosperity. However  the same national energy  when it takes the form of inflated egotism and self-interest  often makes for aggression and expansion  a grasping for one's own good at the expense of others.Here the problem of the self-defence of nations arises  the problem of their Physical survival  preserving their unique historical and cultural identities. Action provokes counteraction  which assumes some highly ambivalent forms. Centrifugal tendencies are prevailing over centripetal ones  thus upsetting the balance of world relationships  which is so hard to build.This diverts the focus of our attention from traditional international issues to domestic and inter-ethnic conflicts. It has now become quite clear that internal strife in some countries extends the process of their destabilization to vast areas and that regional upheavals convulse the whole world. Lebanon is a case in point. It is often much easier to resolve the external issues in a settlement than to deal with its internal conditions  and this is clearly evident in Afghanistan and Cambodia.Today the notion of ""inside the country"" often has a bearing on that of ""outside"". The trouble  however  is that the isolated fragments of the world which yearn for a better life fail to see beyond the mountain ridges  jungles  dunes and other features of their own national landscapes  the threat to their own existence  that might objectively result from such a fragmented view. Equally  those who want to prosper at the expense of others do not see that their own existence is also threatened.This leads us to the question of the responsibility of the part vis-Ã -vis the whole and of nations vis-Ã -vis mankind. This places on our agenda the problem of harmonizing universal and national interests.Some clarifications and explanations are in order here.The supremacy of universal human values and observance of universal rules of the world community are the imperatives of our time. The objective requirements of the age we live in  its trends  character and circumstances leave mankind no other choice but to reject the traditional polarization. This is the axiom which underlies both the concept and the practical policies of the new thinking. Of course  it cannot resolve the existing contradictions overnight  but as a start it can alleviate them.On the question of the primacy of universal human values  we are also implying the mature readiness of nations to accept this. Where that maturity has not yet been attained  and where the national idea is being juxtaposed with the common interest  domestic conflicts directly complement and impel global destructive processes.Now I should like to stress this: freedom of choice continues to crown the hierarchy of a nation's supreme values. Every nation is free to choose the ways and means of its own development  but to do so in a responsible manner. It must not lock itself in the dark rooms of national selfishness or ignore the interests of other peoples and of the entire community of nations. Freedom does not mean irresponsibility towards others  for in the final analysis that would mean irresponsibility towards oneself.The time has finally come to realize that not all means are good for attaining even the most noble ends.The international community has become aware of the danger of narcotics traffic  of terrorism  it condemns and outlaws both phenomena. We need equally determined action against any kind of violence  whatever the motives or excuses for it. Violence by the State against its own people must be totally excluded. Violence on national  ethnic or religious grounds can no longer be tolerated.To repeat  we advocate freedom of choice. However  we reject its interpretation as the licence to use any means  to commit any violence or to shed blood. Freedom must not be sought at the expense of others. No support or sympathy should be extended to so-called movements that countenance actions""humiliating to other nations or use terrorist  barbaric and inhuman methods in waging their struggle. It is to be deplored that. 50 years after the Second World War. some politicians have begun to forget its lessons. Let us remember that political and ideological differences did not prevent Comments and nations from joining forces to defend universal human values from nazism and fascism. The dividing line in that battle was drawn not by ideology but by the rules of and attitudes towards morality. The Soviet Union  the United States. Great Britain and other countries and peoples found themselves in the same camp and. fighting side by side  saved civilization.Fascism  which started the war is the extreme and ugliest form of nationalism and chauvinism. German nazism marched under the banner of revanchism. Now that the forces of revanchism are again becoming active and are seeking to revise and destroy the post-war realities in Europe  it is our duty to warn those who  wittingly or unwittingly  are encouraging those forces. The revanchist movement is dangerous and inimical to the march of peace  to which President Bush referred here yesterday.While expressing respect for healthy national movements  let me refer to one modern concept of nationhood. it defines a nation as a collective personality  endowed with certain rights  in many respects similar to and even sometimes identical with individual human rights. But there are no rights without responsibilities  either for the individual or for the State.It is the mission of the United Nations to promote among the world's peoples the idea of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common good of mankind  and to encourage nations to behave responsibly. This fundamental position of the Soviet Union is clearly reflected in our bilateral contacts. Relations between the Soviet Union and the United states Provide the best illustration of this. I will permit myself to touch upon the  United States-Soviet dialogue only because I am convinced that its importance far transcends the frontiers of the two States.  In the view of the Soviet leadership  this is not a kind of privilege but a clearly understood responsibility towards the world community. Therefore my account of the results of our talks with President Bush and Secretary of State Baker is my report to you.These talks demonstrated increasing awareness by both sides of the need to co-operate for the benefit of mankind and growing confidence that such co-operation  such interaction  is possible.Agreement to hold a meeting of the top leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States shows that we have moved far ahead in solving a number of major bilateral and international problems. Extraordinary efforts at the highest level will be needed to attain the goal of concluding treaties.I am referring in particular to the preparation of the agreement on 50 per cent reductions in strategic offensive arms. We have proposed to the United States side options for resolving the key issues in that agreed: the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-ballistic Missile Systems  space  and long-range sea-launched cruise missiles. Our partners have accommodated us on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. Positions on other outstanding problems have come closer to each other. In our view  by the time the summit meeting is held next year  in late spring or early summer  we may have passed the last turn on the road towards a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms. This is a real prospect. The protocols to the 1974 and 1976 Treaties on nuclear explosions could also be signed at the summit meeting so that they could enter into force very soon thereafter. We are confident that the summit meeting will give a powerful impetus to the talks on major reductions in the armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe.We welcome the proposal concerning chemical weapons put forward yesterday by President Bush. Generally consistent with the initiatives of the Soviet leadership  it indicates to us that we share the desire to rid mankind of these barbaric weapons. The Soviet Union is ready  together with the United States  to go further and assume mutual obligations prior to the conclusion of a multilateral convention: cease the production of chemical weapons  as we have already done - I am referring here also to binary weapons  on a bilateral basis  radically reduce or completely destroy Soviet and United States chemical weapons  regarding this as a step towards the global destruction of chemical weapons: renounce the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances  institute rigorous verification of the cessation of the production and the elimination of chemical warfare agents. I think there is no need to say how beneficial all this would be for the overall world climate.In addition to the problems of security  the Soviet-United States agenda encompasses issues of humanitarian cooperation  regional topics and joint efforts in the fields of the environment and economic development  reflecting the process that brings together national and universal concerns. We are more aware today than ever before that Soviet-United States relations cannot be built outside the global context  divorced from the problems concern to all mankind.Our discussions in Washington and Wyoming have moved us ahead in our efforts to bridge the continuing gap between the attitudes to one's own good and the attitudes to the common good. Much remains to be done  however  to alleviate the disparities of political objectives  for such disparities endanger all of us.Let us examine the situation  taking nuclear weapons as an example. Why are they dangerous? Not only because of their sheer destructive power. They are unacceptable because they widen the chasm between national and universal interests. The equality of nations and the unity of the world become empty talk when someone's national selfishness is driven by the idea of nuclear supremacy over the world  camouflaged as national security interests.I would say that the world community has as yet no reason for complacency or euphoria. The nuclear threat has only been reduced by the Soviet-United States Treaty eliminating intermediate and shorter-range missiles.We believe that reliance on nuclear weapons does not serve anyone's national interests. It is also an obstacle in the way of more democratic international relations. Only the complete elimination of nuclear capabilities would help to attain real security.The advocates of nuclear deterrence do not believe this will be possible in the foreseeable future. They respond with concepts of so-called minimum nuclear deterrence. In our view  that is a step forward  if only a timid one  a step that can be taken. But first we must define what we mean by minimum nuclear deterrence and what capabilities should be considered sufficient.The Soviet Union proposes that those questions be discussed at a meeting of representatives of the nuclear Powers and the States on whose territories nuclear weapons are placed. Of course  the persistence of the concepts of nuclear deterrence is due not only to the undue emphasis placed on national rights and interests at the expense of obligations  but also to the lack of trust. The problem should not be easily dismissed. What is the way out of these vicious circles? It lies in affirming glasnost and openness and in building a wide-ranging infrastructure of pervasive verification. If we do need to deter each other  let deterrence be transparent and verifiable.To that end  the Soviet Union is proposing that all nuclear Powers conclude multilateral agreements on measures to reduce the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war. Detailed discussions to work out such an agreement could be held in consultations among the permanent members of the Security Council.In the same context  we wish to raise once again the problem of the cessation and prohibition of nuclear tests. This is the question of questions. Why are we still unable to put an end to such tests despite the express will of the overwhelming majority of nations? Because there are those who want to maintain their superiority at any cost.Guided by its obligations to the world community  the Soviet Union has revised its nuclear-testing programme by reducing the number and yield of explosions.Let me point out  however  that the efforts of one State are not sufficient for a comprehensive solution to this problem. We see a number of possibilities here. First of all  the USSR is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all nuclear explosions on any day and at any hour if the United States reciprocates. Secondly  it is time finally to end the procedural impasse at the Conference on Disarmament and start concrete discussions there on the problem of a complete test ban. Thirdly  as one possible way of achieving such a ban  we are now considering the possibility of extending the 1963 Treaty to cover underground nuclear explosions. There is an urgent need for a verifiable cessation of the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes. We have declared that this year we are ceasing the production of enriched uranium  that in 1987 we closed down one reactor producing weapons-grade plutonium  and that we plan to close down in 1989 and 1990 a few more such reactors. By the year 2000 all remaining reactors will have been shut down.In addition  the Soviet Union is proposing that all nuclear Powers should begin preparing to conclude an agreement on the cessation and prohibition of the Production of such material. We believe that in the verification of compliance with the agreement the vast experience of applying International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards could prove useful.It would seem that even the way the Second World War began ought to have made clear that weapons do not guarantee security - the more weapons there are  the greater the danger of aggression. And yet for the 45 post-war years security has been sought in the arms race. It is only today that we are beginning to understand the need for a fundamentally different concept of security in Europe  a security that relies increasingly on political means and  only as insurance  on the necessary minimum of armaments.The Vienna accord heralded a new European situation  opening up broad vistas for humanitarian cooperation and exchanges of people  ideas and information. It holds out the prospect that the European idea will rest itself on a foundation of trust and openness. But the groundwork has to be prepared for that by clearing the continent of excessive quantities of arms. That work has begun.When the negotiators do not consign their responsibilities to the back rooms  when they sincerely want to strike a balance between their interests and those of their partners  progress is always achieved. One example is the Vienna talks between the Warsaw Treaty countries and the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on reducing armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe.In response to our alliance's initiative the NATO countries have made some meaningful proposals  which go a long way towards accommodating the positions of the Warsaw Treaty countries. In parallel talks between the countries participating in the European process to develop a qualitatively new generation of confidence- and security-building measures the Warsaw Treaty member countries have proposed a far-reaching approach calling for a comprehensive set of such measures  and extending them to air force and naval activities.Reverting to the topic of the obligations of individual countries to the community  I feel it my duty to emphasize that reluctance to engage in active talks on reducing naval forces is a sign of neglect of those obligations. Leaving naval forces outside the process of reducing armed forces and armaments would be harmful to universal security. The problem of naval forces could be examined  for example  in special consultations to be attended by all States concerned and  above all  by major naval Powers. They would discuss mutual concerns in this sphere and would exchange views on the mechanism and ultimate objective of future negotiations and on how to move towards them step by step.The dialectic of developments on the European continent urgently requires the starting of talks on tactical nuclear weapons. The situation does not appear to be deadlocked. Mutually acceptable solutions could be sought in an in-depth discussion of this whole range of issues between the USSR  the United States  the United Kingdom  France and the States where those weapons have been placed. If NATO countries agree to start talks on tactical nuclear weapons the USSR will respond with further unilateral cuts in its tactical nuclear missiles in Europe.The problem of missile proliferation is also ripe for multilateral discussions. Nearly 20 countries possess such weapons  and the trend towards further geographical spread is still strong.The approach to this issue could be two-pronged. Barriers could be erected which  first  would preclude the proliferation of combat missiles and associated technology across the globe  and  secondly  would not impinge on the legitimate interest of countries in gaining peaceful access to outer space.No one in the world can yet bid farewell to arms  but we can abandon  once and for all - and we can do it now - the practice of unconstrained and uncontrolled international weapons transfers  lb that end the principles of glasnost and openness should be asserted here as well. The USSR reaffirms its willingness to participate in the establishment of a United Nations register of weapons sales and transfers  including work on parameters.The time has come when the idea of preventing war is finding material expression in relations between the armed forces of a number of countries. A new peace-making instrument is being shaped by the Soviet-United States agreement on preventing dangerous military activities and by a series of agreements with the United States  the United Kingdom  West Germany and France on the prevention of incidents on the high seas. Along the same lines. Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have agreed to start talks short!  on putting an end to their military standoff. The  Soviet union expresses the hope that other states too will engage in this process.A civilised world is an open world. Breaking the seals on many secrets  the soviet union has revealed to the international community detailed data about all reductions in its armed forces and armaments  their strength  the size of its military budget  and so on.We reaffirm here the position of the Soviet Union. Our ultimate goal is to have not a single Soviet soldier outside the country. But  speaking of equal responsibilities  let us roundly condemn the continuing encirclement of our country - and not only our country - by military bases of other states.The soviet union attaches fundamental importance to a transition from individual measures of confidence-building  openness and glasnost in international affairs to a global policy of openness  which would become an integral part of comprehensive security and international peace. The President of the united States  Mr. Bush  has proposed the idea of open skies. We like that idea. In welcoming and supporting the initiative  the Soviet Union calls for the opening up and open space  only then shall  e attain absolute transparency and the necessary level of confidence.While we duly include in the records of foreign policy such accomplishments as the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan  the process of granting independence to Namibia  the termination of hostilities on the Iran-Iraq front  and the constructive dynamics in the dialogue on the problem of Cambodia  we cannot yet say that the positive trends are irreversible.Let us pay a grateful tribute to this Organization for its peace-keeping operations. Let us recognize its unique role  which goes beyond simply localizing conflicts and achieves a qualitatively new level in ensuring stability in the world order. But today's world order is of a far broader category. We have firmly established economic security as one of its pillars.The Soviet Union shares the entirely justified concern about  and it supports  measures to overcome the crisis in the world economy - measures that were proposed at the Belgrade summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. There are a few who continue to dictate to the many the terms of their economic existence. The devotees of diktat should understand that perpetuation of the current situation is fraught with the danger of a catastrophe that would spare no one - and that is no exaggeration.It would seem that the world of the rich has nothing to worry about since its economy is in good shape. It would seem also that the rich are beyond reproach since  ostensibly  their wealth breeds generosity. In 1988 the aggregate amount of the developed nations' assistance to the developing countries amounted to 3US 90 billion - an impressive sum indeed - but in the same year the developed nations received from the developed world $US 50 billion more in debt servicing and interest payments. That was the largest flow of capital in history from the poor to the rich man's pocket.Thus the prosperity of the rich is achieved not without help from the poor. There is more to it  however  than this obvious injustice. Such disparities cannot for ever keep testing the strength of the world economy and world politics.The health of the world economy is also being undermined by the enormous cost of military production  which siphons off vast material and intellectual resources from the civilian sector. Now that there is a prospect of limiting the military-industrial complexes  the problem of conversion has to be addressed. This can be done only by working together and relying on the experience of all States.Before the very eyes of just one generation the sphere of politics has linkedup with environmental conservation to give mankind the science of political ecology. No one can master it alone  enchained in the fetter of narrow national interests.  Political ecology requires urgent planetary decisions at the highest political level and the thorough internationalisation of national efforts through the United Nations  through consolidation of its leading environmental branch  the appropriate agency of this Organization. And  since we are speaking of a major component of international security. I would add that political ecology requires the involvement of the Security Council in solving problems and activating such tools as transparency and strict international monitoring.The United Nations conference on environment and development  to be held in 1992  will undoubtedly be a watershed in establishing universal cooperation and working out a code of civilized ecological behaviour. We call for the holding of this conference at the level of Heads of State or Government.Defining for itself the main principles of the concept of ecological security  the Soviet Union considers disarmament  the economy and ecology as an integral whole. While participating in implementing conservation strategies  the Soviet Union has programmes for speeding up the integration of its economy  on an equal and mutually beneficial basis  into the world economy  the modern international division of labour and international exchanges in science and technology. thatend we should like to participate actively in the work of international economic organizations and to establish contacts with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  being convinced that our co-operation with them  as well as with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations will be useful both for us and for the community as a whole.In the building of new international relations  our foreign policy looks ahead to a positive evolution of today's world and to its stability. That orientation remains unchanged  even in the face of certain changes which affect our immediate interests and the interests of the community to which we have the honour to belong. But we remain faithful to our avowed principles and continue to affirm that nations' choices cannot and must not be overridden by force and that stability cannot be achieved by threatening the use of force or by intervention  blockade or other sanctions.It is no secret that we were not enthusiastic about the Polish Communists' election set-back  nor should it be a secret that we hope they can overcome the crisis. Nevertheless  we see nothing threatening in the fact that a coalition Government has been formed  in accordance with the will of the Polish people  We are in no way prejudiced against that Government. We wish it every success and are ready to co-operate with it most actively.Tolerance is the norm of civilized political behaviour. But if it is mandatory for us in our attitude towards the current Government of Poland  why are others so intolerant as regards  say  Cuba? And if a non-Communist Prime Minister is possible in a Socialist country  why should the appearance of a Communist as head of a Western Government be perceived as heresy? That is something we should not exclude either. The days of traditional demarcation lines are numbered. Only one line remains  to be pursued by all of us together moving to a common goal.It is not the expression of popular will that threatens countries  but  rather  political and ideological intolerance  chauvinism and extremist excesses of imperial or nationalist mentalities. It is only when they engender violence and destabilize the life of countries and peoples that the machinery of legitimate defence must be activated.However different may be our ideas of preferable ways of social development  we also have an overriding understanding of our common responsibility for the future of mankind and the survival of civilisation. We know that only together can we step beck from the brink  because an isolated island of development and prosperity would inevitably sink in the ocean of backwardness and poverty peoples and nations cannot be well when mankind is sick. There is only one way out of those fateful correlations. As we see it  it is for the world community to move consciously towards harmony between universal and national principles. It is difficult to attain  but it is possible because the collapse of the world is unthinkable. It is possible because we  all share a place where individual national efforts unite in a single ""energy field"".The United Nations is that Place  it offers a forum for everybody to talk about his own country and its links with the rest of the world. I should like to take this opportunity to say a few words about my country.We are building a new model of society  a new model of relations between Peoples and nations  a new model of socialism. As a great concept  socialism is by no means a spent force  indeed  it is revealing its humanistic potential in the bitter and often dramatic confrontation with the forces and flaws that are organically alien to it We in our country are not just repainting the facade  but are rebuilding the entire structure  in which the rules of living together must and will be based on the supremacy of law  people's power  openness to the outside world  inter-ethnic harmony and friendship.In every sphere of the common life of our State and our people - the national economy  the political system and the people's intellectual endeavour - rejection of the ossified relics of the past goes hand in hand with the enthusiasm of new construction. Even though  in the words of a poet  we may have a gloomy day or two  we are confident that perestroika  which began as a revolution of hopes  will keep those hopes alive. Our people  our nation  will keep perestroika going  for it embodies the aspirations that they cherish.Today  when some Cassandras hasten to make gloomy predictions  we make our own forecast. We want this historical optimism to be shared by all those who understand that the destiny of the world is inseparable from the future of our Perestroika. So we say to them: our determination to make it irreversible is matched by our belief in victory  a confidence grounded in the democratic institutions  which are ready to assert their genuine and full authority.We are moving along that path guided by  not least  our awareness of the historic nature and magnitude of our goal  which we must attain ourselves  while not rejecting the support of the world community.Believe me  we feel that support not only during the tragic days of natural disasters and national misfortunes. I say to representatives: it has been voiced in your statements at this Assembly  it manifests itself every day in your compatriots' generous gestures  their deeds and actions. So I ask you  the envoys of your Governments and nations  to convey to them our warm gratitude. "
"120",6000,"RWA",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the Rwandese Republic  allow me first to convey our warmest congratulations to Mr. Garba of Nigeria  as well as to the officers of the Bureau  who have been elected to guide the work of this session of the General Assembly. Mr. Garba's unanimous election as President of the General assembly at its forty-fourth session is a tribute both to his outstanding diplomatic qualities and to his country  Nigeria  and all of Africa. Our congratulations go equally to the President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session and his associates for the competence with which they guided the work of that session.should also like to pay a warm tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the skill  determination  maturity  understanding and wisdom he has shown in carrying out his complex tasks  as a result of which our Organization has recorded many successes and enhanced its prestige.The Rwandese Republic is proud to join the great family of the united Nations within the prestigious and solemn framework of the forty-fourth session of the General assembly. The annual sessions of the General Assembly unquestionably provide the best opportunity to celebrate peace and the brotherhood of the nations of the world and to take stock forthrightly and constructively of the world's economic  political and social health.The twin pillars of our work continue to be the safeguarding of international peace and security and the building of permanent relations of friendship and co-operation between nations. Our work is part of the long march of the peoples towards the realization of the highest aspirations of all mankind - the development of international harmony and freedom and progress for all peoples.Rwanda reiterates its solemn commitment to the cause of peace and pays a heartfelt tribute to the United Nations for the great successes it has recorded since its creation  we take this opportunity to express the hope that the bends of fraternity and solidarity between peoples will be made even stronger  in order to put an end to the economic and political crisis that is persisting in the world  particularly in the southern hemisphere  including Africa.Despite efforts at various levels to achieve agreement and integration  despite the internal adjustments that have been made  often at the cost of great sacrifices  and despite the goodwill shown both bilaterally and multilaterally at the international level  the crisis continues  the debt increases and the gulf of recession grows deeper year by year  to the detriment of the world's weakest economies.The Rwandese Republic is convinced that the sombre picture of the world economy will not be improved without the establishment of a true balance  with fairer payments for raw materials and basic commodities. Therefore  there must be a fundamental reform of the mechanisms and structures of international trade  to the benefit of the still underdeveloped peoples of the South  who provide the raw materials for the prosperous industries of the North. The continuing economic stagnation afflicting the least developed countries is rooted in the long-standing injustice in the world market. There has already been much discussion of that unfortunate situation. We are amazed by the silence and unwillingness to act of the majority of wealthy countries as they see our societies inexorably trapped in a vicious circle of poverty and debt.The pernicious  exponential growth of Africa's indebtedness has often been criticized here  and there is a risk of the phenomenon's becoming a tired refrain in diplomatic rhetoric as the years pass. The tragedy has become a sad reality that worsens day by day  aggravated by climatic hazards and other natural disasters  which in several regions of our continent have been particularly severe this year.Rwanda  which has suffered as much as have other African countries  once more appeals to the international community for more effective solidarity and mutual understanding with regard to Africa's external debt. My country takes this solemn opportunity sincerely to praise the various generous initiatives of some friendly countries - such as the Federal Republic of Germany  Canada  France  Belgium and Japan - to lighten the debt burden. Those initiatives range from the forgiveness of interest on the debt to the cancellation of accumulated debts.The Rwandese Republic appeals to all other wealthy countries to join in those initiatives. Above all  we plead for the working out and implementation of a lasting global strategy that will make it possible for all the debtor countries to liquidate once and for all their public debt  both commercial and private. Rwanda reaffirms its total support for the common African position on the subject. We support the appeal for the holding of an ad hoc international conference  and believe that the elimination of the crisis would be a vital step on the road towards improving the international economic environment.He must make the most of the desire to be realistic which has become manifest in recent months at the bilateral level. It must be extended to include all the least developed countries  but we must also implement international strategies and action to bring about the economic recovery of the poor countries  to Which solemn commitments have been made.Rwanda contends that  faced with the persistence of the crisis  we must see that the strategies and plans of action go beyond mere words and become a reality  with on the one hand North-South co-operation and on the other hand vigorous efforts to bring about economic integration based on genuine South-South  regional and sub regional co-operation.The economic situation of Africa and the developing countries in general is  today more worrying than ever before. Here I should like to stress the fears and hopes that we the African countries in the category of the least developed feelfaced with the gloomy prospects for the world economy that recent events have revealed.The Group of 77  which provides both the ideal forum for South-South co-operation and an appropriate framework for negotiations with the developed countries in the context of the North-South dialogue  has just celebrated a quarter of a century of existence. Despite differences of opinion  it has reason for at least partial satisfaction at some achievements  notably the maintenance of relative unity and cohesion and the launching in 1974 of a world-wide appeal for a new economic order  an appeal which  unfortunately  when it came up against reality  did not get beyond the stage of a slogan  but which is now more relevant than ever. I should also mention here the adoption in 1981 of the Caracas Programme of Action on Economic Co-operation among developing Countries  which  despite being buffeted by events  also remains relevant.However  although there is now a keener awareness of the problems  this silver jubilee comes at the end of a wasted decade. Nevertheless  perhaps some good can come out of its we must all learn from the failures of the past  as we approach the last decade of the twentieth century  and make the 1990s a decade of economic recovery. Ail the necessary resources must be mobilized in support of the universal implementation of a more realistic and more efficient international development strategy. We once again call upon the most industrialized countries and the international financial institutions to show goodwill and realism in their policy on the debt and to help free the South permanently from economic stagnation.We ask that suitable  fair measures be taken to support the effort  that our countries are making  which involve considerable sacrifices  and that better integrated and better adapted solutions be devised with the full co-operation of all parties to guarantee mankind a balanced  harmonious future.We strongly urge that all the necessary intellectual and moral resources be mobilized in the search for solutions to the economic crisis of the third world in general and of Africa in particular. Those solutions should take into account all the dimensions of the problem  without forgetting or overlooking the social aspects  for the peoples rather than States must be the main beneficiaries of recovery measures. A stifled third world would undoubtedly be a latent threat to the prosperity of the industrialized societies. The economic situation of Africa and the third world is indeed disastrous. Rwanda refuses  however  to yield to despair; it earnestly appeals to all nations of goodwill in the Assembly to work with renewed determination and vigour in all sectors  in order to overcome poverty and desolation.We appeal for unstinting support from the international institutions  programmes and plans of action already in place and from those vet to be agreed. I refer in particular to the new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade for the period 1991 to 2000  in connection with which the ad hoc preparatory committee is actively pursuing its work. I refer also to the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  scheduled for September 1990 in Paris  and to the April 1990 special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation in particular to the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries. In the area of international co-operation in which the stakes and challenges are enormous  the Rwandese Republic favours negotiations as the best way to promote a just and balanced world economic order.Rwanda firmly supports the appeal made in Caracas at the commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Group of 77  and at the time of the celebration of the bicentenary of the French Revolution by a group of Heads of State from the countries of the third world  for a decisive resumption of the North-South dialogue and for the promotion of international economic co-operation for development. In this connection  we are convinced that there must be major structural changes in the world economy and we believe that all countries  rich and poor  much commit themselves to international co-operation within the framework of interdependence which is inevitable. might makes right has been a feature of international economic relations  but it must no longer be accepted. We believe that the current crisis  regardless of responsibility  must be viewed in a new light and that the continuing transfer of resources from the South to the North must yield to a more balanced system from which any form of exploitation will be excluded.The United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  which was adopted by the General Assembly in June 1986  is rapidly coming to an end and might well have little impact on the economic picture of the continent  which was true also of the United Nations international development strategy for the last three decades.A basic problem of crucial importance is still before us  and the Rwandese Republic fully supports the ad hoc resolution of the 25th Summit Conference of the Heads of State or Governments of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  held in Addis Ababa in July 1989. In that resolution the Heads of State or Governments of the OAU appealed to the international community substantially to increase the resources of the Programme  in particular within the framework of the International Development Association (IDA); to extend the Programme beyond 1990; to create additional facilities for financial assistance to intermediary-income African countries non-beneficiaries of the IDA; and to intensify efforts to mobilize resources of the North in support of the economic and social recovery of Africa.Rwanda is convinced that such recovery requires joint efforts by both the South and the North*  the South  by making the appropriate comprehensive structural reforms and improving the macro-economic management of its growth  while endeavouring to stabilize its balance of payments; and the North  by committing itself to supporting these actions through fostering measures of assistanceby the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  and through specific initiatives ranging from the reduction of interest rates to the cancellation of debts  within the framework of a global strategy.We believe that to be truly helpful the structural adjustment of our economies must also be balanced by readjustments in the North; otherwise it runs the risk of amounting to a sterile process of contraction with disastrous political and social consequences. In our opinion  without it the deterioration of the economic and social conditions in African countries will continue  notwithstanding the efforts made by Governments through policies and programmes to bring about stabilization and structural adjustment.In the spirit of General Assembly resolution 43/27  urging our countries to increase their efforts to produce a viable and practical conceptual framework for an economic programme of structural adjustment  and in keeping with the objectives and strategies based on the Plan of Action and the Final Act of Lagos and on the United Nations programme of Action for Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  the latest Summit Meeting of the OAU has just adopted the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes (AAF SAP) for socio-economic recovery and transformation.Rwanda believes that this is a vital  pragmatic instrument for integration  and we hope that it will make it possible for African countries to continue to adjust their economies while ensuring that this adjustment will bring sustained growth and real development in its train.In this connection  Rwanda supports the appeal of the OAU to the international community and the multilateral financial institutions  as well as the General Assembly  to give greater thought to the AAF SAP and to show greater understanding of the efforts and the realities of structural adjustment in Africa. Together with the efforts that have been made within the framework of North-South co-operation  which is indispensable  the Rwandese Republic believes strongly in the principles and objectives of economic integration as the basis for a self-sustained endogenous development in the context of States and within the sub regional and regional frameworks  in keeping with the spirit of Lagos. Prom this perspective  we fully support the resolution adopted at the latest Summit Conference of the OAU on the Second Industrial Development Decade in Africa and the proclamation of 20 November as African Day of Industrialization.Indeed  the importance of a Second Decade in this area is not justified only because the objectives of the First Decade have not been achieved  but above all because well-conceived industrialization is a major asset in creating structures within the framework of economic growth and in the search for lasting solutions to the economic crisis and indebtedness. Industrial investment is  moreover  a fruitful way for African countries to take their destiny in their own hands by way of playing a better  uninhibited role in the world economy.while in this framework the style of development advocated by the North is new irreversible  it is still true that the indispensable transfer of technologies from the North to the South must take place in conditions which make these technologies accessible and acceptable. Perhaps it would be naive to speak of industrialization without making specific reference to the traditional problems with regard to commodities and the harmful machinery of world trade.Though the international community is pleased with the creation in July 1989 of the Common Fund for basic commodities  the serious concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Fund that have been created by. the inequities in the world economy must not be disregarded.The non-industrial countries that provide raw materials are caught up in inextricable difficulties ranging from insufficient production to lade of access to international markets and deterioration in the prices received for their raw materials. Internally  these countries are not able to be self-sufficient in food for their people. At the same time industrialized countries are perfecting protectionist techniques and creating real regional empires.Thus misunderstanding between the two groups is growing  creating suspicion and giving rise to meagre results in the commercial negotiations that have been taking place within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Language unacceptable to both sides has been used  and completely different goals are being pursued.Rwanda pleads for a better balance for Africa and third world countries and for poor countries to be given an opportunity to export  profitably  food  agricultural products and manufactured and semi-manufactured products. Regrettably  present methods of exchange encounter closed markets  and traditional networks of exploitation that have been particularly harmful to developing countries are continually encountered.On this one-way street  which only increases the dependence and fragility of African economies and third-world economies in general  the African countries are continuing to witness  powerlessly the continuing deterioration of their sources of income that results from the median isms imposed by the great northern industrialized countries  which is the source of the vicious cycle that characterizes the whole process of production and marketing. The most flagrant case is that of the difficulties being encountered in the present negotiations within the framework of the new international agreement on coffee  a product in a particularly perilous state though it is one of the pillars of many of our economies.Rwanda  rather than yielding to pessimism  favours the emergence of a new style of co-operation that is more effective and takes the form of appropriate programmes of action that enable our countries to diversify their production and deal with the deficits we have always experienced  which have been a severe handicap.In the spirit of such interdependent co-operation  from this rostrum Rwanda wishes to express its sincere thanks to all countries and international organizations that have  bilaterally and multi later ally  given us the support we need to promote our development. Rwanda is also very grateful to those countries and organizations for their goodwill and friendship  and we solemnly renew our commitment always to manage our economic assets wisely. In these difficult times we intend to be a reliable  business-like partner on whom the international community can rely as it endeavours to bring about greater well-being for the peoples of the world.In the same spirit Rwanda pays a solemn tribute to all States  peoples and international institutions of good will  governmental or non-governmental  who are voluntarily investing their energies in the economic development and social progress of the poor regions of the world for the greater benefit of mankind as a whole. The misfortunes of the world cannot be summed up solely in terms of economic imbalances between the North and the South. There is a major crisis that will seriously burden the future of mankind and could even endanger life on Earth. It is the crisis arising from the heedless management of the ecological wealth of the world  which has been so disrupted by the industrial development of contemporary civilization.An ecological crisis has already been declared? certain vital parameters show the excesses of our civilization but in terms of the destruction of natural resources and the accumulation of industrial waste. There has been disastrous management of much wealth. In this area Rwanda believes that the international community as a whole is involved and that a movement of international solidarity must come about if we are to mobilize all the resources we need to preserve a healthy  viable environment for human beings.It is regrettable that at a time when there is general dismay following the sounding of the alarm with regard to the ozone layer  certain industrialized countries of the North are unscrupulously taking advantage of the present situation to dump their waste on African soil and poison our world. Once more Africa is a victim of drought and creeping desertification. Paradoxically it is also subject to floods and is struck by plagues of locusts. Sadly  natural disasters have affected many areas of Africa as we try to fight against traditional scourges such as desertification. The Republic of Rwanda appeals to the international community to give increased support to our continent in this regard in an effort to preserve our natural resources and our environment.	jSpecial support of that kind is essential  and could be provided through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and be supplemented by bilateral programmes.The programmes of industrial development  which make massive use of natural resources  should  more than in the past  enjoy an environmental component at both the technical study stage and the stage of implementation so that they can be integrated into resource-use plans.The Republic of Rwanda expresses the hope that in this vital area of the environment the international community will mobilize the necessary intellectual and technical resources to produce solutions that will guarantee the survival of our planet. For our part  under the leadership of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Rwanda  Major-General Juvenal Habyarimana  who has made the preservation of the environment one of his top priorities in the programme of food self-sufficiency  Rwanda has undertaken significant actions in this area. Byway of example I might mention the national programme for struggle against erosion  our reforestation campaign  the national environmental strategy and the environmental plan of action - the last two being in the course of preparation.In addition we have adopted a number of political end administrative measures such as the installation of community and development works - (IK UGANDA). He have a national day of the tree  agricultural competitions and prizes  and annual themes devoted to agricultural production. These various actions are aimed at providing incentives to and mobilizing the Rwandese people  encouraging them to participate in food production and to create a balance between production and population  95 per cent of which lives in rural areas and depends entirely on the income and resources produced by agriculture.With the population growing at the rate of 3.7 per cent  during the last two decades Rwanda has recorded significant achievements  notably the following: the production of potatoes rose from 109 621 tonnes in 1974 to 244 700 tonnes in 1983  21 per cent of the land of the country has been reforested  and 83 per cent has been covered by anti-erosion ditches from 1974 to 1986 the contribution of UNUGANDA community efforts to the national development efforts has been evaluated at 14 845 450 209 Rwanda francs.The people of Rwanda has been able to make such achievements thanks to the tireless efforts and initiatives of President Habyarimana. Yet despite the results achieved with regard to protection of the environment and self-sufficiency in food  Rwanda  like other third-world countries  is facing many challenges that are hampering the improvement of its people's social and economic conditions.Together with the serious economic concerns facing the international community - some of which 1 have just outlined - the entire world is torn politically by bloody tensions and fatal conflicts resulting from anachronistic situations of intolerance  colonialism  oppression  imperialism and racism. Violence reigns wherever those outmoded vices remain  wherever the sovereignty of peoples and the integrity of States are flouted  wherever an individual's dignity and human rights are trampled underfoot.Open violence reigns and even grows in many parts of the world  despite nearly a half century of united Nations peace-making efforts. It reigns in the land of apartheid  where it propagates terror in southern Africa) it reigns in the Arab territories illegally occupied by Israel  in Lebanon and in parts of Latin America. The mission of the United Nations to ensure and promote international peace and security is all the more timely today  since one explosive situation gives way to another  and the sound of guns continues to echo in many parts of the world  destroying the energy necessary for the advancement of peoples and societies.None the less  the Republic of Rwanda pays a resounding tribute to the United Nations and its specialized agencies for their tireless work in support of international understanding and harmony. Thanks to the united Nations and its noble role in promoting peace  the twentieth century is entering its final decade in a world-wide climate of detente  and there are genuine prospects for peace at the international level. It is not excessively optimistic to envisage the resolution of the political and military tensions that have long existed in the wake of the Second World War.This climate of detente is due in large part to the fact that reason seems to have triumphed in relations between the Powers of the East and the West with respect to disarmament  even though much remains to be done before the nuclear threat is totally eliminated. The beneficial effects of that detente on the rest of the world are obvious  and the road we have travelled should be carefully mapped in order to record for ever our achievements and to ensure that we continue to march forward in the search for peace and security. In that connection  the international community has welcomed the progress made in many conflicts where the great Powers had been in more or less direct conflict. In southern Africa the Brazzaville and New York agreements were able to break the deadlock on Namibia and begin a process of reconciliation in Angola.At this very moment - despite set-backs attributable to the South African forces of colonialist aggression  which call for the greatest vigilance on the part of the United Nations and the organization of African Unity (OAU) - the plan for the independence of Namibia is irreversibly under way under United Nations auspices.In that connection  the Conference of Heads of State or Government of the organization of African Unity  which held its twenty-fifth regular session in July 1989  considered the status of the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia. The Conference expressed its regret at the grave incidents of' April 1989 and stressed that they were a predictable consequence of the reduction in personnel of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group. It stated its serious concern at the activities of   South African terrorists operating before our very eyes with the intention of compromising and derailing the November elections. It is incomprehensible that South Africa should openly and with impunity defy international conventions on Namibia as defined by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.Rwanda firmly supports the position of the OAU and calls on the General Assembly to take the decisions that can rectify the situation and guarantee truly democratic elections for our Namibian brothers  so that at the Assembly's forty-fifth session Namibia  under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)  can come to this rostrum as the one hundred sixtieth Member of the united Nations.Regrettably  the international community seems to have grown used to the internal and external demands of the racist Pretoria regime and to the genocidal acts that have long been perpetrated by a handful of criminals against the black majority of that country. That indifference does not conceal the commercial interests of certain countries  for the sake of whose profits millions of people have been sacrificed and democracy hobbled. The Republic of Rwanda appeals to the free world to strengthen pressure of all kinds on the criminal Pretoria regime to make it normalize political and economic life in conformity with the universal principles of democracy and human dignity.Apartheid is the height of institutionalised racism; it is an odious and inhuman political  social and economic regime* it is the utter denial of human dignity. It is a criminal  reactionary and degrading system which is doomed to disappear. In the OAU  in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and from this rostrum we have often condemned unreservedly Pretoria's terrorist  abject policy. The forty-fourth session gives us another opportunity to express our disgust and grave concern at the unspeakable crimes committed by the racist minority in SouthAfrica  and the physical  moral  social and economic harm it has been causing for more than 200 years. We vigorously deplore the notorious indifference of the murderous racist regime's economic  political and military partners with respect to comprehensive mandatory sanctions - those partners who would like to be viewed as the champions of democracy and the defenders of human dignity and human rights. Despite our disappointment  we appeal to the international community to increase its support for the liberation movements in that country  and we strongly support the convening in December next of a special session of the General assembly on apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern Africa.With respect to the situation in Angola  Rwanda firmly supports current peace initiatives. That was why the President of the Republic of Rwanda personally participated in the talks held in Gbadolite in June 1989 on the commendable initiative of President Mobutu of Zaire. Rwanda appeals to all political leaders to support those peace initiatives so that the fraternal country of Angola may see the end of the civil war that has sundered it for more than 15 years and may finally devote its energy to healing its wounds and to achieving social and economic progress.My country also reaffirms its support for the fraternal people of Mozambique  which for many years has been the victim of criminal attacks by REN AM 0  which is supported by the racist Government of South Africa. We renew our support for the Sahraoui people  which continues to be deprived of its right to self-determination and independence*  we welcome efforts by the OAD and the United Nations to formulate suitable modalities for the implementation of the peace plan for western Sahara.Elsewhere in Africa tension and civil war persist  blocking the social and economic development of the peoples concerned. Rwanda deeply believes in the irrefutable virtues of dialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes  and in the principle of the non-use of force  and we vigorously condemn terrorism and aggression  in keeping with international ethics and the spirit of non-alignment. The Republic of Rwanda welcomes the peace initiatives that have been taken in the extremely difficult context of these conflicts. We urge the parties concerned to use direct and fraternal dialogue  which is the only way to promote the dynamic of peace and security between peoples.Rwanda has repeatedly expressed in international forums its support for peace and dialogue. This is a policy which we are seeking to turn into concrete fact at the sub regional  regional and international levels.The state of war which has been tearing the Middle East apart for decades  leading to the martyrdom of the Palestinian people  and the devastation of Lebanon  which not so very long ago was prosperous but today has been ravaged  are distressing situations whose persistence brings shame on all mankind.Having officially recognized the independent State of Palestine  proclaimed in Algiers in December 1988  Rwanda once again expresses its solidarity with the Palestinian people's cause and its dedication to peaceful and direct negotiations between the parties concerned. The only legitimate force  which we believe in  is the force of law and reason  for that is the only one that is compatible with peace and the dignity of men and peoples.Although Rwanda  like other peace-loving countries  heaved a deep sigh of relief following the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq and the beginning of negotiations between the two parties  we are still concerned by the continuation of armed conflict in Afghanistan  after the much-lauded withdrawal of Soviet troops.  The United Nations  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and all the forces of mediation must do their utmost to put an end to this source of tension and fratricidal hatred. But if that is to be done  the belligerents must show good-will and reasonableness and must agree to sit down at the negotiating table.In connection with the situation in Cambodia  we express our complete support for the process of mediation currently under way. We hope that the negotiations being conducted within the framework of the Paris Conference and at the level of the United Nations will continue and will lead very soon to balanced and lasting solutions.On the same lines  we hope that the problems that are afflicting some countries in Latin America and making it an unstable region will soon be resolved. It is high time that all the forces there opted for peaceful negotiations and democracy  and that the forces of interference recognized that the States concerned have a legitimate  inalienable right to national sovereignty. In this context  Rwanda supports ail the peace initiatives and efforts at reconciliation in Latin America  particularly within the framework of the Contadora Group.Mankind's recent history has left certain peoples with open wounds  and now the international community must devote itself to healing them. We of course have in mind past conflicts  from the ruins of which certain countries must work to rise and the spectre of which must be exorcised. But we have in mind also - and specifically - the continuing tragedy of the divisions that are tearing fraternal peoples apart. Iron curtains and other walls of hatred  shame and pain persist at various levels  pitting brothers of the same nation  the same people  against one another  for ideological reasons.Rwanda constantly strongly encourages all efforts to ensure the peaceful reunification and independence of the Korean nation and the praiseworthy initiatives to bring about the lawful restoration of the unity of the German people.In that respect  Rwanda has been following with optimism the negotiations on the question of Cyprus that have been conducted under the auspices of the United Nations  and we hope that they will continue to be guided wholly by the principles of the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of States. We join other non-aligned countries in welcoming the Secretary-General's diligent efforts to promote constructive dialogue  the demilitarisation of Cyprus  and the immediate withdrawal of the forces of occupation and exploitation.The wind of detente  which is blowing in the sky of international relations  and the prospects for world peace which it raises  will be described in the history books of mankind as the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream of all the peoples. The international community must take this unprecedented opportunity to strengthen peace and solidarity among men and must make full use of the provisions that exist and the actions that have been taken to support disarmament  nuclear demilitarisation  the reconversion of the oceans into zones of peace  the non-militarization of outer space  and the reduction of tensions wherever they exist.In this vital area of disarmament  the many facets of which will once again - and more than ever before - be the focus of the General Assembly's attention at the present session  Rwanda wishes to express here unequivocally its unswerving support for negotiations aimed at the maximum  decisive mobilization of minds so that there will be the determination to put into effect all the stages of general and complete disarmament. In particular  we strongly urge the United States and the Soviet Union to preserve what has been accomplished by the dialogue that is under way in this sphere  to the great joy of the entire United Nations family  and to continue to the end to deserve the confidence they have aroused in the international community.We are optimistic about the noble initiatives to ensure detente that have been undertaken between East and West. We welcome not only the general relaxation of tension which is gradually becoming evident in the world political climate  in respect of regional and local conflicts  but also the ushering in of a new era of democracy and freedom in the world  in particular in the Eastern countries.In addition  it is imperative  in our view  that this process of detente be extended to the solution of the economic and social problems in the world - in particular the plight of the poorer countries. The North must become more keenly aware of the dangers posed by the iniquities in the world economic situation  which in their way are just as dangerous as the arms race or the deterioration of the environment.A world dominated by a new ethic of peace; a world in which everyone stands together and from which the noise of guns and the nuclear threat as well as all forms of violence  terrorism and discrimination will be banished; a world that will be freed once and for all from the consequences of colonialism and racism and will be characterized by understanding  dialogue and co-operation: that world is within the reach of peoples of good will and is in our view the most natural aspiration of all men.Rwanda earnestly hopes for the flourishing of detente and the ushering in of a new era of peace and equity and social and economic progress. We express again here our determination to work unreservedly for those goals in our internal policies and in our relations with the States that cherish the noble ideals of the great family of the United Nations and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Rwanda has deep faith in the United Nations  which represents the most appropriate international body for the maintenance of the movement towards peace in the world and for the peaceful settlement of disputes. More than any other organization  the United Nations is empowered to lead the oppressed peoples to freedom and self-determination.More than ever before  the United Nations must promote more just international co-operation in every area in accordance with the sovereign equality of States. It has recorded an impressive range of successes  particularly in the area of the maintenance of peace  for which it won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize  which reflects great honour on us all.Rwanda supports the noble ideals of the United Nations and sincerely hopes that in order to ensure greater efficiency and success  the organization will always be scrupulous in working on the basis of realistic and realizable objectives. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the United Nations bodies devoted to the economic and social development of the world. Special thanks goes to those who are working tirelessly for the well-being of the most vulnerable groups - children and mother. That is why continuing efforts must be made to provide the necessary resources.The Republic of Rwanda expects the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly to make great strides forward  and appeals to all Member States to further strengthen their cohesiveness and solidarity so that we may progress towards the realization of the ideals of our Charter  which are based more clearly than ever before on the vital need to establish a new  better balanced and more just international economic order that is fair to the traditionally disadvantaged countries of the third world. We believe that that is the most realistic and safest way to guarantee for all mankind a future of peace  security and full development."
"121",6045,"SAU",44,1989,"ï»¿His Royal Highness Prince Saud Al-Faisal  Minister of Foreign Affairs  would have liked to be here today to address this Assembly  but compelling reasons relating to developments in the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to help bring about a settlement of the Lebanese problem made it necessary for His highness to remain in the Kingdom at this time. He asked me to convey his greetings to you  Mr. President  and to deliver his statement on his behalf.""It gives me pleasure to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  a tribute to you personally and to your wide experience in international affairs  and a tribute to the important role played by your country both regionally and internationally. I am confident that your presidency of the General Assembly at this session and your efficient conduct of its affairs will help to bring about good results. ""I avail myself of this opportunity to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session  who conducted our work with objectivity and wisdom that earned him tine gratitude and appreciation of all. ""It is also ay pleasure to reiterate our thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cullar  for his untiring efforts during this year  as in previous years  to strengthen opportunities for peace and reduce tension in crisis areas  as well as for his persistent endeavours to solve international problems  whether political or other. His personal qualities have contributed greatly to what has been accomplished in these fields.""The role of the United Nations in providing for a climate of detente  thereby contributing to the processes of reconciliation and the resolution of disputes  and in facilitating the means to eliminate the causes of dangerous conflicts between States is a major objective of the United Nations Charter. It gives us pleasure to witness the fact that the United Nations is performing .his role and to see that the super-Powers in particular have recognised that in the United Nations they have a body to which they can turn for help in realising the present stages of detente. There is no need to explain our appreciation of the importance of multilateral relations and their positive influence on bilateral relations. In discussing the importance and usefulness of multilateral relations  I must mention the constructive role the Gulf Co-operation Council is playing within the framework of the Arab League in co-ordinating and unifying the foreign and internal policies of its member States. We welcome the formation of the Arab Co-operation Council and of the Maghreb Unity Council  which incorporate two groups of Arab countries within the Arab League and which aim to consolidate co-operation and cohesion among them. We see in this regional cohesion within the framework of the Arab League an effective practical support of the League's objectives and of the goals of the United Nations.""Just when we are witnessing the many indications of relaxation in the relations between the great Powers and indications of improvement in the nature of the dealings between adversary international blocs  at a time when the world is looking forward to the transformation of confrontation among the great Powers into a process of understanding and of the solution of conflicts by peaceful means  and just when the threats of a global war with weapons of mass destruction are gradually abating  raising great hopes that the danger of a nuclear war between the two blocs has receded far enough to give us a feeling off peace  we now find that world-wide dangers are beginning to appear on the scene  impede mankind's development and jeopardize the very existence off the human race if they are not dealt with in time.""The multifaceted environmental problems and the dangers created by industrial progress make air and water unsafe for use  imperil the livelihood off man and the life of animals and jeopardize agriculture and the soil. Moreover  the damage and disruption to which the upper strata of the atmosphere are being subjected will affect life on Earth in general. ""Then there are these deadly scourges  such as the spread of drugs by dangerous and criminal organizations with abundant means at their disposal that cross geographic borders  violate the sanctity of families and societies  break all moral human and spiritual bounds and spread these poisons fatal to the human spirit  sapping human vitality in its march for a safe existence  and leading to the destruction of citizen's character  the disintegration of social bonds and the dissolution of the individual's commitment to family  society and State. The United Nations has been alert to all those dangers at an early stage and  thankfully  it has called for the mobilization of the efforts worldwide to face then.""In the economic field  the situation of the developing countries is increasingly deteriorating  and fee poor countries are becoming poorer and the rich countries richer. The problems of debt  protectionist policies and declining prices of raw materials  as well as fee gap between fee developing and the developed countries  and the underlying causes and consequences  are fee most important problems requiring an urgent solution.""The fact that the leadership of the United States and the Soviet Union have reached fee present stage of understanding and are convinced of fee need to co-operate is a development worthy of our great appreciation  for their wisdom and ability to open up prospects favourable for their peoples and for mankind. If the steps taken during the last two years are sufficient indicators  we have reason to hope feat despite difficulties this spirit of agreement will continue  unhampered by any elements of destructive rivalry  which must be guarded against. He hope feat fee present understanding  mutual negotiation and co-operation portend a period of stability that will help us solve global non-military problems as well as regional problems which impinge upon the rights  security and peace of peoples. If this trend continues  we see an important role for the United Nations and its organs as effective instruments facilitating international understanding.""At a time when international detente holds out promise for the solution of problems  the question of Palestine is entering such a critical phase that a special stand is required of the United Nations and its Member States  and all of us must shoulder our responsibilities in this regard.""More than 22 years have elapsed since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In order to annex those areas  the Israeli authorities resort to prevarications  despite the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly and the overwhelming opinion of the international community rejecting and condemning those Israeli attempts and calling for their termination.""Then there was the sweeping Palestinian uprising. Twenty-three months have passed since the intifadah began. The Palestinian people  all of them - men  women  the elderly and children - have risen up against occupation and injustice. They confront Israeli occupation authorities and all their instruments of oppression and tyranny as people defending their right to their land against an occupier that threatens their livelihood and existence. Peace is still an aspiration that Israel rejects  and it continues to place obstacles in the way of its attainment. That has been so since the Arab peace initiatives began to receive the support of the international community. In this regard  I refer to the initiative of the Fez Summit of 1982  the resolutions  of the Palestine National Council of 1988 and the steps taken by the Palestinian leadership  including its proclamation of the State of Palestine.*""On this occasion I extol the role of our sister State Egypt under the leadership of President Hosni Mubarak in supporting the inalienable legitimate rights of the Palestinians  even as Israel's intransigence hinders every initiative to solve the problem end obstructs every effort to achieve peace.""The Israeli authorities' inhuman treatment of the Palestinian Arab people is the greatest threat to any peace plan  and the worst possible policy feat they could pursue if they wish to establish a proper human relationship with the Arab people. Israel must accept reality; there is no alternative. And the reality is that the Palestine Liberation Organization is the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. 'It should realize that the sacrifices made by the Palestinian Council in putting forward a formula for peace in Palestine provide Israel with an opportunity for peace. The Israeli authorities must realize that this great sacrifice by the Palestinian people is the high price they are paying in the quest for peace and security and preservation of their national identity.""Also of concern to Palestine are the Arab lands occupied by Israel in the Syrian Golan and in South Lebanon. Invasion and occupation are not acceptable; they are intolerable  and must be brought to an end as quickly as possible. ""But Israel views the Middle East as a single field  including the Arab Maghreb and some countries of South West Asia  and in that regard its policy is to build rockets and prepare weapons of mass destruction  including deadly nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons. We must never forget that those are all weapons of total annihilation  and it is our inescapable obligation to see to it that they are destroyed in their entirety. Calling for their partial destruction is contradictory  as is the demand that weapons of mass destruction be limited. The long-range missile the Israeli authorities fired at the Libyan coast  in the Mediterranean  confirms that peace and security based on humane considerations is far from the minds of Israeli politicians. But of course they will frighten no one.""Are we likely this year to see a better understanding of the components necessary for the achievement of peace  with the Israeli authorities proving there has been a change in their assessment of what is right? Or will Israel ruin all opportunities for peace by insisting on an Israeli kind of peace that can never be achieved? ""With respect to the situation in the Gulf  we express our appreciation to the Governments of two neighbouring countries  Iran and Iraq  for adhering to their commitment to the cease-fire. That is a necessary step towards ending the war and for progress towards building essential bridges of peace between two neighbours following the horrors of bloody warfare they endured for eight years.""It must be pointed out that the state of no war no peace is always characterized by unacceptable surprises and that peace must be the goal. Both parties accepted Security Council resolution 598 (1987). He commend Iraq for its initiative in this regard. The Secretary-General and his staff have made great efforts to break the deadlock in the current negotiations. There is an urgent need to remove humanitarian problems as points of contention  precisely because they are humanitarian and because that will have a very positive effect on the spirit of the negotiations. In this regard  I want to refer in particular to the prisoners of war. As always  we shall support the Secretary-General and his staff in their efforts to reach a final solution to this conflict which threatens the security and peace of the countries in the Gulf region  as well as international security.""The tragedy of Lebanon has reached a stage at which it threatens the foundation and the safety of the State. At the recent emergency Arab summit conference held In Casablanca a decision was taken to authorize the high-level Arab Tripartite Committee - composed of the custodian of the two holy sites  King Fahd bin Abdulaziz; His Majesty King Hassan II and His Excellency President Chadli Bendjedid - to find a comprehensive solution to the Lebanese crisis. The Committee has put forward a special perspective to solve the problem - a perspective that includes a draft plan for national reconciliation.""Thus far  the High Committee has had important successes. It achieved a cease-fire  and it convened a meeting of the Lebanese parliamentarians  which is taking place at present in Taif  in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For 12 days those parliamentarians have been working continuously to reach anagreement that will restore peace to the country  and constitutional institutions to the State  will result in political reforms  and will establish Lebanese sovereignty over all Lebanese national territory.""The custodian of the two holy sites. King Fahd bin Abdulaziz  in the name of the Tripartite Arab Committee  has emphasized the need for the brothers in Lebanon to have a unified conception that will enable them to define the future of their country according to the formula that they think will preserve the unity of the States its land and people  and will ensure lasting peace and comprehensive stability. King Fahd has exhorted all the Lebanese parties and other parties concerned with the Lebanese issue to intensify their efforts to secure success for the endeavours to achieve the beneficial goals that everyone is striving for in this respect.""The Israeli forces must be withdrawn from South Lebanon in accordance with the Armistice Agreements of 1949 and in implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978). He are very hopeful - indeed  confident - that stability  security and peace will return to the land of Lebanon  and that that country will regain its civilized and constructive role and will be able to look forward to a tomorrow when peace will repair that war destroyed.""We reiterate our appreciation of the Soviet Oh ion's courage in deciding to withdraw from Afghanistan and to adhere strictly to the withdrawal date. We hope that the Soviet Union  having made that brave decision  recognizes that the regime holding out in Kabul brought upon Afghanistan the horrors of more than eight years of civil war. It will not be easy for the mujahidin and their provisional Government to reward that regime by having it share in governing the country and administering the affairs of the people who suffered at its hands  the horrors of war  destruction and expulsion  and at the same time to honour the regime with the prestige of a State and fee esteem of Afghanistan's people.""The continuing intransigence of the regime will do nothing to repair the rift with its neighbours. It will do nothing to build bridges of understanding and good neighbourliness. A failed regime that could not ensure safety and tranquillity  or even impose itself by force when it was propped up by a superior foreign army is finished and is on its way out. Attempts at bargaining will only serve to prolong fee tragic suffering of fee Afghan people. This heroic people set one of the best possible examples in sacrifice  in defence of their religion  their honour and their homeland. They demonstrated to all who seek freedom that there is a clear way  which does not tolerate bargaining.""The problem of Namibia is entering its final stages. That country is on the threshold of enjoying independence. We hope feat the world community will continue to press for a comprehensive solution until Namibia attains complete independence. The methods of prevarication and procrastination to which the Government of South Africa is resorting  in order to foil the implementation of fee United Nations plan in one way or another  will only have negative results in South Africa. That Government should learn from the experience of others who preceded them in colonizing Africa and who preceded them in departing from Africa  we will be glad  in the near future  to welcome Namibia as a free  Independent State and as an active member of fee community of nations.""South Africa  with its system of apartheid  is  resisting the winds of change and fee storms of adjustment that are overcoming apartheid and racial discrimination everywhere  especially on the African continent. Despite some signs of comprehension and understanding brandished by fee regime in South Africa  the wide gap between the ltoite minority and the black majority and the repugnant relationship between them  to which the minority is clinging  are a warning of the dangers to the security and stability of the region  a warning of what will happen if the responsible officials in South Africa do not wake up quickly to the evil consequences of their present policy  which is condemned by the whole world and which all States  including Saudi Arabia  are standing together to end.""It will not do South Africa and its Government any good to co-operate with the regime in Israel  overtly or covertly  in the field of trade  industry and finance or in the field of nuclear armaments  intelligence  illegal operations and training  because a system founded on apartheid is bound to change or come to an end.""As we all knew  polities cannot be set straight unless economics is set straight as well. In many respects the inter national economy was strong last year and at the beginning of this year. Gross national product in the industrial States increased by 4 per cent in 1988  and international trade increased by 9 per cent - one of the greatest increases over the last 10 years. The rate of employment in industrial countries increased by 2 per cent in 1988  while the rate of unemployment decreased from 7.S per cent to 7 per cent. ""Against that picture  we still see the gap between the industrial countries and the developing countries widening. Official assistance and financial support to the developing nations have decreased. Many developing countries use considerable amounts of their financial resources to make payments to debtor countries. The gap is therefore widening between the industrial countries  where economic performance is improving  and most of the developing countries  where economic performance is worsening because of their economic problems  which constitute one of the most serious obstacles to international understanding  despite the climate of detente to which we pointed earlier.-The decrease in the price of the raw materials exported by fee developing countries still represents a major obstacle on the path to their growth and economic development  at a time when those countries ate also facing a rise in the price of manufactured goods imported from the industrialized countries. The developing countries are still dealing with development problem in the face of increasing difficulties because the industrial countries  especially those which used to rule some of there  have left to their present Governments the burdens of poverty and backwardness. These industrial countries have not carried out their responsibility to support human and material development projects in the countries that have gained independence. We still persistently call for the resumption and revitalization of the North-South negotiations and for them to work earnestly foe solutions to the problems that are impeding progress in this field. We also call for a curbing of the protectionist policies in the industrialised countries in tariff and non-tariff forms  which constitute basic obstacles to balanced trade and impede economic development  not only in developing countries  but also in the industrialized countries themselves. We also call for an intensification of the co-ordination of economic policies between industrialized countries in order to revitalize the world economy  support its stability and facilitate the incorporation of the developing countries into that world economy.""The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is playing a positive role in serving the world economy  and at the same time in giving assistance and support - mostly in the form off grants - to developing countries. We stress the importance of fee fact feat fee improvement in international relations should be accompanied by a reasonable balance in economic relations  especially since militaryexpenditure is supposed to decrease in the industrial countries which can thus demonstrate their good intentions by setting aside part of those savings to support development in the developing countries and improve fee trade balance. ""We look forward to the coming year and we are hopeful that international problem will be solved. At the same time  we shall shoulder our responsibilities  which are of no less importance  for solving those regional problem feet are threatening peace and security. We are hopeful that  when we meet next year  we shall be able to report actual achievements  so that we can assure coming generations feat the prospects for humanity are better than they were in the past."""
"122",6082,"SDN",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador Garba of Nigeria most warmly on his election as President of the General Assembly. Nigeria is a countrywith which the Sudan enjoys warm  close and friendly relations. We are sure that he will guide the work of the Assembly in a successful manner and with fruitful results.I also express the deep gratitude of my delegation to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the great ability with which he carried out his stewardship of the forty-third session.We would also like to renew our thanks and gratitude to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the invaluable efforts which he has exerted in order to strengthen international peace and security.The Assembly is  I am sure  well aware of the latest political developments in Sudan. These developments aim at rectifying the situation in our country on the bases accepted by our people. These are: the principles of good-neighbourliness; the peaceful settlement of disputes; the promotion of mutual co-operation at regional and international levels; the deepening of the principles of non-alignment; respect for international instruments; and the peaceful solution of problems that confront our country. In this connection it must be noted that current initiatives and efforts aimed at solving the problems of the Horn of Africa by peaceful means receive the full support of my Government. We hope that these initiatives will bring about stability and complementary security in the region within the framework of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States in the region.The guest for peace in the Sudan has been and still is one of the main priorities of my Government. Peace  in our view  should be achieved through direct negotiations and dialogue. These have already commenced and we hope they will be pursued until lasting peace  national unity and stability prevail in our country. The Sudan is still faced with enormously complex economic and social problems. The Assembly at its forty-third session dealt with some aspects of these problems in adopting a resolution on emergency economic assistance to Sudan following the rains and flood disasters. The Assembly also adopted a resolution on special assistance for the problem of displaced persons. And in the past year the international community accorded priority to the largest humanitarian relief operation in the region when the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched Operation Life-line in the Sudan to save thousands of people in the southern regions from starvation and death.While Sudan is grateful to the Secretary-General and the international community for providing this highly appreciated assistance in our ordeal  we look forward to continued efforts by the international community to implement the resolutions adopted by the Assembly at its forty-third session which called for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the infrastructure destroyed during the rains and flood disasters. This is in accordance with the commitments that were undertaken last November. International assistance should also be extended to the displaced southern Sudanese in the Eastern and Western Sudan when primary factors of production are available  so as to enable them to be self-sufficient. It is also our view that assistance in the medical and health fields should be continued.In talking about the great success scored by Operation Life-Line Sudan  particularly in protecting the citizens in that part of the homeland from a devastating famine during this autumn  we should not forget the strenuous efforts exerted and the pioneering role assumed by Mr. James P. Grant  Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  who led the operation in his capacity as the Secretary-General's Special Representative  and ""his colleagues. Indeed  Operation Life-Line Sudan would not have succeeded had it not been for the positive response and support that Sudan received from donor States and various voluntary organizations  in particular from the United States of America  the European Economic Community and the International Committee of the Red Cross.My Government fully understands the human dimension of Operation Life-Line Sudan and is firmly committed to the need for the continuation of the international effort to realize the objectives spelled oat in the Khartoum Plan of Action. It is for this reason that my delegation will submit  at the current session of this Assembly  a draft resolution calling on the international community to demonstrate its solidarity win and support for Operation Life-Line Sudan in its upcoming phase devoted to rehabilitation projects.The last few years have witnessed a renewed interest in peaceful accommodation by the two super-Powers and the relaxation of tension in international relations. The intention of the various parties to resolve conflict in international relations through peaceful negotiations has been confirmed. This favourable international climate enabled the United Nations to play its predictable role with efficacy and considerable success. The United Nations has made valuable and constructive contributions in this regard. Vet more is expected from the United Nations by way of the realization and strengthening of international peace and security.These new beginnings have evolved to create an international climate that is favourable to stability and requires increased mobilization for its consolidation. Sudan therefore welcomes the progress achieved in the area of disarmament and the concrete proposals made to reduce armaments. Sudan also welcomes the constructive proposals recently announced by the two super-Powers on chemical and medium-range weapons.The beginning of this month witnessed the convening of the Ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Countries during which the Heads of State and Government adopted important decisions aimed at consolidating peace and boosting the prosperity of mankind. In welcoming all these efforts we hope they will evolve into concrete achievements that will realize the basic aspiration of the international community to avert the dangers of armament and war. This new rapprochement and political  cultural and economic co-operation between countries and groups with different political systems will give impetus to the consolidation of international peace and security - all the more so when it becomes evident that the mutual interests that bind people and countries are stronger than the political and ideological differences or disputes over narrow interests. These positive trends are ushering in a new era for mankind and we trust that all will duly contribute to it.Since the General Assembly met last year in its historic session at Geneva and the international community's recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State on its own soil  the Palestinian people  under the leadership of its sole  legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  and by the Group of Arab States has demonstrated its acceptance of the international community's decisions as all the United Nations resolutions with a view to paving the way to a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East.For its part  Israel continues to challenge the international community and flout United Nations resolutions. This makes Israel the main party responsible for the deterioration of the situation and the escalation of the conflict. As a result of this obdurate Israeli attitude  the Palestinian problem  unlike other problems in other tension areas  has not shown any progress towards a just and comprehensive settlement that preserves the rights of all parties.What Israel purports to present as an election plan is no more than a plan to consecrate its occupation that daily escalates its bloody and oppressive practices against the Palestinian people. Elections are based on the idea of free will  but what free will is there for a people denied the right to self-determination?The intifadah of the Palestinian people in occupied Palestine is the glowing culmination of a long  valiant and courageous struggle. The will of the Palestinian people will not be sapped by Israeli occupation. The intifadah proves that the denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people will lead only to deadlock. The international community has no option but to strive in an effective way to force Israel to comply with its rule and implement United Nations resolutions regarding Palestine and Israel's withdrawal from Palestinian land and all occupied Arab territories.My country continues to follow with grave concern the bloody events to which the sisterly people of Lebanon are subjected. However  the recent success of the Arab Tripartite Committee to convene the Lebanese House of Representatives and the meeting of the Security Committee give us cause for optimism regarding prospects of an agreement that will bring about peace and security in Lebanon.The present situation in southern Africa is of grave concern to us. The Brazzaville Protocol and the New York Agreements of last year sparked hopes for a full implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia. But the Pretoria regime is manipulating the implementation of the independence plan and persistently violates its text and spirit in an attempt to weaken the political position of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and ensure its own future hegemony over  and colonial rule of  Namibia even after completion of the plan.South Africa has not dismantled neither Koevoet nor the South West Africa Territorial Force  which are still actively terrorizing the people of Namibia by every means. Those terrorist strike forces are a real and very serious threat to the security and safety of the leaders and members of SWAPO and to their legitimate political activity.Some of the repressive and discriminatory laws are still in force  for instance the AG-8. Some political prisoners are still behind bars and amnesty is restricted to Namibians in exile and does not include Namibians inside their country  which leaves them exposed to threat and terror by the State.With the elections in sight next November  South Africa is already manipulating the process to rig the elections. The Voters Registration Act  exclusively set up by the Pretoria regime  allowed the moving of thousands of white South Africans into Namibia and registering them there for the elections. South African military and police staff and civil servants of the colonial rule stationed in Namibia can also register and vote. South Africa's Administrator General has introduced two pieces of legislation that are a flagrant and grave violation of the principles of free and fair elections. The draft on elections does not provide for the secret vote and has loopholes that allow rigging in vote counting.The draft on the Constituent Assembly effectively denies the people of Namibia its right to self-determination as it installs the Administrator General as president of the Assembly with veto power.The international community is now required  more than ever before  to monitor closely the independence plan for Namibia. We call on the Security Council to fully assume its responsibilities as stated in its resolutions 435 (1978) and 640 (1989). Enough funds and facilities must be made available to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) to enable it to fulfil its assigned duties. The massive popular reception that SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma received at home this week proves beyond doubt the full support of the people of Namibia for SWAPO. This support will certainly be reflected in the results of the forthcoming elections  if the international community guarantees that they are truly free and fair.The situation in South Africa remains the same  despite political changes there. Apartheid is still in place. The Pretoria Government is still most aggressively repressing the resistance of the people of South Africa to this notorious system and refusing to heed the universal demand of the international community that it release the militant leader Nelson Mandela and his comrades. Condemnation is not enough. Nominal support of the struggle of the people of South Africa is not enough. The international community is required to confront the racist regime and strictly implement its boycott in order to completely isolate it and enable the people of South Africa  under the leadership of its legitimate representatives  the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) and the Pan Africanist Congress (PAQ   to gain its legitimate rights.The international community has witnessed with great appreciation the efforts of the United Nations and its Secretary-General which have resulted in the establishment of a cease-fire in the long  bitter and destructive war between Iraq and Iran. Although this achievement created hopes and optimism  we observe with concern the lack of progress in the negotiations between the two parties to the conflict. We call upon the two countries to confirm their peaceful intentions and respond positively to the efforts of the international community represented by the United Nations  and to work constructively to resolve the complications of the war and settle the conflict comprehensively and conclusively by peaceful means within the framework  and through full implementation  of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). This settlement  we believe  is an essential precondition for repairing the ravages of war and mobilizing both countries' potential for reconstruction and the national welfare.The Geneva accords reached in 1987 between the parties to the Afghan question and the subsequent withdrawal of Soviet troops from that country raised hopes that national reconciliation in Afghanistan was imminent  but it has not materialized so far. We call upon all the Afghan parties concerned to contribute constructively to reaching national reconciliation and unity without which neither security  stability nor reconstruction can be achieved. We carefully observe the recent developments in Cambodia and call upon all parties to work sincerely to achieve the goals that will realize the aspirations of the people of Cambodia for independence  sovereignty and national unity. We hope to see the Korean people move towards achieving their aspiration to reunify their homeland through peaceful means  free from foreign interference.We hope that the initiatives for reconciliation and the elimination of tension in Central and South America will lead to general and comprehensive security and peace and thus contribute to the stability and development of the region. This prompts us to speak of the dangers to which Colombia is exposed because of its war against the mafias of illicit traffic in drugs. We hope the international community will support the Government of Colombia in its attempt to root out drug trafficking  which is a threat to security and stability in the region.The international scene has witnessed rapprochement between the two super-Powers  and peace has been achieved in many places in the world  but this is not reflected in the fields of international economic co-operation. We hope that the monies released by arms reduction will be put into programmes of economic and social development in the developing countries within the framework of international economic co-operation.The priority in this direction is to set up a just international economic and monetary system that will help these countries to overcome backwardness  poverty and stagnation. This cannot be done unless the international community fully assumes its responsibilities and seriously exercises political determination in addressing problems of growth and development in the developing countries. Foreign debt is the primary obstacle to any effort to promote economic growth. The Sudan recognizes the encouraging initiatives of some creditor countries and dreams that efforts in this sphere are not enough; they must be supplemented by effective steps to accelerate financial flows into the developing countries to support their national developmental efforts and expand their economic capacity. These steps are necessary to enable those countries to embark on the course of repaying their debts and to activate broader  more comprehensive co-operation to the benefit of both debtors and creditors.The conception of economic and technical co-operation has become an integral part of the general political awareness in the developing countries. The changing scene of the international economy offers opportunities for co-operation that must be utilized through a forthright dialogue between the rich and the poor countries to the benefit of both. Efforts must be made to control the net flow of resources from the developing countries to the developed countries and the multilateral financial institutions  thus depriving the developing countries of vitally needed resources. The progressive drop in the international prices of primary commodities is of grave concern to the developing countries  and we hope that the establishment  last June  of the Common Fund for Commodities will contribute to improving the present state of trade in primary commodities. We welcome the global system of trade preferences and consider it a necessity to strengthen its mechanism in favour of the developing countries  particularly considering the current trend of protectionism.Having passed through the ""lost eighties""  the developing countries view with hope and optimism the nineties  the fourth decade of the International Development Strategy  when the lessons of the past will indeed help in setting new concepts of international economic solidarity. We look forward to the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  especially in developing countries  and to the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  to be held in Paris. We consider them important steps towards establishing the solidarity of rich and poor countries for development  elimination of poverty and consolidation of the basis for self-reliance.We should like to draw attention to the dangerous situation resulting from environmental deterioration  particularly desertification  drought  ecological imbalance  climatic changes and the depletion of the ozone layer. We also draw attention to the dangers of exporting nuclear and industrial waste and dumping them in the developing countries. We call upon the whole international community to bear jointly the common responsibility to control environmental deterioration and share its burden  while noting the necessity of achieving sustained and ecologically safe development. The many important and urgent matters on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly and the favourable international climate offer a great opportunity for the international community to confirm its sincere commitment to the Charter of the United Nations. This will promote the efficiency of the Organization and is a guarantee of the establishment of international peace and security and the enhancement of international co-operation in all other fields.Finally  we hope that this session will achieve fruitful results which will make it a landmark in the annals of our collective effort."
"123",6127,"SEN",44,1989,"ï»¿The Senegalese delegation  through me  wishes to convey to you. Sir  its warm congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It is a well-deserved tribute to both you and your great country  Nigeria  which is a friend of my country. Your personal qualities as a seasoned politician and a distinguished diplomat  and the wealth of experience you have gained in the United Nations system certainly guarantee that our work will proceed successfully.May I here reiterate our deep gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  who so skilfully directed the debates at last year's session of the General Assembly  and to reiterate our unreserved support for Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the Secretary-General  for the talent and devotion he has evinced in his tireless activities in the service of peace  development and the strengthening of the role of the world Organization.Last year  from this very rostrum  distinguished people expressed their joy at the new era of dialogue and understanding which had been engendered by improved relations between the united States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It is very gratifying to note that this atmosphere of detente and co-operation is continuing and even growing  as indicated by the winding down  aid the considerable progress made towards the settlement  of a number of regional conflicts whose constant deterioration had for long been a feature of international relations.The start made  on 1 April 1989  in the implementation of the plan for Namibia's independence the signature and implementation of the tripartite agreements by Angola  Cuba and South Africa-  the initiatives taken by Africa to promote national reconciliation in Angola} the conclusion of the Algiers Agreement  by which Libya and Chad have finally embarked on the course of the final settlement of what remains of their dispute} the opportunities provided by the ongoing efforts of the Secretary-General of the united Nations and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in the matter of Western Sahara-  all these are events which allow us to hope for peace in these parts of the African continent. Similarly  in Central America  the process underlying the so-called Arias plan has been confirmed and strengthened as a result of the Tala agreements of 7 August 1989.More recently  the Paris International Conference on Cambodia suspended its work on a note of hope. We congratulate France and Indonesia  the co-Chairmen of that important Conference  and we urge the Khmer parties and those directly concerned to seize this historic opportunity to ensure that their professed desirefoe peace aid national conciliation in Cambodia is translated into fact. The current session of the General assembly provides an unequalled opportunity for the international community to work to promote conditions which will favour the resumption and conclusion of the Paris Conference  taking duly into account the very realistic and constructive proposals made by the Democratic Kampuchean resistance.Finally  the persistent action of the Secretary-General in Cyprus  despite the persistence of real difficulties there  should also be encouraged.We welcome this significant progress which is the result of the political will displayed by the parties directly concerned  as well as of the contribution of other protagonists on the international scene  first and foremost the great Powers.Our Organization's role  which has been visibly strengthened over recent years  has made it possible for it to take a more active part in maintaining this positive and dynamic process and  in particular  in carrying out its main responsibility of maintaining international peace and security through operations such as those under way in Lebanon  Iran and Iraq  Angola and Namibia. We must safeguard that credibility at all cost. In this connection  current events in Namibia  where the united Nations is engaged in the broadest peace-keeping operation ever undertaken  will test the maturity of this world body.Another indication of the strengthened role of the united Nations is the activity of the Security Council. Working energetically in an atmosphere of calm  cordiality and openness  the Security Council has effectively reacted whenever the international situation so required. Senegal has the honour and privilege of being involved  for the second time  in the work of that important body as a non-permanent member  whose term of office of two years will conclude at the end of this year.Discreetly but also resolutely  my country has endeavoured to make a positive  consistent contribution to the activities of the Council in a particularly eventful period. We all share the responsibility to safeguard the current public image of our Council  an institution which has been made more effective by a propitious political climate in which  together with the other members  the non-aligned countries play a notable role through their constructive ad concerted approach ad their determination and solidarity in the defence of just causes. This optimistic picture of the world situation and the role of our Organization should not lead us to overlook the fact that a great deal still remains to be done in Palestine and in Lebanon people are still suffering from foreign occupation? apartheid continues to make millions of innocent victims in South Africa? although the guns have fallen silent in the case of Iran and Iraq  peace is slow in coming? in Afghanistan the Geneva Agreements still have to be made a reality? and other hotbeds of tension have emerged.The deteriorating situation in the occupied Palestinian Arab territories and the dangerous impasse in efforts to find a political solution are the two main features of the Middle East question. Senegal deeply regrets the lack of any appropriate reaction by Israel to the courageous initiatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Just as every time it has been a matter of having law triumph over force and supporting the valiant struggles of peoples against oppression and domination  my country was among the first to recognize the new State of Palestine. It is fitting that I should reiterate here the glowing tribute the Head of State  His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf  and the Government and people of Senegal paid to Chairman Yasser Arafat  the National Palestine Council aid the fraternal people of Palestine.Given the impasse created by the lack of any positive response from the Israeli Government to the constructive position adopted by the Palestinian side  the 10-point proposal put forward by President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak constitutes a powerful initiative which could well pave the way to a process of fruitful dialogue between the Israelis and the Palestinians.At this time  everything mist be done to induce Israel to respect the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the protection of civilians in time of war  in order to safeguard the protection of civilian populations in the occupied Palestinian territories against the repression of the Israeli occupation forces  which are striving in vain to stifle the intifadah.The situation in the Gulf remains a source of concern. More than a year after the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq  there is still no peace. Senegal appeals to both parties to demonstrate more flexibility in the negotiations under the auspices of the Secretary-General for the full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (19 8 7).As current Chairman of the Summit of Francophone States - a family to which Lebanon belongs - Senegal makes a similar appeal to all those who are involved in the Lebanese tragedy for the peace plan initiated on behalf of the League of Arab States by the Kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and the Head of State of Algeria to receive their full support and for peace to be restored in that war-torn country.In addition to existing conflicts  there are tense situations which may well explode and join the list of numerous problems facing our world. It is strange indeed that such situations should persist  given the impressive means provided to member States by the United Nations Charter for the prevention and settlement of conflicts.In response to the concern expressed in this connection by the Secretary-General  the General Assembly at its forty-third .session adopted the Declaration on the Prevention and Removal of Disputes and Situations Which May Threaten International Peace and Security and on the Role of the United Nations in this Field (resolution 43/51).Senegal appeals to all the train organs of the Organization and Member States for direct concerted action to prevent conflicts. The Charter provides an appropriate legal framework  aid that Declaration not only enshrines the political will of Member States but also contains the necessary guidelines and recommendations to that effect.Among other instances where this united Nations policy to eliminate situations which may affect international peace and security can be applied  Namibia must indeed be a test case.The Security Council  which bears particular responsibility in the process of bringing independence to Namibia  after having adopted  by its resolution 435 (1978)  the necessary steps to ensure free participation in the electoral process leading to the speedy accession of the Territory to independence  continues to play an active  positive and constructive role in support of the Secretary-General's efforts.It is our duty  for present and future generations  to make a success of ""Operation Namibia"". That is why  as the united Nations independence plan invites us to do  we must ensure that the ballot is organized  the elections themselves are held end their results are certified only provided that the Secretary-General's Special Representative has  at each and every stage  verified the equity and applicability of all the measures relating to the political process.Without a firm and vigorous position being taken by the international community  together with constant vigilance to ensure that South Africa scrupulously respects both the letter and the spirit of resolution 435 (1978)  the sacrifices of the Namibian people under the far-sighted and courageous leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization may well come to naught  as well as the efforts which have been made hitherto  and the whole process under way may be called into question once again. The selfless devotion of the members of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group  that exemplar of international solidarity  would thus be ill rewarded  with incalculable consequences for the preservation of international peace and security.If we can be firm and resolute  vigilant and committed  the valiant Namibian people will shortly see the dawn which heralds its freedom and independence. In that case  we would deserve the confidence the peoples aid Governments of the world have placed in the united Nations and in the fundamental values it represents and could heartily welcome the new State of Namibia into the united Nations family.While the situation in Namibia is a matter of deep concern  that which prevails in South Africa is a source of even greater anxiety  with the reinstitution of the state of emergency  the outlawing of anti-apartheid political organizations  the censorship of the press  arrests without trial  the imposition of the death sentence on political opponents despite appeals for clemency by the international community  as well as the organization of elections which are essentially anti-democratic because they exclude the black majority. Is it not high time for Pretoria to understand that it is pointless to try to swim against the current of history? South Africa should be aware that it will never be able to stem the heroic struggle being waged by the African National Congress  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and the anti-apartheid organizations to bring to that country a non-racial  democratic and equal society. It is true that some signs seem to indicate that there have been certain tentative changes in perception. Until the proclaimed intentions are embodied in an effective policy which will in fact put an end to apartheid  we mist remain on our guard and increase our pressure on the Pretoria regime. My delegation will have occasion to revert to this when our Assembly holds its special session devoted to apartheid in December 1989.While there has been a decline in tension in international politics  while a number of regional conflicts are being pacified aid there is growing hope of peace  the international economic situation is becoming more and more disquieting. Those who are victims of it are essentially the men  women and children living in the regions of Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Caribbean  which are faced with socio-economic realities which in many respects are worse than those which prevailed 25 years ago. Subsistence societies populations with no hope  exposed to famine  poverty aid natural disasters  desertification and locust infestations; economies devastated by interminable crisis; the marginal treatment that is all that is given to the economies of developing coin tries; and the exclusion of those economies from decision-making processes regarding the international economic situation - that is the harsh reality faced by the developing coin tries.Of course  there are certain prospects which may still give us a glimmer of hope. That is true  for example  of the forthcoming special session to be held in April 1990  a session of the General Assembly on economic co-operation. It is also issue of the Paris Conference in September 1990 on the least developed com tries  and the eighth session of the united Nations Conference on Trade and Development  in 1991. But how many such meetings on which our people have hung their hopes have finally proved to be totally disheartening with respect to any tangible results?Thus in a year and a half the fifth anniversary of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development will be reached. But  the critical economic situation in Africa  whose recovery arid development were the two main purposes of that Programme of Action  is far from having improved. On the contrary  it is worsening as the days go by. As was clearly indicated by the mid-term appraisal  the response expected from the developed countries and international financial and development institutions has been far from commensurate with the efforts and constraints the African countries have imposed upon themselves.Therefore  in future  to make the best of what happens to us  we must bring to bear much more our sense of solidarity and shared responsibility.In another area  the agreed international target in the field of public aid for development  adopted by the Assembly 20 years ago  has still not been attained  and current trends  according to experts  seem to be moving towards stagnation and even regression.As far as financial flows between North and South are concerned  the fact is that there has been an unprecedented net transfer of resources from South to North  notwithstanding commitments made particularly in the case of Africa at this very place in May 1986  which very clearly indicates the growing gap between the developed world of the North and the underdeveloped world of the South.Turning to the external debt of the developing countries  if certain remedies have been mooted today  a global and final settlement is still a thing of the future. Speaking from Mi is rostrum in September 1987  we noted with satisfaction the decisions taken by a number of countries to cancel or convert into gifts the public debt contracted by African countries seriously affected by the crisis. Today it is our pleasure to welcome the decision  announced in Dakar by President  Mitterrand at the third summit meeting of French-speaking African countries  to cancel as of 1 January 1990 all debts with respect to development aid in the case of 35 African countries. My country is also gratified that similar decisions have since been announced by Belgium and quite recently by Italy.If it is clear that these unilateral and transitional measures offer relief to the recipient countries  it is none the less evident that if they are to be fully effective they should be followed up by general structural measures which would be the outcome of a multilateral consultation between the debtors on the one hand and creditor nations and international bodies on the other.Finally  what can we say that has not already been said of the situation besetting the commodity prices of the countries of the South  whose constant decline has led to even greater vulnerability for economies already undergoing structural adjustments for which they have paid a high price in human and social resources?This gloomy picture of the world economy should encourage us to take a more realistic look at things and to be more disciplined in our actions. It calls for genuine concerted action patterned after the groundwork already done in certain fields such as disarmament  the environment  drugs and the settlement of international conflicts.The collective impulse which has been noticeable for some years in connection with the dangerous arms race; the progress that has been or is now being achieved in the effort to bring about effective disarmament; the praiseworthy initiatives taken to protect the ecological environment? the desire which mobilizes everyone  both peoples and Governments  to carry out an implacable struggle against drugs; and the political will revealed in the approach taken to defusing and resolving international conflicts are all indicative of two things that the world has become aware of - first  the oneness of our environment  irrespective of the diversity of its security  military  health and social components  as well as ecological  political and economic factors  and  secondly  the need to meet the major challenges of mankind in a concerted  joint and peaceful way.Let us not be mistaken. Neither the countries of the North themselves nor exclusively those of the South can meet all these challenges - not only because pollution  drugs  chemical weapons and other strategic weapons do not respect State borders and should be treated on a world-wide basis  but also because each of these questions incorporates a number of aspects whose relation to economic and social development is essential. Thus  the whole range of problems relating to drugs reveals the link between the economy  health and society  and the question of waste products reveals the relationship between industry  ecology and development? the question of disarmament illustrates the interrelated complex of security  peace and development  just as efforts to eradicate underdevelopment must necessarily include the twofold dimension of  on the one hand  furnishing incentives foe production  particularly by boosting commodity export earnings  and  on the other  relieving the debt burden and improving social conditions in the underdeveloped countries.When we take an overall look at the relations and interactions between these various problems  we must realize that we are facing a system that is a homogeneouswhole  and that the necessary pre-condition for real progress is simultaneous action on all of the different elements of that system. It is in this context that we should view the initiative taken in July 1989 by the Heads of State of Egypt  Senegal and Venezuela and by the Prime Minister of India to re-institute a North-South dialogue on natters of common concern for both hemispheres  aid also through regular summit consultations. This initiative has already gained the support of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  and here  of certain delegations. I have no doubt that the Assembly will give it the necessary world support so that it may become a reality in the near future.Among the most painful realities at the end of this twentieth century  famine is undoubtedly the most repugnant  both because of its persistent nature and because of its manifestations. Indeed  it is really unacceptable that  while in the northern hemisphere  overproduction and over-consumption lead to enormous waste - a barely tolerable level of waste - elsewhere  every passing minutes takes a death toll of thousands of people who are dying from hunger  including a large number of children in the third world in general and in Africa more specifically. The spectre of children  women end old people dying of hunger must be removed forever. That is possible - and indeed  it is less difficult than one might imagine  because there are means available to us.Three years ago the head of the State of Senegal  His Excellency President Abdou Diouf  receiving the Africa Leadership prize of the Hunger Project  which was then being awarded for the first time  put forward the idea of a world-wide front for the eradication of hunger in Africa and throughout the world before the end of the century. This campaign  particularly in Africa  was designed to reverse the trend towards deterioration of the food situation and increasing dependency on external sources  to preserve the ecological balance of the continent and to promote the emergence of new systems of production and protection of more better suitable crops.On behalf of the Senegalese delegation  I pay a tribute to those who have taken the initiatives of putting forward at the present session a proposal that this last decade of our century be declared the decade for the elimination of hunger throughout the world. It is my hope that this project will take shape very rapidly with the active assistance of all countries and international agencies concerned  and that the objectives of that decade will in fact be achieved on the threshold of the third millennium  in 10 years' time.I have just referred to children as being in the forefront of those who fall victim to famine. While famine is one of the main causes of infant mortality  it is not the only factor that can be regarded as a violation of the rights of this fragile yet essential component of mankind which is the child. Thirty years ago  in order to afford protection to children  the international community adopted the Declaration on the Rights of the Child. 1989 is also the tenth anniversary of the International Year of the Child. This twofold commemoration should  we believe  provide us with an opportunity to stress the need to give better protection to children and to promote the interests of this precious human resource by adopting an appropriate legal framework that will regulate the fundamental rights of children in all their aspects. To that end  Senegal co-sponsored the draft that became resolution 43/112 of 8 December 1988  in which the General Assembly requested the Commission on Human Rights to give the highest priority to the draft convention on the rights of the child and to submit it to the assembly at its forty-fourth session.In keeping with its cultural values  Africa has been constantly associated with the efforts made by the international community to promote and protect the rights of the child. In many countries of the continent  major initiatives have been taken to benefit children as part of the international year devoted to the protection  survival and development of the African child  proclaimed by the OAU in 1988.I should therefore like to echo what has been said by other members of the international community to the effect that not only should the draft convention on the rights of the child be adopted before the end of the present session of the General Assembly  but that it should be ratified by all Member States as soon as possible and the long-awaited summit on children should be held shortly.I have referred to the questions of the environment and drugs. I shall not say anything more about these  except to reiterate the determination of my country to continue to afford its full co-operation in matters of the protection of the environment. It has already done this by participating at the highest possible level  at the beginning of the year in the Netherlands  in the meeting of Heads of State that resulted in the Hague Declaration  and by proposing  in Geneva this year  that protection of the environment should include measures for combating desertification and drought  which are a matter of priority for a number of countries  including African countries. Likewise  Dakar recently hosted two important ministerial meetings on the marine environment of the Atlantic and on industrial waste. Finally  it was on the initiative of my country that the most recent summit conference of the OAU proclaimed 1990 the African year for the environment.Regarding efforts to combat drugs  to which Senegal attaches major importance  here I should like to announce that the Senegalese deputies  meeting in special session  are at present considering a bill that would authorize our country to ratify the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in narcotic Drugs and psychotropic Substances  which will make my country the first State in Africa aid the second in the world to ratify it.In other words  Senegal fully supports the bold steps taken by Colombia which have been supported by other countries  including the united States of America  to struggle against this scourge of our times. We likewise subscribe to the idea of an international meeting on this important issue.In conclusion  if I have devoted the latter parts of my address to the question of improving the international legal order  that is - as delegations know since our countries share the same conviction - because Senegal has always adhered firmly to the primacy of law.In this connection I cannot fail to note with satisfaction the conclusions reached at the meeting of the non-aligned countries on the primacy of international law  held at The Hague this year to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of the first peace conference.My country has promoted the primacy of law to a cardinal principle of its domestic political system as well as its foreign policy.Internally  my country's well-known commitment has taken the form of a multi-party democratic system with 17 distinct political formations  some 20 newspapers and periodicals  and open elections.Externally  Senegal has made respect for international law a sacred standard of conduct  both in time of peace and in periods of crisis  together with its distant and neighbouring partners. Through me  it reiterates here and now its firmdesire always to respect  and always to ensure respect for  international law  starting with that which defines the frontiers we inherited when we acceded to independence and which define our territorial identity within the international community of States."
"124",6174,"SGP",44,1989,"ï»¿First of all  let me congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. Your unique and illustrious background as soldier  political leader  scholar aid author  and your wide experience in multilateral diplomacy will no doubt provide you with the particular sensitivity and skills required to guide us through the complex issues of the United Nations agenda. My delegation has absolute confidence in your abilities. We pledge our fullest co-operation. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Ronald Spiers on his appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Political and General Assembly Affairs and Secretariat Services. I am confident that he will bring to his responsibilities the highest degree of professionalism  which was the hallmark of his predecessor. May I also express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo for carrying out his duties so diligently and admirably during the last session.Last year was an exceptionally good year for the United Nations. For the international community  long used to the unending eruption of wars  disputes and conflicts  never had the promise of peace been so close to realization. Agreements were reached to end the war in Afghanistan and to establish a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq. In December  agreement was also reached to usher in Namibia's transition to independence. The United Nations peace-keeping forces were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their contribution to peace-keeping. Multilateral diplomacy was patently yielding results. The prestige of the United Nations had never been greater.This year  in 1989  we are a little less euphoric. We are sobered by the realities and the difficulties of the resolution of conflicts among nations. While some progress has been achieved on several fronts  we are keenly aware of the problems that still stand in the way of peace. Eight months after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan  the fighting and the killings have not abated. The talks to end the Iran-Iraq conflict have stalled. We are alarmed at the worsening situation in Lebanon and the stalemate  if not retrogression  in spite of earlier progress  in the resolution of the question of Palestine. We await the long overdue birth of independence in Namibia with the keenest interest. Singapore feels privileged to be able to contribute to the achievement of this goal through our participation in the united Nations Transition Assistance Group police contingent. We are also honoured that the leader of our police contingent  Superintendent lee Kok Leong  has been appointed chief electoral officer to oversee elections in Namibia. But we are disturbed at the attempts by South Africa to circumvent the implementation of some key aspects of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence as contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978). We must continue our vigilance to ensure that nothing will derail the transition to independence aid prevent the full implementation of free aid fair elections in November. After Namibia  the international community should help to hasten the pace of fundamental change in South Africa to end the abhorrent and evil apartheid system.The Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  in summing up the problems of peace-making in his report on the work of the Organization  said:""I am all too conscious how thorny is often the path leading to a just and lasting settlement aid how hard is the resistance encountered."" (A/44/1  p. 12) I fully agree with him. If there is a lesson to be learned in all this  it is that there is no quick fix to peace.When a major Power comes to the conclusion that military power cannot be used to achieve political objectives and that dialogue with a global rival is more fruitful than confrontation  it ushers in a more auspicious international climate. But we have clearly learned this year that even when the major Powers are prepared to settle their conflicts a necessary but insufficient condition for the attainment of peace has been met. The key that unlocks the door to peace in regional conflicts is often in the hands of the parties directly involved. All that is needed is one inflexible and intransigent party to block the peace process.We are also aware that  even as we have to work harder on the problems of international and regional conflicts  a new generation of problems compelling urgent attention has come on out agenda - problems such as drugs  the environment  refugees and debt. Those problems recognize no borders and  if left unattended  could complicate and threaten the wider and long-term security of the international community and our search for peace.Among the nations in South-East Asia  the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a whole has done well. We have progressed because our national stability has allowed each of us to concentrate our attention on our internal political  social and economic development. This in turn contributes to ASEAN's resilience and cohesion. We had hoped that the same peaceful and stabilizing conditions would be achieved in Indo-China  but  alas  the Cambodian conflict remains an intractable problem. It is now 11 years since the Cambodian issue was first brought before the Security Council in January 1979 after Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day in 1978.For 10 years the international community spoke through the United Nations resolutions  calling upon Viet Nam to end its occupation of Cambodia and to accept a comprehensive political settlement which would bring lasting peace to the region. Such a comprehensive political settlement would provide  among other things  for the withdrawal of foreign forces under effective international supervision and control  the creation of an interim administrative authority  the promotion of national reconciliation under Prince Sihanouk and the right of the Cambodian people to choose their own leaders free from outside interference.Our efforts at the United Nations were not without impact. Initially  Viet Nam denied that its troops had invaded Cambodia. later  when this untruth was exposed  Viet Nam arrogantly declared that the situation in Cambodia was irreversible. But continued United Nations pressure and international isolation  denying Viet Nam valuable aid and investment  forced it to concede for the first time  in 1986  that it was prepared to reach a political solution. What Viet Nam had not taken into account was the strength and resilience of the Cambodian nationalist resistance. The high cost of foreign occupation brought its economy to the brink of bankruptcy. Now that the Soviet Union is keen to reduce its burdens abroad  the option of a continued Vietnamese presence in Cambodia cannot be ensured. Viet Nam has readied a point where it has to reconsider its strategy.On 5 April this year Viet Nam dramatically announced to the world its intention to withdraw ail its troops from Cambodia by the end of September. In recent days  we have seen photographs and newspaper reports of Vietnamese soldiers departing in military trucks. It is certainly a major media event  but what are we as responsible Governments to make of this announced withdrawal? Are we to conclude that the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia ended on 26 September as Viet Nam claims it did? Are we to conclude that the problems of Cambodia are now all resolved? Is there no further need for the United Nations to continue to debate and discuss the issue of Cambodia?The most significant point to note about the announced withdrawal is that  first  it is a unilateral withdrawal undertaken without a comprehensive political settlement in place. The withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops has not been effectively verified. We have no way of knowing if the withdrawal is genuine and total. There was only a handful of media journalists  several observers from some non-governmental organizations and representatives of the few countries that havediplomatic relations with the Him Sen regime who had gene to Phnom Penh to observe the Vietnamese departure This motley group could not honestly verify that there are now no more Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Indeed  the united Nations technical fact-finding mission dispatched on agreement by the Paris Conference on Cambodia reported that even in the best of circumstances it would be difficult to verify satisfactorily the exit of the Vietnamese troops. The terrain and the poor infrastructure and transportation system in Cambodia makes systematic supervision and control very difficult.Secondly  this is the eighth time that the Vietnamese have claimed to have withdrawn their forces from Cambodia. In the past  as in July 1982  May 1983  Jime 1984  April 1985 and May 1986  Viet Nam had said that it was withdrawing its troops from Cambodia  but each time we learned that those withdrawals amounted to no more than a rotation of troops. We are therefore justified in being sceptical about the present withdrawal. Our scepticism is supported by an article in the 27 September issue of the Bangkok Post which reported that some East European sources had told its correspondent  Mr. Jacques Bekaart  that some Vietnamese troops had been left behind in Cambodia.Thirdly  there still remains the vital question of Vietnamese soldiers who are staying behind as militia of the Hun Sen regime aid as settlers. Viet Nam has not contested the existence of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia. The argument is over the numbers. Viet Nam claims feat there are 80 000 Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk says there are about 1.3 million. Some Western diplomats in the region estimate the figure to be between 300 000 aid 400 000. The issue of the number of settlers is important as this determines who has a right to vote in the internationally supervised free aid fair elections that come with a comprehensive settlement  and therefore the right to choose the Government of Cambodia.In my case  Viet Nam has not entirely relinquished its right to intervene again in the affairs of Cambodia. In several statements made since the 5 April announcement of Viet Nam's intention to withdraw by the end of September  Viet Nam has asserted its right to send its troops  or whatever other assistance  to Phnom Perti if it feels that the survival of its puppet regime is threatened by resistance guerrillas.There are therefore considerable doubts whether the Vietnamese have completely withdrawn from Cambodia. However  even if we could document that Viet Nam had completely withdrawn its forces  I submit that the United Nations should still continue to debate and discuss fee Cambodian issue. Some nay argue that the united Nations role should be limited to discussing violations of the United Nations Charter and that united Nations interest in Cambodia should cease when foreign intervention there ends. 'A> understand the fallacy of this argument  let me cite an analogy* if the South Africans decided to withdraw their forces from Namibia but insisted cm leaving in place the Windhoek regime as the exclusive Government of Namibia  without giving the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) the right to compete in fairly held elections  we would immediately denounce South Africa aid declare that fee Windhoek regime had no legitimate right to rule Namibia since it was installed by foreign occupation forces.That is precisely what Viet Nam is trying to do in Cambodia. After withdrawing most of its forces  it continues to insist that the Hun Sen regime  which was put in place by the foreign occupation forces  should continue to rule Cambodia. That is why the Paris Conference failed. The three Cambodian parties led by Prince Sihanouk  which are recognized as fee legitimate representatives of the Cambodian people by the Assembly  by the United Nations  were willing to share power with Mr. Him Sen in an interim quadripartite coalition Government until free  fair and democratic elections were held under united Nations supervision. They were prepared to allow the Cambodian people to determine who should rule them  demonstrating their commitment to the most fundamental principle of the United Nations Charters that a people's right to self-determination should never be diminished.Viet Nam and Mr. Him Sen opposed this  declaring that Mr. Hun Sen should enjoy a monopoly  or near-monopoly  of power in Phnom Penh. They knew that by doing so they would give the nationalist forces led by Prince Sihanouk no choice but to launch a military struggle to secure their legitimate right to self-determination. Both Viet Nam and Mr. Hun Sen want to trigger off this civil war. We are sad that the Cambodian people  who have now suffered fear almost 20 years  continue to live in agony. But it is Viet Nam and Mr. Hun Sen who are responsible for this state of affairs  and they should be condemned for it.After raising the hopes of the Cambodian people through our principled and moral stand over the past 10 years  we cannot disappoint them by abandoning them at this crucial hour when they are so near to securing real liberation. The United Nations can and should help the Cambodian people by insisting that there should be a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian problem. The international community must insist that it can never accept anything less than this. Such a comprehensive political settlement must give the Cambodian people the right to determine their own future in free  fair and democratic elections under international supervision. Only this will end the civil war and allow the Cambodian people to breathe freely again.The exercise of self-determination in Cambodia must be based on national reconciliation of all Cambodian parties. All parties must have a stake in the future of Cambodia  lb attempt to exclude any party as a pre-condition for national reconciliation is unrealistic and irresponsible. It is tantamount to inciting the prolongation of conflict and bloodshed. That is why Prince Sihanouk has wisely and realistically called for the formation of an interim quadripartite Government of all four Cambodian parties. This interim quadripartite Government will have the responsibility of organizing free and fair elections. Since all parties will be involved in organizing the elections  all will be bound by the results.No matter what we  as individual countries  may think about any Cambodian party  only the Cambodian people have the moral and political right to determine who should or should not rule Cambodia. Nobody else has that right. In exercising their right to self-determination through free and fair elections  the Cambodian people will finally be able to pass their verdict and judgement on the Khmer Rouge. The inter national community has the obligation to help create conditions that will enable the Cambodians to exercise freely their political choices  and to respect their choice  whatever it may be. The international community should recognize that the Cambodian people will have the wisdom to choose wisely.Let me restate the central issues of the Cambodian problem. First  the total withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops must be verified by the United Nations  as only the United Nations can provide an effective international supervisory  monitoring and control mechanism. Secondly  the Cambodian people must have the opportunity to exercise the right of self-determination  which is a basic right of all peoples under the united Nations Charter. Thirdly  none of the Khmer parties should be denied the opportunity to stand for election under the comprehensive political settlement  as only the Cambodian people have the right to decide who should govern them; the exclusion of any party should not be made a pre-condition for a settlement agreement.My country  Singapore  does not bear any historical animosity against Viet Nam. But why have Singapore and our Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners championed the cause of Cambodia so energetically in the past decade? We have done so because Viet Nam's invasion and occupation of Cambodia have threatened the peace and stability of South-East Asia. we have done so because Viet Nam's action  if not repudiated  would set a very unfortunate precedent. Viet Nam must not be allowed to get away with only partially solving the problem. If it succeeded  it would have demonstrated that aggression pays. It would have shown to others that it is possible for one country to invade another country with impunity  set up a client regime  and after a long enough interval walk away from the mess it created  leave a resistance war raging and go back to business-as-usual with the rest of the world. That would create a dangerous precedent. For all peace-loving States of the international community  we must not accept this dangerous precedent. It would put our security in jeopardy if this should become acceptable international behaviour.The Cambodian issue has been a success story of the united Nations. This may sound paradoxical but it demonstrates that international moral pressure does work. Through the united Nations resolutions adapted year after year  with increasing support  we have forced Viet Nam to change its position over time. We have come this far. Viet Nam is taking the first step towards the resolution of the Cambodian question by thinning out its troops in the field. But the problem is far from being resolved. We at the united Nations must continue our moral suasion to convince Viet Nam that it has the responsibility to settle the Cambodian question comprehensively in the interest of a just and lasting peace for the Cambodians and in the interest of regional security and stability. When Viet Nam contributes to the comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian issue  peace will return to Indo-China. When there is peace in Indo-China  the international community will help in its reconstruction. Viet Nam will finally be able to concentrate on its cam internal economic and social development and reap the fruits of prosperity."
"125",6207,"SLB",44,1989,"ï»¿Let me first congratulate Mr. Garba upon his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His elevation to that high office is a reflection not only of his competence but also of the esteem in which his country  the Federal Republic of Nigeria  is held internationally. We are confident that under his able leadership our deliberations will reach a successful conclusion.I should also like to commend his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  for the excellent manner in which he guided the work of the last session. To our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  I wish to pay a special tribute for his untiring efforts  which have brought significant results in the further advancement of peace. We are grateful to him.After being forced to remain in the wings for too long  we are heartened to note that with common sense prevailing the United Nations is at the forefront of international efforts to secure our collective desire for a better and peaceful world. The two super-Powers continue to sit together  talking peace. Even in places of seemingly intractable conflict the prospect of giving peace a chance is increasing. We are therefore witnessing a trend of world-wide rapprochement that has given greater meaning to the idea of peace  which we hope will be translated into a reality. Our presence here is intended to give encouragement to the extension and consolidation of those trends and efforts.In the Gulf  thanks to the cease-fire arrangement between Iran and Iraq  monitored by Use United Nations  the cessation of hostilities has now been effective for more than a year. This  however  is only the beginning  for Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  the basis for that peace  remain to a large extent un-implemented. We urge its full implementation and express our full support for the peace efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative. On Namibia  the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on its independence is a major advance which must be maintained so that free and fair elections to the constituent assembly  under the supervision and control of the United Nations  can take place next month. If those elections are to succeed it is essential that all the parties concerned respect the letter and spirit of the United Nations plan and other related arrangements to ensure that nothing is done which could cause them to unravel.No less significant are the winds of political change blowing across Western Sahara. We note that a breakthrough appears imminent in the 14-year-old dispute there and welcome the acceptance by the two parties to the conflict of the Secretary-General's proposal to work out the details of the implementation of the peace plan presented to them by the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). We encourage them both to continue their efforts to find a durable solution to the conflict.Pursuant to the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan  all foreign troops left Afghanistan in February of this year. Regrettably  the fighting still continues and has in fact escalated  increasing the suffering of the people of Afghanistan. With the massive importation across its border of military hardware to nourish the fighting  the problem in Afghanistan requires a political solution  which must come from the countries concerned. We therefore support the efforts of the Secretary-General to secure a political consensus that will eventually put an end to the unnecessary loss of life and suffering in Afghanistan.On the Cyprus question  we welcome the recent high-level contacts between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities and their commitment to achieving an overall settlement. The Secretary-General must be commended for his untiring search for a peaceful solution to the conflict. We therefore call on all parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General and his Special Representative wife a view to achieving an agreed settlement.While we have seen major advances towards peace emerging in the Gulf  Namibia  Western Sahara  Afghanistan and Central America  and super-Power rapprochement  it is indeed sad feat this new wave of accommodation and reconciliation still eludes other areas of long-standing conflict.The recent Conference on Peace in Cambodia  held in Paris  was a step in fee right direction towards ending two decades of war  destruction and human suffering. Regrettably  the Conference could not arrive at a comprehensive political settlement. Be that as it may  we should not give up hope of a negotiated political settlement but should encouragement to any efforts aimed at reconvening fee Paris Conference  which we hope will pave the way for fee people of Kampuchea to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination through general and free elections under fee auspices of fee United Nations.The lack of progress towards a solution to the conflict in fee Middle East continues to be a source of grave concern. We continue to regard an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations as fee best formula for bringing fee parties together in binding negotiations. The right of all to live within secure borders must be recognized and respected.Elated though we are about fee very positive developments in Namibia  we note wife concern feat the same cannot be said about South Africa. The exclusion of the country's blade majority from fee parliamentary elections last month made those elections a farce. The new leadership that emerged from the recent elections represents a change only of guard  not of fee policies of apartheid. We reiterate the call for comprehensive mandatory sanctions against South Africa and hope that the special session of the General Assembly planned for December will provide the impetus to translate that call into action.The situation in the Korean peninsula still requires constant vigilance. To assist in their efforts to arrive at a peaceful settlement of disputes in the Korean peninsula  we would welcome the admission of the two Koreas  whether simultaneously or separately  into the United Nations.Solomon Islands attaches great importance to respect for human rights and we cannot  therefore  remain indifferent to the violations to which those rights are subjected. The events of Tiananmen Square were indeed shocking. We hope the People's Republic of China will eventually heed the appeals addressed to them by the international community. In less than two months from this time next year we shall be commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations historic 1960 Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. By then Namibia will  we hope  have been admitted as the 160th member state of our organization. But happy as  we are at the prospect of Namibia's admission to the United Nations  we cannot become complacent until the legitimate aspirations of all colonized peoples for a free and genuine act of self-determination is realized.In New Caledonia  we note the positive measures taken by the Government of Prance which have restored peace and dialogue to that Non-Self-Governing Territory. We are encouraged by the agreements concluded in Paris last year and hope these will continue to form the basis of New Caledonia's peaceful progress to self-determination.It is also our hope that the Government of Prance will  in the near future  co-operate with the United Nations in accordance with Article 73 (e) of the Charter.It is our firm belief that  as in Namibia and other former Non-Self-Governing Territories  a free and genuine act of self-determination in New Caledonia must be in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations. This is also the collective belief of the 15 countries of the South Pacific Forum. At its recent summit meeting held at Tarawa  in the Republic of Kiribati in July of this year  the Forum's Final CommuniquÃ© was explicit on this question:""The Forum restated its strong support for an act of self-determination consistent with toe established decolonisation practices and principles of the United Nations  in which all options  including independence  would be open  and which would lead to a settlement that safeguards toe rights of the indigenous Kanaks and all New Caledonians in a multiracial society."" (A/44/463  para. 19)That is also the belief shared by my Melanesian brothers and Kanak leaders  and by the late Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene  whose tragic assassinations in May this year stunned us all. He shall continue to miss them. But it is up to is to keep their hopes and dreams alive and to ensure that they are translated into a reality. The commitment of the United States and the Soviet Union to cut their nuclear arsenals by 50 per cent  which we welcome  is a timely reminder that the possession of nuclear weapons is not a guarantee of genuine global security. We welcome also the proposals made at the beginning of this debate by President Bush  and the positive Soviet response  on the reduction of United States and Soviet stockpiles of chemical weapons. But big or small  developed or developing  all Member States have a commitment to global security and stability.The Treaty of Rarotonga  in the South Pacific  which declares the South Pacific region a nuclear-free zone  constitutes an important disarmament measure. It embodies a major security commitment for the South Pacific region and represents a solemn step in contributing to both regional and global peace and security. Solomon Islands ratified this Treaty last year and to date it has received 11 instruments of ratification from 11 countries in the South Pacific region. The Treaty entered into force upon the deposit of the eighth instrument of ratification on 11 December 1986.The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union  as nuclear-weapon States  have already ratified Protocols 2 and 3 of the Treaty. We command them for their sensitivity in accepting our contribution to what we hope will eventually be a nuclear-free world. It is  however  much to our regret  that the United Kingdom  the United States and Prance have not  as yet  heeded our concerns  and we urge them to do so by acceding to the Protocols of the Treaty. On the current economic situation  hard choices have to be made to narrow the widening economic gap between the developing and the developed countries. As an island heavily dependent on commodity exports. Solomon Islands places a premium on the final outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations  which we hope will take due consideration of the unique problem of island developing countries.Of the major issues confronting us today there is probably none that has captured our imagination more than the deterioration of the natural environment. The greenhouse effect  global warming  the depletion of the ozone layer  acid rain  waste dumping  forest depletion  and drift-net fishing  threaten our existence.The greenhouse effect and the resulting global warming and the rise in sea level constitute a direct threat  no longer dismissible  to our survival  we in the Pacific have more cause than many to be deeply concerned about it since if the rise in sea level is significant some of our islands and coastal areas may become Permanently inundated. The possibility that entire countries may also drown is almost beyond comprehension. we in the South Pacific  like other regions I believe  have our environmental problems. But the irony is that while these have contributed very little to the causes of global climate change it appears that we may be among the first of the innocent victims of its consequences - the first  but not the last. The sea  for many Pacific island countries  is our greatest resource. For some it may be the only resource drift-net fishing  or the ""wall of death"" as it is appropriately called  poses a problem  and undeniable danger to our marine resources. These ""ghost"" nets  15 metres deep and extending to about 60 kilometres  whose primary target is the tuna  suffocates almost anything that comes its way. Whales  dolphins  seals lid sea birds  in pursuit of what appears to be easy prey  are entangled  hopelessly in these nets. We believe drift-nets will seriously deplete albacore tuna rocks in the region over the next two years. This practice must therefore stop.We welcome the recent decision of Japan to cut by two thirds the number of its tuna fishing vessels using drift-nets in the South Pacific. We hope that this will be the first step towards ending drift-net fishing in the region.We call on Taiwan  which remains the only holdout  to heed the concerns of the South Pacific Forum and abandon immediately its damaging drift-net operations in the South Pacific. The Pacific Ocean is certainly the largest ocean in the world  but it is certainly not large enough to endure indiscriminate exploitation.Another danger which threatens our environment is nuclear testing. We therefore call on France to put an end to its nuclear-testing programme in the Pacific? It is not a reduction in the number of nuclear tests that we seek but a complete cessation of those tests. The bitter truth about the greenhouse effect  gill-net fishing  nuclear testing acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer is that their effects transcend .d national boundaries. It therefore demands an international response. It is time for all nations to join together in a common effort to protect our environment. lent.With conflicts reduced and dialogue resumed we are indeed witnessing a different political climate  a favourable climate that should now inspire the resolution of long-standing conflicts in other areas; an appropriate time also to inspire and consolidate international co-operation in economic development and the protection of our home and the environment. Global co-operation in the management of global problems is essential to our search for global solutions. Now is the time  so let us all rise to this momentous occasion and proceed to expand the frontiers of peace and harmony.This is the task  this is the labour  to which we must all bend our efforts. It is the earnest hope of my delegation that as we move into the last decade of this millennium  together  in unity  we can make further positive contributions towards achieving a better world."
"126",6300,"SLV",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like first to express our most sincere congratulations to you  Sir  upon your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at this session. We are certain that your wisdom and experience will enable this momentous gathering to follow a path that will lead to success at a time when very promising prospects of international understanding are emerging and when all the countries represented at this forum of universal harmony will be focusing on examining and discussing the many practical and tragic problems now facing mankind.I join in the appreciation expressed to Mr. Dante Caputo for the excellent manner in which he performed his task as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. This is a fitting occasion to emphasize here  at the Headquarters of the United Nations  our appreciation and admiration for the tireless and successful efforts made by the United Nations to contribute to peace  harmony  reason and development throughout the world. The efforts of the United Nations are bearing fruit at last. With the assistance of the overwhelming majority of the Member States and with the progressive development of the machinery of the United Nations  we see how it is having a beneficial impact upon mankind  increasingly anxious to live in harmony and co-operation. We note with particular appreciation the outstanding role played by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose career and achievements are a special source of pride since he is an outstanding Latin American figure.We have come  for the first time  to the rostrum of the United Nations filled with emotion and a sense of confidence in order to tell the world the truth about our country  the truth of a people which has suffered and is continuing to suffer from the devastating tragedy of an armed conflict that has gone on for 10 years now. During that time  in striking contrast  our people have managed to build democratic institutions which are unquestionable today  even to the most sceptical or most stubborn opponents.Those who wished to lead the international community to believe that our Government would represent a historic set-back for El Salvador  today  four months after we came to office  have to compare their distorted intentions or mistaken analyses with our attitude and our actions. In due course we shall refer to that attitude and those actions  but first we wish to re-emphasize  before the universal conscience  our philosophy and our vision of the present and of the future. No one who is even slightly familiar with the situation in our country can be unaware that the main challenge facing all Salvadorans today without exception is the final achievement of peace. We  elected by an overwhelming majority on 19 March of this year  fully grasped this need for peace and reconciliation for our people  and we took up the historic challenge of promoting peace by peaceful  democratic means.We inherited a shattered national community  a country oppressed by the violence that had gone on for more than 10 years and an economy in ruins  a ruinous State control and systematic destructive activities of extremist forces  together with a land crying out for the restoration of its spiritual values and creative and productive energies. Our commitment  from the very first day we took office - on 1 June - was to accept the responsibility of rebuilding and rescuing the entire society  leaving no one out and giving special treatment only to the poorest of the poor.In the face of the breakdown of our national community  we set out to work for the unity of all sectors in society  so that no one felt left out of the national destiny  so that no group  entity or sector might feel it enjoyed pre-eminence beyond the rules of harmonious democratic law.Prom the very first day of our administration we said that we intended to govern  not to rule  because we consider that the people of El Salvador deserve the utmost respect and total devotion of their Government  given my country's institutional maturity and great historic sacrifices. In this we have the firmest  most responsible and profound conviction: we are exercising power by the authority of the people  obtained in free elections that no one has challenged. Today and every day during our administration we shall put this power to the service of peace  progress and freedom for all Salvadorans. We foster the unity of all sectors of the country - political  social  entrepreneurial and labour - so that  with all due respect for the differences that are fully appropriate in a pluralistic democratic process  nevertheless  we Salvadorans can overcome the breaches resulting from bygone violent confrontation.Against this violence  which took advantage of the socio-economic shortcomings and the institutional mistakes and omissions of the past in order to disguise their ideological fanaticism  we are pitting political reason  measured co-ordination and patriotic arguments within the framework of democracy. This is a reality experienced every day in El Salvador. It is feasible to achieve power by peaceful  civilized means whereby the Salvador an people  which alone holds the right to sovereignty  is free and enabled to elect to office those who offer sufficient guarantees of honest  responsible work directed to the attainment of justice  legal security and the well-being of all.Imbued with our sense of the obligation to seek social harmony  to preserve peace and tranquillity and the safety of the human person as a member of society  we extended our hand to the insurgents inviting them to return to a peaceful role in our society where all ideological trends have their place today. Our wish for dialogue and our serious pursuit of peace are there for all the world to see.Our proposal for permanent  continuing  substantive  committed dialogue was met by an initial negative response by the insurgents. Then  as we outlined our commission for dialogue  they again refused. But  convinced of the need to exhaust all channels to achieve a political solution to this bloody conflict  we were prepared to find the necessary patience to achieve the first approaches. Without any arrogance or useless anger  we waited for a positive response. That finally came with the first meeting for dialogue between the Government and the FMLN 100 days after we took office and after some two years of stalemate in the dialogue.We are deeply gratified to be able to inform the international community today that on 13  14 and 15 September the first formal accord between the Government of El Salvador and the EMLN was achieved. It lays down the guidelines for permanent dialogue whereby substantial understanding  making possible the total solution to the conflict in the shortest possible time  will be brought about.The Mexico agreement is historic and significant because it sets out a framework whereby it is possible  through agreements  for groups that are still using weapons to have recourse  instead  to peaceful means to make their political proposals to the Salvadoran people.That achievement is not something we view as a personal triumph. We are presenting it to the international community as a first fruit of a new way of governing in El Salvador  free from hegemony  demagoguery or fanatical passions. We would repeat here in the General Assembly what we have repeatedly said to our own people: as far as we are concerned  we have clearly defined principles of freedom and democracy and no Salvador an is our enemy and no one should be persecuted because of the fact that he is our adversary.We are therefore required to fulfil the law and comply with the law  but we also intend to modernise and develop not only our laws but also the administration of justice at all levels of society. We are quite aware that achieving peace will be no easy undertaking. It will require sustained and vigorous effort. But we are also aware that our people will not be prepared to accept failure which would unduly delay further the attainment of peace. Time will tell  so we will wait and see. Consequently  at our next dialogue  on 16 and 17 October in San Jose  Costa Rica  we shall be making a proposal for the complete cessation of hostilities  to bring an end to the shooting within the spirit and letter of chapter III of the Tela Agreements signed in Honduras by the five Central American Presidents in their efforts to achieve firm and lasting peace in the area.We are not simply proposing a de-escalation of armed conflict; we think that that would mean merely a gradual reduction in the suffering of the Salvadoran people. That suffering - unjust  prolonged and terrible - must be brought to an end once and for all because there can be no moral or political justification for it. Like all men of good will we feel that fratricidal conflict  nurtured and sustained by ideological fanaticism  is the most irrational and hateful form of human rights violation. We have a clear commitment to respect and foster the human rights of the individual  a goal we reaffirm emphatically here today - and I should like my words to be heard around the world. We invite all political and social forces in our country  irrespective of their ideological hue  to join with us in this transcendental task of restoring full harmony in El Salvador on the basis of reasonable discussion  civilized procedures and a serious commitment to development  without which it will not be possible to achieve stable and lasting peace.To foster this development  which is so necessary and urgent  our Government has commenced a process of gradual economic adjustment based on the modern concept of liberalizing our economy  making possible the reactivation of productive mechanisms and releasing the creative energy of free enterprise. This wide-ranging programme is coupled with a lasting programme for social development which will help the most needy and vulnerable to take part in the drive for development. We do not wish to be systematic benefactors of the indigent but  rather  to equip them with real opportunities so that their poverty can be gradually eliminated. He know that this is a long-term and complex task. It is tantamount to the thoroughgoing economic take-off of an entire country. But if we do not set about this now as a practical  feasible task we shall never find the momentum to overcome the enormous effects of our crisis. Our economic approach is consistent with the new  liberalizing trends flourishing around the world. We are abreast of the times  and that will enable us better to face the clear needs and legitimate requirements of a society that is yearning for a life of peace  freedom and solidarity.We cannot aspire to the attainment of such a goal of collective humanism without a substantial effort to restore the spiritual and moral values of our land  shaken to the very roots by the scourge of armed conflagration. We are undertaking deep educational reforms to snake education more effective and enlightening. We ate incorporating at all levels the theoretical and practical lessons of human rights and duties  so that future generations of our land can grow up with feelings and convictions that will enable them to respect each other  to accept healthy criticism  to enjoy a democratic life and to love God and their homeland  and to have a deep sense of the need for universal coexistence.In that respect  we hope the Assembly will approve the draft international convention on the rights of the child at this session so that the children end adolescents of today and tomorrow can live in a more human world. Today we are witnessing the sad reality of the so-called children of war. That is why we are fully aware  personally  that the work of protecting and fostering children's rights mist be an immediate task if the harmonious world that we wish to see tomorrow is to be brought about. Over the past 10 years the conflict in Central America has been a subject of concern and anxiety for the international community. It was thought that it might give rise to an even greater crisis affecting world peace and security.However  since the signature of the Guatemala Procedure  the Alajuela Declaration and the Declaration of Costa del Sol  and  most recently  the summit meeting in Tela  the situation has gradually changed. There have been substantial changes in the political climate and new and better possibilities have emerged for the restoration of peace. There is no doubt that world detente has had an impact on Central America since it has been understood that confrontation and war are not solutions to any problem; that  on the contrary  instability and tension generate irreparable loss of life and do not contribute at all to improving the lives of our peoples. As Central Americans we are aware of our historical responsibilities  are taking the active role which we alone can take and are adopting our own decisions to resolve our regional crisis.The determination to achieve  and the real possibility of achieving  political solutions to our problems has demonstrated the illegitimacy of the use of force and violence. That is why the peace efforts have received constant support from the international community - most recently the Security Council's firm and unanimous support in its resolution 637 (1989) of 23 July this year. Today the way is open for further significant and valuable steps to be taken by the Secretary-General to foster peace and democracy in Central America  consistent with the wishes of our peoples as expressed in the commitments entered into by our Presidents.We are convinced of the need  feasibility  timeliness and legitimacy of the Esquipulas Procedure. I wish to emphasize here that we shall continue to fulfil the obligations that we entered into there. We want a firm  lasting peace. That is why we have accepted and constantly supported the establishment and dispatch of the United Nations observer group in Central America. It will be an extremely significant element in the verification of compliance with the agreements  particularly those with respect to support for and/or provision of territory to armed forces which destabilize legally constituted Governments. We urge the forces outside the region to respect the manifest will of Central Americans. They would thus be contributing to peace and democracy and the creation of an atmosphere compatible with reconstruction to assist our peoples.We consider the absence of democracy to have been the root cause of social and political conflicts in Central American countries and we also see that regional peace is intimately linked to the procedures of national and democratic reconciliation. For that reason we hope that political developments in Nicaragua will result in honest  untainted and open elections in which the Nicaraguan people will have a real possibility to exercise their inalienable right to choose their Government freely and  with equal freedom  to determine the system of Government most compatible with their national interests. We appeal to the international community to lend all due attention and assistance so that in the forthcoming elections in Nicaragua the desired objective can be attained. Understanding our problems and requirements  and in an act of fellowship which serves to strengthen the peace process in our region  the international community has extended support for the measures for Central American economic co-operation drawn up by the United Nations in co-operation with our Governments. We sincerely appreciate this collaboration inasmuch as progress towards these goals will also signify progress towards the solution of some of the most critical problems affecting the countries of Central America.At the same time  the Government of El Salvador wishes to place en record its appreciation to all those countries that have expressed their support for the peace process in Central America. Our thanks go to the donor community  which has played an active role in humanitarian and development activities. We thank also the relevant United Nations bodies for their work leading to the Central American Conference on Refugees  and for the special co-operation we have received from the United Nations Development Programme and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. We re-emphasize the value and significance  for all Central American nations  of co-operation and international assistance for the attainment of peace and development. We urge the international community to strengthen economic  technical and financial co-operation with Central America. Peace and development in our region will represent a further contribution to the attainment and consolidation of world peace and security.To the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  goes our special appreciation for the help he has extended to the Central American Presidents working to assist our peoples.In respect of the international economic situation  we are bound to regret that the economies of the developing countries have failed to make progress towards resolution of the main problems that beset our societies  which are constantly in a state of crisis. The traditional problems in the fields of health  housing  unemployment  inflation  marginality  poverty  and so on  have been compounded by other imbalances  such as the fiscal deficit and external debt  which  taken together  make even more difficult the process of economic recovery and development in general  and jeopardize the fragile stability and achievements in the political field. It is disturbing that  whereas in some parts of the developed world there is economic growth  conditions in the underdeveloped countries  instead of improving  are getting worse  with a widening gap between rich and poor. This confirms the existence of serious shortcomings in international affairs  which must be corrected so that the benefits of development may be distributed equitably. The international community  particularly the industrialized nations  must be aware that if this trend were to continue  the worsening crisis in our countries could  as has occurred in other regions  ultimately give rise to even greater social conflicts  which would ultimately have an impact on the economies of developed nations.Ours is an overwhelmingly agricultural country that depends to a considerable extent on the production of coffee. We are carrying out an extensive programme to diversify our exports and industry. Nevertheless  coffee continues to be our essential commodity. We therefore wish to make it clear that we feel that renewal of the International Coffee Convention is essential  we have begun a process of economic reconstruction in the midst of continuing conflict. We are deeply concerned  therefore  that there should be recovery in the coffee market  we believe that a just and equitable agreement would be a very promising sign of international harmony and co-operation.With respect to external debt  which is a terrible sword of Damocles hanging over the fragile structures of Latin American nations  El Salvador energetically calls for a solution that will take into account the development needs of our peoples and will show that creditors and debtors are jointly determined to stress the human factor  rather than cold statistics  thus demonstrating that the modern world is applying a philosophy of human rights  not only in respect of actual cases but also in respect of the great international problems. In the social sphere  the abuse of drugs  AIDS and international crime  and  at another level  the problems of terrorism and of the environment are subjects of concern to us all  as they have an impact on ail nations. However  we welcome the fact  that  finally  their negative impact  and the need for concerted  co-ordinated action by the international community  has been recognized. In view of the scale of these problems  and of their negative impact on the development of our societies  we must give urgent attention to them. We must do our outmost to achieve positive solutions.With respect to the specific issue of drug trafficking  we have heard here a dramatic appeal by the President of Colombia  His Excellency Mr. Virgilio Barco Vargas  who called for international co-operation. He asked the international community to endorse and support energetically his plan for joint action to eliminate this frightful scourge  which is undermining institutional life in our nations and ravaging our young. We firmly and earnestly support that urgent appeal. Indeed  we are prepared to support any measure  programme or collective step to combat this particularly inhuman and destructive crime. Just as we would reject any expression of terrorism  whatever the argument or pretext employed  we equally oppose drug trafficking  which  as President Barco Vargas rightly said  is a scourge that affects us all.Despite international detente and the progress that has been made in the resolution of a number of problems  there continue to be trouble spots that represent a threat to world peace and security. In all cases of conflict  we urge the parties involved to seek political understanding  making due use of the machinery for the peaceful settlement of disputes  and resorting to the facilities of the United Nations system  as on previous occasions when the Secretary-General has done vital work leading to the adoption of measures to resolves disputes. In this context  I wish to refer specifically to the case of Korea and to sake it clear that my Government shares the view that it is essential that the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to engage in permanent dialogue and establish the contacts that are necessary to strengthen mutual trust. Thus they could end all forms of hostility and confrontation and  finally  achieve peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless  bearing in mind the principle of universality to be found in the United Nations  we consider that the Republic of Korea possesses the essential elements of a State and that it has all the elements qualifying it for membership of the United Nations. That is an aspiration that  indeed  we support.I have come to this rostrum  from which have been heard the great voices of our times  to convey our humble but steadfast hope for peace and concord in El Salvador as a contribution to the enormous international movement against violence  dogmatism and intolerance. The walls are tumbling - north  south  east and west. We see this as a final freeing of minds around the world - an intense hope for an age in which the force of the spirit will become  once again  the driving force of history. The Government of El Salvador respectfully calls on the international community not to identify us with stereotyped vignettes  but  rather  to judge us by our attitudes and our actions. We want peace  freedom and justice in our long-suffering country  but we will never renounce any of the fundamental freedoms necessary for representative  pluralistic democracy to survive. We are not excluding anybody. We do not seek to pin the blame on anybody for his political ideals  but we call energetically on all to join us in building peace  as a demonstration to our own people  and then to the world  that we are a Government of peace  work and service.We hope to return here next year with good news of lasting peace in our country. But that does not depend only on us; we seek agreement that will unify the entire society of El Salvador. We  for our part  will do cur utmost to avoid further bloodshed in our land. Every day we remember the words of the Carpenter of Nazareth  the Saviour of the world  who  from the hill above the Sea of Galilee  in the brief sermon that has been left for mankind  said to the multitudes""Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God."" (The Holy Bible  Matthew 5;9)"
"127",6372,"SOM",44,1989,"ï»¿It is a great privilege for my delegation to participate in the deliberations of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I bring to you  Mr. President  and the delegations assembled here the warm greetings of the President  the Government and the people of the Somali Democratic Republic  and best wishes for the success of this important session of the General Assembly.Permit me at the outset  Sir  to extend to you the sincere felicitations of my delegation on your unanimous election to the high office of President of this session. Somalia has close brotherly ties with your country  Nigeria  which continues to play a leading and constructive role in furthering the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and in promoting world peace  freedom and development. We assure you of our fullest support and co-operation as you discharge your onerous responsibilities. I take this opportunity also of extending our congratulations to the other members of the Bureau.We express our deep appreciation also to Mr. Dante Caputo for the valuable contribution he made to the cause of international peace and co-operation during his term of office as President of the forty-third General Assembly session.Similarly  we pay a tribute to the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his total dedication to upholding the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter and his untiring and relentless efforts to strengthen the Organization as an instrument for the promotion of world peace  security and development. His illuminating report on the issues before us constitutes in our view a significant input to the deliberations of the current session of the Assembly.With the founding of the United Nations  mankind for the first time established a permanent institutional arrangement for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and co-operation among States. The Charter of the United Nations brought about fundamental changes in international relations  with far-reaching consequences. It expressed the determination ""... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person ... and of nations  large and small ..."". It thus recognized that for world peace to be lasting  it must be underwritten by the attainment of human rights. The Charter also established a new concept of international morality based on peace and justice among nations. No longer can we accept that force alone should determine disputes between nations. Each dispute must be judged in terms of its relative content and merit  and measured in the context of international law.The Charter of our Organization  in Article 1  upholds the right to self-determination of peoples under colonial rule  and enshrines it as a basic principle.A watershed in the history of the Organization's involvement was marked by the adoption in 1960 of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples  contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). The Declaration left no doubt about the position of the world community on the question of decolonization. Subjection of people to alien domination and exploitation was proclaimed a denial of fundamental human rights  contrary to the Charter. It also recognized the right of all peoples to self-determination and therefore the right freely to determine their political status and pursue their economic  social and cultural development. Further  the Declaration made it clear that the process of liberation is irresistible and irreversible and that  in order to avoid serious crises  an end must be put to colonialism and all practices of segregation and discrimination associated with it.The achievements of the United Nations in the fulfilment of the hopes and the aspirations of colonized peoples in Africa  Asia  the Caribbean  the Pacific and other areas to gain the independence of their homelands have indeed been historic. The threefold increase in the membership of the Organization is eloquent testimony to its great success in the field of decolonization. However  the final goal of making this body universal is yet to be attained. In direct contravention of the provisions of the Charter and the Declaration  in various parts of the world forces are dominant that oppose the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination and are thus blocking their emancipation. There are numerous examples of the violation of human rights by the brutal forces of occupation and repression. Powers and regimes that make the forcible denial of the fundamental right of peoples to self-determination the foundation and philosophy of their policy continue to hide their positions behind the shield of certain ""principles"" which they conveniently use to prevent action by the world community against them.The United Nations is under an obligation to oppose those forces and take concerted action in support of the legitimate aspirations of oppressed peoples. Somalia firmly believes that complete and full realization of the noble task of the total elimination of all forms of colonialism must continue to be a high priority of the United Nations in order to ensure justice and freedom to all peoples still languishing under the yoke of colonial domination and oppression. The Charter does not just stop at aiming at the creation of instruments of human rights  decolonization and peace. It also recognizes that the struggle against hunger  disease  deprivation and illiteracy would have to be waged on a global basis through the collective efforts of all nations. Peace would be fragile at best if the problem of economic and social injustice is not adequately addressed. The words ""global interdependence"" are no longer merely a fashionable term; they have become a key to the solution of many problems confronting our planet at the present time.In this context  it is a matter of deep concern to us that most of the developing countries continue to remain outside the mainstream of progress achieved in the world economy in recent years. They are in the throes of severe crises  which tie down their economies and strangle their development process. In most of Africa  for example  per capita incomes have continued to fall. Many of the poorest countries  particularly the least developed countries  have become even poorer. Unemployment in the developing world as a whole has increased enormously. The recovery in the price structure of primary commodities continues to be insufficient to lead to a fundamental change in the overall trend in commodity markets. The debt crisis which erupted simultaneously in many developing countries in the early 1980s  continues unabated  thereby severely straining their development efforts. Real interest rates have remained exorbitant  seriously affecting the economies of developing countries. A resurgence of protectionism in the developed countries continues to impede exports from developing countries. Official development assistance has stagnated and the private flow of resources to developing countries has fallen sharply. A newer and even complex dimension of the development crisis has emerged with accelerated degradation of the global environment  often caused by acute poverty. Thus  developing countries continue to remain prisoners to a system which is outside their control and which has only contributed to deepening and complicating their development crisis.Undeniably  the required acceleration of growth in the world economy and the integration of the developing countries in that process in an effective and long-term manner requires a supportive international environment. This should include an increased net flow of resources on concessionary terms to developing countries  to meaningfully supplement their own development efforts. This is necessary in order to facilitate the implementation of their structural adjustment programmes  modernize and diversify their economic bases  eradicate poverty  improve their environment and develop their human resources. The reactivation of growth in the developing countries will also depend on their ability to solve the serious debt burden. This acute problem must be addressed in an integrated and comprehensive manner without any further delay.The development crisis is dramatized by the plight of the least developed countries  which have been facing formidable structural handicaps and experienced extreme deterioration in their overall socio-economic situation. During the 1980s  despite significant domestic policy measures undertaken by them pursuant to the Substantial New Programme of Action  the effects of their adverse external economic climate have been further exacerbated by the failure to implement the recommendations of the Programme and its mid-term review. In this context  we would like to underscore the significance of enhanced international efforts to reactivate the growth and development of the least developed countries. We would also emphasize the importance of the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in 1990  which should adopt a substantial plan of action for the sustained development of the least developed countries for the 1990s.The prevailing economic situation in Africa calls for more effective implementation of commitments by developed countries to permit full realization of the objectives of the United Nations Programme of Action for the Recovery and Development of Africa  19 86-19 90.The socio-economic crisis that engulfed many developing countries  and particularly the least developed among them  has been further exacerbated by certain developments that have strained the capacity of these countries to survive. Somalia  for example  has become a host to large numbers of refugees  whose number has been swelling in large proportions. The international community has always recognized the Somali people as being the biggest donors to these refugees  who have been provided asylum at a considerable cost to the national economy and social development.Unfortunately  of late  refugees in Somalia have been experiencing drastic shortages of food  medicine and other relief aid which have created serious hardships and made their very survival almost impossible. While there is a need for a long-term refugee programme in Somalia  which my Government fully supports  we believe that the decision recently made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the World food Programme to suspend food aid to refugees is unjustified and will have serious implications for their survival. Humanitarian assistance to refugees must not be linked with political considerations. The long-term durable solution of the refugee problem should be the goal that we seek to achieve. Pending the attainment of that goal  the international community is under a moral obligation to continue to provide the refugees with the humanitarian assistance and support they need.The efforts of Somalia to promote socio-economic growth and development has been further impeded by the grave humanitarian situation that has developed in some of the northern districts of Somalia. Besides significant loss of human life caused by attacks against government installations and administrative centres by armed bandits  the situation has resulted in a massive displacement of the population and widespread destruction to public and private property. We are concerned about this grave situation.My Government is indeed grateful to the Secretary-General for his prompt decision to dispatch a fact-finding mission to the area to assess the humanitarian needs of the affected population. We would like to thank the United Nations mission which was entrusted with that task for the diligence with which it carried out its work and for the report which it has prepared and which is new before this Assembly.On its part  my Government has taken appropriate measures to deal with this grave disaster situation. Within the limits of its meagre resources  the Government extended all possible assistance to the affected population in terms of food  medical supplies and other basic needs. In view of the gravity and magnitude of this human problem a great deal of international assistance will be required. Unfortunately  the response of the international community so far has not been adequate. My Government appeals for the necessary support so that the programme for rehabilitation and reconstruction  as recommended by the United Nations mission  can be fully implemented.A review of current international developments would reveal that the relaxation of East-West tension and ongoing moves to deal peacefully with regional conflicts have had a sobering impact on the overall international situation. However  while the constructive role played by the international community in promoting solutions to the major problems facing the contemporary world could be a cause for satisfaction  there still remain many intractable problems and areas of conflict that continue to threaten international and regional peace and security  Somalia believes that disarmament is a moral imperative in this nuclear age. It is a sine qua non for attaining the most important goal of the Charter  namely the maintenance of international peace and security. The unrestricted arms race has rendered international peace and security ever more vulnerable. The situation calls for dialogue and meaningful negotiations and it was in this context that we expressed our satisfaction at the new spirit of rapprochement between the two super-Powers  it is our earnest hope that the recent changes in East-West relations will have a favourable impact on global disarmament efforts and the lessening of world tension.We are gravely concerned at the continuation of the conflict in the Middle East  which is a direct result of historic injustices and brutalities suffered by the Palestinian peoples who were forcibly expelled from their homeland. The question of Palestine is at the heart of the problem in the Middle East. The courageous uprising  intifadah  of the people of the West Bank and Gaza is an eloquent reminder that there will be no peace in the region unless the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are fully restored.The position of Somalia on this question is firm and consistent. We have always extended unequivocal support to our Palestinian brothers in their struggle for the restoration of their inalienable rights to self-determination  freedom and independence  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PID) - their sole and legitimate representative. We welcomed the establishment of an independent State of Palestine by the Palestine National Council last year and were among the first States to recognize it. Somalia is one among the many countries which have consistently supported the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation of Palestine on an equal footing with other parties. We believe that the Conference will provide a unique opportunity for negotiations on the basis of the constructive resolutions of the General Assembly on the Middle East. This session of the General Assembly should undertake a decisive course of action in support of the peace process in the Middle East.Another area of major international conflict is southern Africa. It is imperative for all of us to do everything possible to wipe out the last vestiges of colonialism  racism and apartheid in southern Africa. Somalia  an active member of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid  is irrevocably committed to the cause of the oppressed people of Namibia and South Africa in their just and legitimate struggle for freedom  liberty and human dignity. Somalia welcomes the commencement of the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibia. The Secretary-General deserves our deep appreciation for his historic contribution to the Namibian cause. However  in this context I should like to enter a caveat in respect of the backdrop of the rapidly unfolding events in Namibia arising from manipulations and manoeuvres by the racist South African regime  including widespread intimidation and harassment of the civilian population aimed at frustrating the process of Namibian independence. We call upon the international community immediately to ensure conditions in Namibia that would enable the Namibian people to participate freely in the electoral process under the supervision and control of the United Nations leading to the early independence of the territory. Somalia urges the Secretary-General to do everything in his power to ensure that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is implemented in its original and definitive form.The responsibility of the international community to promote human rights and remove threats to peace is nowhere heavier than in the case of South Africa. The Somali Government welcomes the increasing application of measures which demonstrate the world community's abhorrence of the policies of apartheid pursued by the Pretoria regime. Regrettably  however  the apartheid system remains essentially in place and  as recent events show  institutionalized oppression against the majority of the population and against all those who oppose apartheid continues unabated. Member States must undertake concerted global action to ensure the complete eradication of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic society in a united  democratic South Africa.In the event that the Pretoria regime should continue its policy of internal repression and external aggression the Security Council should take immediate action in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and impose comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against the racist South African regime. On Afghanistan  Somalia has always looked forward to an early settlement of the conflict in that war-torn territory. We were heartened by the agreements reached by the concerned parties in Afghanistan last year. The phased withdrawal of foreign troops also heightened expectations for an early resolution of the conflict. However  we are deeply dismayed that the situation in Afghanistan is not yet resolved and the incessant suffering of the Afghan people continues seriously to affect peace and stability in the region. We urge all parties concerned to undertake every effort in the search for a peaceful settlement of their differences on the basis of full and consistent implementation of the Geneva Agreements.On the question of Cyprus  we would like to emphasize the need for dialogue and inter-communal talks which are the only way to reach a just solution by peaceful means. We commend the Secretary-General  whose patient efforts to promote a negotiated settlement have been a major factor in the search for an end to the conflict. We are heartened by the recent meetings conducted at the highest level between the concerned parties  which we consider a positive step forward. We urge the Secretary-General to continue with his mission of good offices and appeal to all parties involved to co-operate fully with him in a constructive spirit to find a just and lasting solution  taking into account the fundamental rights of both communities.Somalia firmly believes that the conflict in Cambodia should be settled by peaceful means on the basis of the withdrawal of all foreign forces there from  and by ensuring the right of the people of Cambodia freely to determine their destiny without outside interference. While the recently held Paris Conference on Cambodia did not fully translate the expectations of the world community into reality  we trust that all parties involved will continue to exert their influence towards an early resolution of the conflict.On the question of Korea  my Government supports the peaceful reunification of the Korean people. We hope that the contacts that have taken place between the representatives of the parties concerned will bring about greater understanding and create the necessary conditions for a peaceful resolution of this long-standing problem. In conformity with the principle of universality  which is a fundamental feature of the United Nations  we support the aspiration of the Korean people for membership in the United Nations in order to contribute to the furtherance of international peace  security and co-operation.As the world enters the third millennium  we  the family of nations  have no option but to face the challenges of the contemporary world. The need of the hour is for fresh and bold action. We must undertake concerted efforts towards a better and nobler life for all of our peoples. Collectively  the nations of the world have enough resources to underwrite our endeavours. The human genius and potentials  which are almost without limit  can provide us with newer and imaginative options at every stage of our journey towards a better world and a meaningful common future. Only if we choose to pursue the path of mutual understanding and co-operation can our collective efforts succeed. I most sincerely hope that we make the right choice at the right time  and the time is now."
"128",6408,"STP",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe  and on my own behalf  I have the honour and pleasure to extend to the President our warmest congratulations on his election to preside over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election is recognition at the international level of his high competence and wide experience as a diplomat and a statesman. It is also testimony to the international community high appreciation of his country  Nigeria  which plays an outstanding role on the African continent in the economic and political spheres. I assure him that my delegation considers it an absolute duty to give its complete support to that outstanding son of Africa in the important mission that has rightly been entrusted to him.May I take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  on his outstanding performance in presiding over the forty-third session  whose highly satisfactory and positive results can in part be attributed to his dedication and commitment to the ideals of the United Nations.Allow me also to express my admiration and respect for the dynamic and dedicated work undertaken by our Organization's Secretary-General. His activities have made more effective the actions taken b/ the United Nations  actions which have been contributed to the present strengthening of  its credibility and its role at the multilateral level. The Secretary-General should be praised for his far-sightedness  his constant efforts and the courage with which he has been seeking solutions to some of the regional conflicts affecting the world.We should work towards the objective of transforming the United Nations into a privileged place for multilateral analysis at the political level of the crucial questions confronting the world and mankind. An important and decisive change creating favourable conditions for the realization of the potential of the United Nations is the fact that the great Powers now agree on revitalizing the Organization  which they had underrated for so long. They recognize that the United Nations is an indispensable instrument in the creation of a peaceful and secure world and in the development of international co-operation embracing all peoples and nations in the search for solutions to the problems of the world and its inhabitants.Peace is the necessary condition for the development of a nation's well being. Without peace  all efforts to increase the material and spiritual well being of men will be in vain.In the past three years we have travelled a very promising path in that regard. There has been a deep and positive transformation of the international situation. At the basis of that evolution lies the relaxation in relations between the two super-Powers  relations which have gone from a long confrontation and cold war to the attitude of co-operation and understanding that characterizes their relations today. This detente does not seem to have the purely cyclical character that detente had before; we believe that it results from a rational approach to the differences between the two main systems in the world.We can only come to the unquestionable conclusion that the two rival socio-political systems cannot compete by force of arms in this nuclear era  for that would inexorably lead to the annihilation of the human race. Secondly  as a result of the uncontrolled nuclear and conventional arms race  the political tensions between the two political and military world blocs were compromising the future and the economic balance of the Soviet Union  the United States and the International community as a whole. Thanks to an awareness of that reality and an understanding of it  a new political and military mentality has begun to gain strength at the international level and to condition the behaviour of several countries in foreign policy  thus making it more and more feasible to have truly peaceful coexistence based on the principles of humanized law - that is  giving priority to universal human values  as opposed to mere ideology.The first concrete results of that trend are evidenced in the progress achieved in disarmament and in the emphasis being placed on the peaceful solution of regional conflicts.International security and the Individual security of States cannot be strengthened through accumulation of arms; on the contrary  that can only bring greater insecurity and tension  inevitably leading to a war-like confrontation. Only the reduction of arms in a spirit of trust and multiform co-operation between States can safeguard peace  which is priceless for mankind.The signing in Washington in December 1987 of the agreement on the dismantling of medium- and short-range nuclear missiles was an event of extraordinary historic importance  as a turning-point in prospects of disarmament  which people from all nations want to see in the form of general and complete disarmament  and the emergence of a peaceful world that will use available human and material resources for the development and happiness of mankind.Measures have been taken that reveal the political desire of the two super-Powers to move towards the disarmament process. We are hopeful that the so-called Jackson Hole spirit will give an impulse to the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START)  the Conference in Geneva and the Vienna talks. But we should be aware that nuclear  chemical and conventional disarmament does not depend only on the super-Powers  and that it will not succeed without the participation of all countries.We know that we cannot really blame foreign Powers for the bloody ethnic  religious  territorial and political national and international conflicts that engulf third world countries.It is scandalous that while 30 per cent of the people of Africa  Asia and the Middle East are affected by numerous diseases  or are undernourished  and have a very high illiteracy rate  there are countries that spend 20 per cent of their budgets on armaments  which is much more than they spend on health and education combined.The improvement in the world-wide political environment is evident. In this regard  it has been possible to obtain some concrete results in the search for peaceful solutions to regional conflicts  even though barriers have been encountered with regard to some cases that started well. Those conflicts constitute an obstacle to the economic and social development efforts of several developing countries  dangerously upset international relations and cause suffering  misery and hunger.The use of United Nations principles and mechanisms was decisive in the progress achieved during the process leading to a peaceful solution of some conflicts.Sao Tome and Principe  despite its modest means as a small State  participates in the efforts of the international community to suppress those focal points of tension. Above all  it has played an active role in the efforts to achieve peace in Angola. President Manuel Pinto da Costa was part of a group of eight Heads of State who met in Luanda. He contributed to the analysis and adoption of the peace plan presented by the People's Republic of Angola. That country's Government adopting a courageous and wise attitude  agreed to specific prospects for national reconciliation and the establishment of peace  aware as it was of the martyrdom of its people through almost three decades of war.A fair and lasting solution was imminent with the approval of the Luanda peace plan at the Summit of 18 Heads of State in Gbadolite  based on the African experience in the solution of similar cases. But external interference caused by foreign interests hostile to the people's cause created some difficulties in the implementation of the obligations then assumed.However we will continue to work towards an African solution to this painful conflict so that the People's Republic of Angola will finally be able to achieve progress and happiness for its people. We are confident that the process that has been started will proceed until peace is achieved.Namibia  a neighbouring country of the People's Republic of Angola  from which it received wide support that led to the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  will shortly accede to independence.No attempt at sabotage will prevent the Namibian people from finally achieving the objectives for which it fought for so many years. We believe that the South West Africa People's Organization  with the popular support it enjoys  will with pragmatism and realism recognize the aspirations of the Namibian people.Namibia's independence day will be a historic day for the entire continent. It will mark the end of the dreadful colonial era in Africa. Unfortunately  the day on which the African people will be able to rid its continent of that open wound  that crime against humanity in South Africa called apartheid  is distant and hard to reach. Despite the very open and promising declarations favouring positive change made by President de Klerk  the international community must continue to pressure South Africa politically  economically and morally because apartheid cannot just undergo some adjustments; apartheid is not reformable: it has to be completely abolished.If South Africa wishes to initiate a dialogue with South African nationalists for the construction of a democratic and multiracial society  it should immediately free Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners  cancel interdictions of the African National Congress of South Africa and all other nationalist parties and anti-apartheid organizations and put an end to the state of emergency.Still addressing the southern African zone-full of economic potential that must await peace and co-operation among all to be profitable - we will firmly support the wise and patriotic decisions of our Mozambican brothers of FRELÄª40  whose aim is to promote national reconciliation and achieve peace through dialogue with their misguided fellow countrymen.Still regarding the conflicts on the African continent  we welcome the signing on 31 August of the Algerian agreement  which has practically put an end to the Chad-Libya differences in the Aouzou zone  keeping away the spectre of renewed armed confrontation among brotherly peoples.In Western Sahara  we hope that flexibility will prevail and that it soon be possible to overcome any obstacles that may emerge regarding the carrying out of the  referendum  for the self-determination of the Saharan people on which interested parties are in accord.The problem between Senegal and Mauritania was traumatic for all Africans owing to the historical and cultural ties that unite those two neighbouring countries and the nature of the conflict. As always we can rely on the far-sightedness of intervention by President Mubarak for a fait solution of the situation and renewal of harmony between all Senegalese and Mauritanians.In the Middle East  the position of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO) at a meeting of the Palestine National Council  held in Algeria in November 1988  opened wide perspectives  created a new emphasis and stimulated new proposals for the solution of the conflict so that the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence can be finally recognized and all people in the region may live in peace and safety within internationally recognized and guaranteed borders. There is near-unanimity within the international community regarding the necessity to consider further steps leading to an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations that will reunite all interested parties  including the PLO  the sole and legal representative of the Palestinian people.We regret that Iran and Iraq  two countries that belong to the Non-Aligned Movement  after a long and cruel war with heavy human and economic losses  cannot overcome their differences and obstacles to the replacement of confrontation and disagreement with co-operation and solidarity.The situation in Afghanistan and Cambodia changed qualitatively from the moment the foreign troops left  but to achieve peace it is necessary that internal factions resist the temptation to use force and that they engage in dialogue for the creation of Governments that will represent all political forces without foreign interference.In Central America  the recent Tela summit  heir to the spirit of Esquipulas II  created solid bases for positive evolution and offered a foretaste of the democracy and peace for which the region yearns.Notwithstanding hopes regarding the process of eliminating regional tensions  we know we are still far from living in a peaceful and violence-free world in which the interests of every country and people are taken into consideration.We in Sao Tome and Principe are increasingly concerned about the occupation of East Timor  which makes it impossible for its people to enjoy its legal right to self-determination. We give our support to Portugal as the administering Power in its commendable efforts to find a fair solution to this matter through dialogue with Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General  within the framework of the mandate given to him by the General Assembly in resolution 37/30.Experts of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development recently announced their conviction  based on analysis of investment  inflation and other data  that the industrialised world has entered a new time of growth similar to that of the 1950s and 1960s.This has made more apparent and shocking the paradox of the economic situation prevailing in third world countries - and particularly in Africa - which is characterized by a deep and infrastructural crisis. The world previously faced a serious threat from the cold war and the confrontation between the blocs  which could have brought about the nuclear extermination of the whole human race. Even if we have escaped this nightmare with the relaxation of tension between East and West  there remains another threat resulting from the widening economic gap between North and South  the conflict between rich and poor.Industrialized countries are beginning to understand that this problem should be treated as a global problem affecting all mankind. In fact the international division of labour gives raw material producers little reason for hope in their development efforts  which are paralysed by the accumulation of external debt.With falling prices of raw materials in the 1980s foreign trade ceased to be a tool for the economic development of our countries. In Sao Tome and Principe we are now living with a serious economic and financial crisis caused by the abrupt fall in the price of our only export product  cocoa. Today  our partners in the North have come to the conclusion that it is unrealistic to insist on total payment of the debt and that it is necessary to reduce or in some cases cancel it. We express our satisfaction at the steps already taken by some industrialized countries. Only by facilitating new capital flows on advantageous terms for poor countries and promoting a reorganization of International economic relations will it be possible to avoid an uncontrollable increase of the debt.The events that will take place next year ~ that is  the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  the adoption of the United Nations international strategy for development and the second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries - should make a significant contribution to this necessary reorganization. The establishment of a more favourable international environment for third world countries will enable them to promote rational utilization of their resources and to adopt modern administrative methods. Above all  since development is essentially a cultural phenomenon which requires the active and free participation of a conscious citizenry  we must fight for the general establishment of democratic Governments that will allow freedom to criticize and the development of the creativity of our people  which is a sine qua non of true development.In a world of positive political change and phenomenal developments in technology and science which create prospects for a better future for mankind there remain  unfortunately  factors of apprehension and regression.The illegal consumption of and traffic in drugs causes serious and complex human  social and political problems. The events in Colombia have shown how far the illegal traffic in drugs and the economic power connected with it can put at risk the democratic and constitutional order of a country. Since this is a phenomenon whose tentacles spread to many places in the world  international co-operation is indispensable if the police ace to struggle effectively against this scourge. But the deepest and greatest task will be to try by scientific and multi-disciplinary means to identify and destroy the psychological and social roots of this scourge that leads millions of men and women  mostly young adults  to self-destruction through the consumption of drugs.terrorism is an irrational form of behaviour in a world that is marching towards the rationalization of its problem  Terrorism constitutes a threat to all countries in the world and the General Assembly  in resolution 40/61  has clearly condemned this Inhuman practice. All members of the International community must co-ordinate their actions in the fight against terrorism and comply with existing anti-terrorist conventions and protocols. No cause can justify the murder of totally innocent men# women end children who have nothing whatsoever to do with these conflicts. No lofty purpose can be achieved through the use of these inhuman means.Another painful concern of our times is the constant and progressive degradation of our environment# which puts at risk the future of our planet. This is one of the global problems that can be tackled only by means of international co-operation. In this connection# the conference Ñ environment and development which it is proposed should be convened in 1992 would play a very important role.We cannot forget that the causes of environmental degradation are different in the North and the South and thus require different remedies. In the majority of the countries of the South there is an extremely disturbing element of disruption of the balance between man and the environment. It is the frequent disproportion between the growing population and the availability of natural resources.The bicentenary of the French Revolution of 1739  commemorated this year# has always been more than a purely French historic event. The greatest inheritance left by this event to people all over the world was the new idea of an open society  with the abolition of caste and privilege and the confirmation of the rights of men and citizens. It was then that the concept of people as the principal actors in political events began to assume full relevance. The Belgrade declaration last month emphasized the urgent necessity of promoting the rights and freedoms of man and respect for the life  dignity and ideas of individuals.Contrary to theories that have been expressed# we believe that the major rights of citizens are political rights because only those tights can lead to the enjoyment of other rights. In Sao Tome and Principe  although adequate conditions institutions and mechanisms have not yet been established  we have been taking important measures since our party's decision in October 1987 for the purpose of deepening the democratic process in our country. In the party in power - which is still the only political organization that we have  because of our historical context  but within which we allow for the existence of different currents of thought - and in our society  we have totally and fully guaranteed freedom of expression. In 1990 an electoral and constitutional decision package will crystallize this process.In conclusion  I should like to emphasize in this United Nations forum in which all the countries of the world  large and small  coexist  our trust and faith in an international community which is increasingly peaceful and economically  socially and spiritually more advanced.It is my sincere hope that our work at this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly will contribute to the attainment of this objective.

"129",6441,"SUR",44,1989,"ï»¿ Like many other countries in the developing world  Suriname has been confronted in this decade with falling prices of our main commodities  with difficulties in penetrating the markets of the industrialized nations  with obstacles to creating a solid democratic society  and  moreover  with the benign but distant interest of some of our developed sister nations in the difficult process of underpinning the political changes taking place in our country with the security of provision for the basic needs of the people.We must admit  however  that while these experiences have had a negative impact on the steady pursuance of our development objectives  they have at the same time strengthened our determination to meet the challenges that face us and to redouble our efforts to achieve the goals we set for ourselves years ago. For that reason we have once again come to New York with great pleasure  to share with you our experiences and be part of the new  emerging political understanding between and within independent nations.Before doing so  however  I wish to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers and congratulate you. Sir  on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am pleased to see a representative of the African continent  with its ongoing historical political development  in the presidency of this session of the General Assembly. Africa  with its great diversity and economic possibilities  can play a decisive role in shaping the new  emerging political relations and co-operation in our world. It is also fitting  indeed  that a son of our brother country Nigeria  with which Suriname has historical ties  has been chosen  since that country has served as an example because of its contribution to unity and integrative in Africa  and to international co-operation and peaceful coexistence. Your experience and diplomatic skills  demonstrated as Chairman of the Special Committee against apartheid  justify our sincere expectation that under your leadership this session of the General Assembly will come to a successful conclusion.We should also like to express our profound appreciation to the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Argentina  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the distinctive and able manner in which he guided the affairs of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. We wish him well in his future endeavours. Likewise  we should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his personal contributions to the search for peace  security and stability in the world. His tireless efforts to strengthen the Organization and to achieve solutions to the numerous conflicts threatening international peace and security  as well as his dedication to the cause of sustained development in the developing countries  is well known and deserves our gratitude.Concerning Suriname  it is with a feeling of pride and satisfaction that I can announce that our Government has succeeded in gratifying the cherished wish of the majority of the people of Suriname by actively starting the termination of the internal armed conflict. This fight in which brother took up arms against brother had been going on for years. Convinced that combating violence by violence would not bring peace and prosperity to our people  we opted for the road of dialogue and consensus. This road recently led to the conclusion of the peace agreement of Kourou  which in turn set off a genuine peace process and brought an end to the meaningless bloodshed  the victims of which were mostly innocent people.We are aware that we have only just begun and that we shall certainly encounter many obstacles on our path. But  armed with reason  humanity  friendship and solidarity - qualities for which our people are noted - we shall overcome those impediments. Today  a new  important step forward is being taken in the peace process and the process of dialogue and consensus. The peace agreement has already resulted in the abolition of the state of emergency in the eastern part of the country. Because of this  real prospects for the safe and speedy return of thousands of  refugees to their homelands have been created  through the contributions of international agencies as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are indispensable  and we are indeed grateful for the assistance they are rendering.At this juncture  I should like to express my Government's appreciation for the activities of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with regard to the problems of refugees  and uprooted and displaced persons in general. We therefore applaud the Guatemala Declaration and the Complementary Plan of Concerted Action  which were adopted at the first International Conference on Central American Refugees  as important steps in the right direction.Now we  the Government and people of Suriname  are once again in a position to fulfil out internationally agreed obligations towards our countrymen in the eastern part of our country. Once again these fellow-citizens of ours will be able to make use of the political  social and economic rights they ate entitled to.The last phase of our democratisation process has thus started and  hopefully  peace and stability will soon once more characterize our Surinamese society. Without united efforts  we shall then be able to work for the economic  social and political reconstruction of the country as a whole. Because of the peace agreement  our people are able to dream again  to dream of a new horizon  of a future of genuine peace and prosperity which they can make come true through their own efforts.I am also happy to be able to observe that positive developments have taken place in the formerly strained relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Suriname. We express the fervent hope that these developments will be expanded  strengthened and consolidated  to the mutual benefit of both nations. Allow me at this time to present in brief our position on a selected number of international issues. After years of effort and persistence and through the tireless and patient exercise of the good offices of the Secretary-General  significant progress may be observed in the field of international relations.It is indeed with satisfaction that we are witnessing that the practice of detente has been reborn and that a new style and new attitude have emerged in the conduct of international relations} that new approach  whereby confrontation has been replaced by dialogue and understanding  has already resulted in negotiated solutions to some regional conflicts which had hitherto seemed unsolvable.The Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - and their ongoing discussions regarding other matters of great importance to international peace and security the agreement between Iran and Iraq the Geneva Agreements with regard to Afghanistan and Pakistan; the scheduled independence of Namibia; and the recent agreement on the Central American conflict are all good examples of the lessening of political tensions in the world.These developments augur well for the future of our planet and although we should not expect that conflicts which have lasted for years and have deep-rooted causes will immediately be settled  I feel obliged to urge the parties concerned to respect the agreements  d to refrain from tactics and measures which could delay or even stifle the peace process.I especially refer to the recalcitrant attitude of the apartheid regime of South Africa  which continues with killings and harassment of the Namibian people notwithstanding the peace agreements signed in December 1988. My Government condemns the involvement of both the military and civilian authorities of the apartheid regime  which intimidates and victimizes the Namibians  obstructing them in the exercise of their legitimate right to elect a Government of their own choice.At the same time it is encouraging to note that the countries of Central America have demonstrated their firm political will to reject the use of force and to restore a climate of trust and tranquillity in their region. The agreement recently reached has highlighted the profound desire for peace of the Central American peoples and their commitment to negotiation and to dialogue to resolve long-existing conflicts  and thus deserves the full support of the international community.In spite of the positive trends of accommodation and detente  some hard cotes of suppression and conflict still persist. In spite of continuous condemnation by the international community the apartheid regime of South Africa continues its policies of discrimination  detention and suppression of the majority of its people.Events of recent months have brought no comfort to those who hoped to see the apartheid system dismantled. Only when this institutionalised racism is totally eradicated will peace and security be assured in this part of the world.The situation in the Middle East continues to be unstable and dangerous. The question of Palestine remains the core of the Middle East problem and the prime example of disregard of United Nations resolutions and of the will of the international community. My government deplores the deterioration of the situation in the occupied territories and the constant increase in the number of Palestinians slain or wounded. We believe that only an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  and with the participation of all parties concerned  will be able to establish a viable  negotiated framework to address all the dimensions of the conflict and being hope for restoring peace and security to the region. In this respect we welcome the efforts of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt as an opportunity to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process. I sincerely hope that mankind will soon witness progress and tangible results in the form of a lessening of tension and confrontation in regional conflicts.Regarding the Kampuchean problem  my delegation is of the view that a just and durable peace in Kampuchea can be reached only through a comprehensive political settlement  one which takes into account the interests and aspirations of the people of that nation.As I said before  my Government believes in dialogue and in this sense we welcome the resumption of contacts in the Korean peninsula. Even though no concrete advance has as yet been noted  we hope that the dialogue with a view to the ramification of the two Koreas will be intensified and that the proposals of 11 September 1989 by President Roh Tae Woo may serve as a basis.Although we have made optimistic observations with regard to changes in the international political arena we note with disappointment that international economic prospects remain uncertain. Slow or negative growth and the persisting debt problem are causing further deterioration of the quality of life in the <1evelÃ¶ping countries. Never has the situation of the developing countries been more adversely affected than during the past decade.Governments of developing countries have instituted courageous reforms in order to revitalize their economies  but their experience has been that economic adjustment programmes have been disproportionately heavy and have had very severe social and political consequences for them. Their experience has been that without massive external support the successful and positive influence of economic growth and development will remain illusory. As a consequence of these developments the economic disparities between industrialized and developing countries have widened.About 40 years ago it seemed as though the international community had learned a valuable lesson from the enormous tragedies of the 1930Ð·. Much to our regret  however  we must observe that the present outlook is proof to the contrary. The style of dialogue and the understanding which have characterized international political relations during the last few years and which have resulted in many negotiated agreements  have unfortunately not yet trickled through to international economic relations. On the contrary  we notice an approach which does not recognize the needs of developing countries and does not assist them to lift themselves out of their poverty and modern development.There is a lack of political will to consider comprehensive measures which take into account the new realities and changing circumstances in the international economic environment. These measures should include development objectives such as poverty reduction  long-term solutions to foreign debt  development financing  and reactivation of the international economy. Such comprehensive measures should also include redefining international economic relations  removing the structural imbalances in the international economic system and preventing the further widening of the economic and technological gap between industrialized and developing countries.I should like to stress that the lofty goal of a more just and equitable distribution of the world's riches can be reached only if multilateral co-operation for economic and social development is revitalized and strengthened. We are not asking for pity or mere sympathy but for new economic conditions which recognize our needs and help to ensure that we  the developing countries  can lift ourselves out of our poverty and underdevelopment. We therefore urge our developed partners to show their political readiness to widen the field of multilateral economic understanding during the preparations for the fourth international development strategy and during the special session on international economic co-operation. Shortly after the independence of Suriname the Surinamese Government participated actively  as a member of the Ad  Hoc Committee  in the preparation of the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages  which was adopted by the General Assembly in 1979 and which has been in force since June 1983. Despite the setbacks of recent years  in which hostage killing was added to the chapter of human suffering  my Government remains confident that the convention against the taking of hostages and other relevant instruments will serve the purpose for which they were created. My delegation is of the view that murder and terrorism cannot be condoned under any circumstances.Suriname has since its inception been a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Drafting of an International Convention against the Recruitment  Use  Financing and Training of Mercenaries. Ten years ago  this matter was placed on the agenda of the General Assembly for the first time. The Ad Hoc Committee has made tangible progress since then  as reflected in its successive reports  but  because of certain conflicts of interest  the badly needed convention is still pending. Meanwhile  the activities of mercenaries continue to create a devastating atmosphere in many developing countries. The Special Rapporteur on Mercenaries has repeatedly drawn the attention of the world community to the subversive practices of mercenaries. An adequate convention  together with concerted international actions directed towards combating the phenomenon of mercenaries  will have a tremendous impact on the eradication of this evil. It is for these reasons that our Government expresses the hope that the General Assembly will be in a position to finalize the drafting of the desired international convention at the earliest possible date.During the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament  it was recognized that the cessation of nuclear-weapon testing would be an important contribution to the goal of ending the qualitative improvement of these weapons and the development of new types  and prevention of their proliferation. Despite the General Assembly's insistence in later years  this goal has not been reached  although we have to admit that recently some progress has been made. In this light  we welcome the reduction of tensions in East-West relations  since this provides the basis for more effective action in freezing nuclear-weapon production and subsequently dismantling nuclear weapons. However  given the importance of such action for the survival of mankind  we feel that discussions aimed at achieving complete nuclear disarmament should not be merely bilateral  but a multilateral undertaking. A multilateral approach will more successfully guarantee that the interests of the whole of mankind are served   d that the resources derived from disarmament will be used for economic and social development.My Government shares the view that nuclear-weapon-free zones are an essential contribution to the promotion of peace and stability. We therefore call upon all States to co-operate in the establishment of such zones. As a party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco  we appeal to the States which have not yet done so to join ranks and try to keep the Latin American and Caribbean region nuclear-weapon free.Furthermore we wish to stress that disarmament in the field of conventional and chemical weapons should not be neglected. It has been reported  at the Conference on Disarmament during its Geneva session in the summer of this year  that about 20 countries still have arsenals full of chemical weapons. These horrific means of mass destruction should undoubtedly be eliminated. It is high time that a chemical weapons ban treaty with a very tight verification system be concluded under the auspices of the United Nations.The drug problem is doubtless one of the most serious universal concerns of today. It is not merely a problem that undermines out economies and endangers the physical health of our peoples) recent developments in our regime demonstrate that the abuse of and illicit traffic in drugs and psychotropic substances also increasingly threaten the social and political stability of our countries. We have witnessed the developments in this context in one of our sister countries in the Western Hemisphere. We firmly support that country's Government in its efforts to combat the organized drugs mafia and its severe negative social  economic and political impact. Because of the international dimensions of this problem  my Government underlines the need for intensive regional  interregional and international co-operation in order effectively to deal with this plague of mankind. In this connexion  we welcome the recent initiatives of Governments in our region. We are of the opinion that these initiatives deserve the fullest support of the international community. We furthermore believe that the relevant United Nation s agencies and the other international and regional institutions involved should be encouraged in their endeavours  and that financial resources must be committed to assist them in their battle to eradicate the scourge of narcotic drugs.As time goes by  we notice that our planet is no longer the same safe haven for mankind if; used to be. The international community recognizes more and more that environmental issues such as climate changes  the conversion of fertile land into desert  the depletion of freshwater resources and the disposal of hazardous chemicals are jeopardizing our ecological systems as well as the most vital interests of mankind. Although environmental problems have grave effects on the development of third world countries in particular these problems should have the attention of the international community as a whole. Given the vital and urgent global character of our environment  a multilateral approach is required to tackle these environmental problems in all their aspects  and the contributions and co-operation of the industrialized nations are indispensable and of major importance. My delegation therefore looks forward to the convening in 1992 of the United Nations conference on environment and development  which we hope will be held on our continent.It is essential that measures in this context take note of the necessity of eliminating or reducing the imbalance in international production and consumption patterns. One of the major malpractices against the environment that should strongly be rejected is the dumping of nuclear waste and hazardous chemicals by industrialized countries in developing countries  a practice experienced by the latter as abuse of their unfavourable economic situation.The Amazon countries  to which Suriname belongs  have adopted a declaration in which  inter alia  they express their firm intention to widen and strengthen the mechanisms for co-operation committed to the protection of the environment in the Amazon region. We are fully aware of the region's importance to the world  and we are capable and responsible enough to protect it.I have tried to stand up in plain view and make what I hope has been a clear  forthright statement of out position  because I wanted the Assembly to know exactly where our country stands  what it advocates  and what it believes. It is true that in our efforts to obtain our cherished goals  we  the United Nations  have lost some ground. We have not been spared certain disappointments and unpleasant surprises. At the same time  however  we have learned by experience. We have learned that peace  development and prosperity are not to be had by merely asking. Like other great ideals  they can only be obtained through hard and consistent effort.As we stand on the threshold of the 1990s  I am pleased to observe that today's developments in world affairs give us cause for a certain optimism for the future  a future in which our ever more indivisible and interdependent world beholds a new horizon  a horizon holding out the promise of peace  development and prosperity for all. Let us  then  proceed to examine specific ways and means to make the goals and end results we seek possible. It is our profound hope and expectation that our Organization will have a vital role to play in this coming new era. "
"130",6535,"SWE",44,1989,"ï»¿The recent successes of the United Nations towards the settlement of several regional conflicts have added new dimensions to the concept of collective responsibility and security. The general improvement in East-west relations paved the way for those positive developments. It is also clear that an important factor has been patient and quiet diplomacy under United Nations auspices. Yet we must be aware of the dangers of complacency. So long as war and conflict are still a reality in many parts of the world  the United Nations has an obligation to continue to press for peaceful solutions based on the principles of international law. Peace-keeping  peace-making and peace-building are the tools the United Nations uses in its task of serving peace: United Nations peace-keeping activities help conflicting parties avoid continued violence  united Nations peace-making efforts help conflicting parties reach lasting solutions. United Nations peace-building helps create conditions which may remove causes of war and conflict altogether.The task of peace-building involves formidable challenges: we must take action to eradicate world poverty  we must tackle the debilitating debt problem  we must fight disease and rampant drug abuse  and we must rapidly reverse the trend of environmental destruction which fatally threatens our planet and the future of our children. Together with preventing nuclear war  that is the most pressing challenge. Catastrophe is closing in on us as we cross environmental thresholds which should never have been approached. Unless we now act collectively and decisively we shall all march into a poisoned wasteland. Europe  the classic focus of great-Power confrontation  has started to move towards political dialogue  arms reduction and peaceful co-operation. Today we dare to believe that the long period known as the cold war is now history and that a new period has begun  offering new opportunities for mankind.The changes we are witnessing in the Soviet Union and in some other East European countries  particularly Poland and Hungary  are truly promising. This is what so many Europeans have been waiting for  for so many years. Following the elections in Poland a new coalition Government headed by Solidarity has taken office. This is a milestone in European postâWar history  These changes constitute a main element in the improvement of relations between the super-Powers and among European States. Also  the new Soviet attitude towards the United Nations has invigorated the world Organization.The improved East-West climate has had important positive effects in removing much of the sharp edge of great-Power rivalry from regional conflicts. It is in this situation that the United Nations has proved as never before its value as an important for peace-making as well as for peace-keeping.Peace-keeping and peace-making are closely interrelated. The number and value of United Nations peace-keeping activities have never been greater. The Nobel peace Prize for 1988 was awarded to the thousands of men and women who have valiantly served in United Nations peace-keeping operations since the 1950s.In peace-making the United Nations has taken a decisive role in regions long torn by armed conflict  but also more and more in preventing conflicts from erupting into open warfare. The critical factor for the success of such efforts is a Security Council capable of reaching operative decisions. Also  when the Council gives directives to the Secretary-General they must be backed by continued political and material support.a large and complex United Nations operation is currently under way in Namibia. Sweden fully supports the Security Council  the Secretary-General and the Secretary-General's Special Representative in their efforts to ensure the independence of Namibia through free and fair elections under the supervision and control of the United Nations. We greatly look forward to welcoming Namibia into the community of sovereign nations.The system of apartheid is at the root of conflicts not only in south Africa but in the region as a whole. Apartheid is a threat to international peace and security  it is also an affront to human dignity. Apartheid must go  and it will go. Until then international pressure on South Africa must be increased. We shall continue to work for effective sanctions against South Africa. The special session of the General Assembly on apartheid must lead to further pressure on South Africa to enter into real negotiations. The comprehensive peace plan adopted by the Organization of African Unity should be supported by all of us. Now is the time for the South African Government to free Nelson Mandela and to recognize the true representatives of the majority of the people of South Africa.The Middle East is one region where peace not only has to be made and kept  but has to be built up from the ground. The United Nations is involved in Peace-keeping through the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine  the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  and in peace-making through the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council. Peace-building is being attempted by various United Nations agencies. Israel still defies the Palestinian people  its Arab neighbours  international law and world opinion by its continued occupation of Arab territories.The intifadah has cleared away any remaining doubts about the will of the Palestinian people to shape their own future. The PLO wishes to negotiate with Israel. At last year's General Assembly  I appealed to the Israeli Government to take the hand extended by the PLO and to show a similar willingness to negotiate. Both the Palestinians and Israel must recognize each other's rights. Both sides must renounce terror. And both sides must be willing to talk to each other. Openness and dialogue is the enemy of mistrust and fear  as President Bush stated yesterday. Now is the time to start a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians. Through active and constructive efforts  in particular by Egypt  a crucial new step could now be taken on the road to a durable and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Negotiations through an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of all parties directly concerned  including the PLO  remain the best avenue ahead. The negotiations should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of the United Nations Security Council and on the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  full self-determination.Sweden welcomes the cease-fire in Lebanon achieved through the efforts of the Arab League. All parties must now co-operate to reach a political solution. Withdrawal of foreign troops and an end to foreign interference is long overdue. The United Nations played a key peace-making role when the Geneva agreements on Afghanistan were negotiated through the good offices of the world Organization. The agreements raised hopes for a political settlement  hopes which have yet to materialize. It is deeply tragic that the agreements and the improved East-West climate have not meant the end of the war in Afghanistan. Attempts to reach a military solution  sustained by continued arms deliveries  will only result in  further suffering for the Afghan people. The Security Council now has to face up to its responsibilities and ensure a viable peace process. The Security Council has demonstrated its capacity for effective leadership in bringing the fighting between Iran and Iraq to an end. But its resolution 598 (1987) needs to be fully implemented in order to avoid a new flare-up of violence and to bring peace and stability to the area. Sweden strongly supports the Secretary-General and his personal representative in their efforts to achieve these results.Sweden welcomes the withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. The deep-seated internal conflict must not  however  be allowed to lead to even more bloodshed. The international community has a responsibility to ensure that the reign of terror does not return. The difficulties demonstrated at the Paris Conference must be overcome and no effort spared to reach a negotiated solution.The gradually increasing role of the United Nations in Central America through its three innovative missions opens new possibilities for a successful peace process. I am confident that all States outside Central America  and in particular those with special ties to the region  will solidly support the regional peace process and the Secretary-General in his efforts.All these activities  directly related to the maintenance of peace and security  are the collective responsibility of the Member States. This means that the assessments for peace-keeping  decided on by this Assembly  have to be paid by all Member States  in full and on time. The costs of keeping peace are indeed marginal to those of waging war. But making and keeping peace is not our only endeavour. Building peace goes beyond that. The roots of war and conflict are often to be found in unjust social and economic conditions. War and conflict always result in social and economic misery. War and conflict prevent the solution of social and economic problems. Social and economic conditions must be improved everywhere on a sound  sustainable basis.A particularly pressing problem is the debt burden of the third world. Some progress has been made. But the third world debt still amounts to more than SUS 1 000 billion. This constitutes a destabilizing force not only in developing countries but also in the world economy.Threats to the global environment are increasingly perceived to be no less serious than the threat of destruction by war. International co-operation to safeguard the environment and to promote sustainable developments in all countries must be central to the peace-building efforts of the United Nations.Through the interaction of poverty and injustice with environmental stress  vast numbers of men  women and children have been forced to leave their degraded and destroyed home areas. Political instability  even international conflicts  could be the result as such migrations become more common and involve even greater numbers of environmental refugees. Concern for the environment must be integrated into our entire economic system in order to guarantee long-term survival and sustainable development. Therefore  the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development must lead to concrete action. With regard to the venue of the Conference  Sweden would find it most appropriate if this time it were held in a developing country. We welcome the consensus on Brazil's candidature reached at the summit meeting in Belgrade of the Non-Aligned Movement  it is vital that we now join together in laying the foundations for a truly successful Conference. Sweden intends to take an active part in the important preparatory process leading up to the Conference.The struggle to safeguard our environment must be pursued at many different levels. Like other countries in northern Europe  Sweden is threatened by the pollution of the Baltic Sea. When Sweden assists Poland in its fight against  pollution  we do this also to secure our own environment. We would like to extend this co-operation to the entire Baltic Sea region. Even if the risk of nuclear war appears less imminent than for many decades. the vast arsenals of nuclear weapons by their very existence constitute a threat to life on our planet. The arms race increases the risk of war. The resources diverted from productive uses to military purposes are of staggering proportions. There is a growing realisation in the world that true peace and security cannot be based on deterrence and fear. The kind of security that depends on ever Increasing armaments must be replaced by a concept of common security that is basically political and rests on mutual confidence.Promoting common security is a central element in the peace-building role of the united Nations. The negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament for a chemical weapons convention are complex  but I am convinced that they have now reached a stage where they can be successfully concluded if there is political .ill.The super-Powers have a special responsibility with regard to disarmament in general and nuclear disarmament in particular. For example  the practice of the nuclear Powers neither to confirm nor deny the existence of nuclear weapons on board their warships is out of date and confidence-blocking. We hope  and expect  that their new and better understanding in the field of security will soon put an end to this practice.Concern for human rights all over the world is very much a part of Peace-building. There is a wide discrepancy between the human rights standards subscribed to by Governments and the reality existing in many States. At the same time we are witnessing in many parts of the world the strength and vitality of popular faith in human rights and in democratic principles. This is true even when these rights and principles are violently suppressed  as they have sadly - not to use stronger words - have been in China and Burma this year. The United Nations provides a forum and machinery for holding Governments accountable to the international community for human rights violations. This platform must be used and extended.The Commission on Human Rights has transmitted to the General Assembly two important draft instruments on human rights. The first is the convention on the rights of the child. It would constitute an important step towards improving the situation of children all over the world. The second is the optional protocol on the abolition of the death penalty. Sweden fully supports the adoption of these two instruments at this session of the General Assembly.Peace-building through the United Nations involves a wide diversity of co-operative efforts. In one such area the challenges have recently been dramatically demonstrated in recent months and weeks. I am referring to the global problem of narcotic drugs  and in particular to the events in Colombia. These developments have demonstrated how closely the fight against narcotic drugs and terrorism is linked to peace and security. It is now high time for an international offensive against the scourge of narcotic drugs. An offensive can be made effective only through multilateral co-operation. Only the United Nations can provide suitable machinery for this urgent peace-building task. Sweden will propose at this session of the General Assembly the realization of a global programme of action against narcotic drugs.To meet new demands the United Nations must of course have adequate resources. The financial crisis of the United Nations is perhaps less acute  but it is not over. Budget reform has had positive effects and must be pursued. It is not acceptable that certain Member States owe the Organization a total exceeding half a billion dollars. Financial obligations under the Charter must be fully honoured  and when new or increased demands are placed on the United Nations we must all be prepared to accept the costs. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and veteran United Nations diplomat Ralph Bunche once said  ""if we in the United Nations could be as successful at peace-making as we are at peace-keeping  then our problems would be greatly reduced"". Today we have reason to be more optimistic about the United Nations peace-making role than Ralph Bunche could be. The united Nations is the primary forum where together we can meet the challenges of the future  the challenges of peace-building. This makes tremendous demands on the world Organization  on its Member States and on our solidarity with each other. We all know that in a happy and harmonious family all members show solidarity with each other  in the same way justice and progress in a nation cannot be achieved without solidarity among the citizens. The same principle applies to the world. Peace-building demands solidarity among nations."
"131",6573,"SWZ",44,1989,"ï»¿ May I start  Mr. President  by congratulating you most sincerely on your well-deserved election to the presidency of this  the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am confident that  with your outstanding diplomatic skills  proved experience and undoubted leadership abilities  the Assembly will meet the challenge of its global commitments. On a personal note  we Swazis are delighted that this vitally important job is in the hands of a fellow African  with whose country we have enjoyed excellent  long-standing relations.I wish also to register my appreciation for all that your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo  managed to achieve  while so ably guiding the proceedings of last year's session.You will be aware that this is my first opportunity to address the General assembly. No other Swazi King has had such an opportunity. I am very conscious  as I stand before you  of the 44 years of illustrious history belonging to fee United Nations. It is a history which has shown  time and again  that the Organization remains the most important multilateral institution for resolving international conflicts. I  Her Majesty the Indlovukazi  and the whole Swazi nation are proud to be identified wife such a history  and I can assure you of my determination to lend Swaziland's full support to the Organization's fundamental principles and guiding tenets. The promotion of international peace and security  through full respect for human rights and the dignity of all citizens  remains elemental to our goals and purposes. I therefore note with relief and satisfaction feat we meet against a backdrop of a relaxation in the relations between the two super-Powers. I applaud fee role played by fee United Nations  in this  and in all its efforts in multilateral diplomacy.Wife that in mind I should like at this point to pay tribute to our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The international community without question benefits from his outstanding devotion to duty and his boundless energy. His staff too deserve our gratitude. The specialized agencies  and particularly the United Nations peace-keeping forces throughout the world  continue to earn our gratitude and appreciation foe work well done in their mission for advancing the cause of human dignity and justice.I must express Swaziland's concern at renewed evidence of fee economic imbalance between North and South. The latest offering of the world Economic Survey of 1989 holds out very little hope to us in fee South of any improvement. As a result  Swaziland is an active member of the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) and fee preferential trade area. It is our aim to counter the imbalance by encouraging our economic community in eastern and southern Africa. Swaziland is a small  landlocked Kingdom. Our economic development depends on a healthy climate of international trade relations. An active regional economic community will provide essential markets and this  in turn  will encourage our producers to diversify and thus strengthen our agro-industrial base. I would welcome endorsement of this policy by our economic partners in development.I should like to turn my attention now to areas of conflict current in the world today.The problems in the Middle East continue to cause concern to the people of Swaziland. We sympathize with all involved and would appeal to all parties to exercise maximum restraint. We welcome the call for an international peace conference on the Middle East. We feel that participation should be on an equal footing  with no pre-conditions.Close to home  I should like to reassert Swaziland's unswerving commitment to the principles of non-racial democracy  non-alignment and complete respect for human dignity  justice and peaceful coexistence with all.We hope that the South African Government  under its new leadership  will respect the views and rightful expectations of all its citizens. We are encouraged by the new initiatives and can only hope that words are backed up by action.This time next month Namibia will have elected its first democratic Government. My country prays for a peaceful election process  free from outside pressure  whatever the outcome  we trust that the monitoring force of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) will ensure that it is the will of the majority that prevails. We look forward to welcoming Namibia to next year's Assembly session.En route to New York I paid a short visit to our neighbour Mozambique. During friendly and fruitful discussions I assured the President of my resolve to speak out clearly on his country's behalf. The continuing war affects Swaziland in many ways. The refugees fleeing the conflict are of particular concern to us  constituting at least 7 per cent of our total population. Fifty thousand refugees currently stretch our resources in land  finance and employment. While we are encouraged by the response of the international community as a whole  and of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in particular  we feel that the time has now come for the Assembly to give full attention to supporting the process started by President Chissano and carried on by Presidents Moi and Mugabe of Kenya and Zimbabwe  respectively. Let us give real assistance to the people of Mozambique and ease the alarming pattern of emigration  which is threatening to choke the countries playing reluctant host.Sadly  many other situations of conflict persist throughout the world. Swaziland would welcome the guidance of the Secretary-General and United Nations agencies for their future settlement. I refer to the ongoing situations in Afghanistan  Iran-Iraq  Kampuchea  the Korean peninsula  Western Sahara  New Caledonia  Cyprus  Latin America and Senegal-Mauritania. Our previous successes should spur us on to address today's problems.Swaziland was saddened to hear of events in Beijing earlier this year. We hope and pray that peace has returned to that city and that the spirit of youthful expression has not been entirely squashed.It is heartening to be able to share in the enthusiasm of the United Nations for environmental issues. I am impressed by the deep concern of several Member States  which are working within the United Nations system on this agenda. Swaziland is fully prepared to play its part in this vital programme of action. Issues such as deforestation and desertification have particular relevance for us. We support fully all proposals made by the Assembly for an international conference in 1992  to focus on environmental awareness.In conclusion  I should like to express my firm opinion that the United Nations continues to be the best hope for mankind. We the people of Swaziland are proud to be associated with this august Assembly. Our own policies are dictated by the realities of our situation  and cautious wisdom has always been the Swazi watchword. The Charter of the United Nations is one with which we identify most strongly. It is my privilege  then  on behalf of all the Swazi people  to pledge our continued co-operation with the United Nations system and its specialized agencies. God bless you all. "
"132",6607,"SYC",44,1989,"ï»¿It is a great honour for me to be addressing the Assembly today. It is my pleasant task  Mr. President  to offer you Seychelles' congratulations on your election  which is proof of the confidence all our delegations have in you. In selecting you  the General Assembly of the United Nations is paying a special tribute to Nigeria and  moreover  to Africa. I would also like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General for his devotion to his task and his tireless efforts in the service of peace and development.From its beginnings  the United Nations has played an essential role. Without dwelling on the results of its activities  we know that the United Nations has remained the only place where peaceful solutions have been sought ceaselessly. This aspiration and this perseverance alone proves that the United Nations is a symbol of all that is best in the international community. At its inception  the United Nations numbered only 50 States today  more than 40 years later  that number has more than tripled. Nevertheless  just as it did in the earliest days of its existence  the United Nations needs support  it needs a strengthening of that agreement to co-operate by all the States which share the legitimacy of its ideals. The preamble of its Charter  with the words  We the people of the United Nations ...    calls for just this attitude of mutual understanding.Because of co-operation by the international community  the world we see before us is one which is completely different from anything humanity experienced 50 and 100 years ago and more. In a world where coin tries are becoming more and more interdependent with every passing year  all the problems we face become universal ones.The quest the United Nations has led so arduously under the banner of understanding  detente and negotiating has beyond a doubt our enthusiasm and our energies towards a more just and balanced world. However  the task is not complete in the domains of peace and disarmament  indebtedness and famine and the environment and its protection.We must therefore adopt a positive strategy and as concrete resolutions as possible to meet the dangers which  unfortunately  are more than a mere threat. We can now affirm that what brings us closer together is much greater than what divides us. Over the past year the peoples of the world have made tireless efforts to defend peace and promote development. We can appreciate the positive results achieved through these efforts  and we are aware of the many achievements that have been made possible because of the United Nations. The climate of detente and peace must now be strengthened in all parts of the world  including the Indian Ocean region. It is in this spirit that we wish to express our hopes that military and nuclear arsenals will soon be dismantled. To do this it is imperative that all countries concerned  coastal or non-coastal  make the necessary efforts to bring about an early meeting of the International Conference on the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. We must all contribute to the achievement of the ultimate objective  that is to say  the elimination of nuclear weapons and  ultimately  total disarmament.All those who have begun to work to this end are to be thanked  as long as their activities are not illusory and the process is genuinely activated. Because what is at stake here is not just ethics or aesthetics but political issues in the noblest sense of the word.Indeed  how can we conceive of economic recovery on a global scale if it is to be translated into the destruction of the environment  natural resources and ecosystems  which are so fragile? We are quite rightly worried about the damage that is being inflicted more and more upon our planet and  about the threats to our future  whether it be a matter of the global warming  desertification  deforestation  or pollution of the waters or of the atmosphere or the transboundary movements of toxic wastes  the problems of the environment can be solved only at the world level. That is why considerable progress has been made very quickly in achieving international agreement on these questions in order to protect our planet for future generations  for the truth is that we live in an interdependent world. The problems of the environment in one country have immediate ramifications in neighbouring countries  and ultimately throughout the world. It is a problem common to us all  one that knows no political or ideological frontiers. We must act in concert.Never has man been so powerful - thanks to scientific and technological advances. Today  it is possible for him to correct the devastating errors of the past to use his knowledge for the sake of the environment; to try new methods in order to protect what is roost precious to us. We must act with determination and translate our good intentions into deeds. We must make concrete proposals and ensure that they are implemented.lb this end  the Seychelles  whose survival depends very largely on its maritime environment  is justifiably worried about the consequences of climatic changes resulting from global ecological imbalance. We cannot remain indifferent to such a phenomenon  particularly since two thirds of our archipelago comprises atolls threatened with submersion if the sea-level continues to rise at its present rate.We therefore welcome the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone layer and find it very reassuring that several countries have shown themselves ready to undertake a gradual elimination of destructive substances.I agree that there can be no immediate response or magic solution to the tragedy of today  the steady worsening of our environment. But we must shoulder our responsibilities and take appropriate action. Here again  commitments and mutual concessions are necessary and they must be brought about at an early date.  History is in constant movement urging humanity to acquire new machinery for its own protection and survival. Machinery already exists for international co-operation thanks to which a number of important natural sites have been saved from annihilation. I am referring to the Convention on the world heritage. It is within the framework of this Convention that the Republic of Seychelles gave as a gift to humanity one of its islands  Aldabra. Since 19 November 1982  this jewel of nature has been a universal nature and peace conservation site. We believe that within the framework of this Convention  more sites  particularly those of an ecological nature  could be safeguarded and protected for future generations. Within this context  we support the proposal to levy an international tax on pollution. The revenue thus obtained could be used for the implementation of ecological preservation programmes or programmes for restoring damaged ecosystems. This revenue would also go to finance environmental protection programmes of developing countries  the vast majority of which today are playing a major role in the preservation of our planet. Not only do they receive practically nothing in return  but the effects of the external debt have turned them into net exporters of capital. This new tax would help restore the flow of credit and finance development activities that could improve conditions of life.There is another environmental problem  one that is even more disastrous and more urgent - that of toxic waste dumped clandestinely on the high seas. Toxic substances have already been dumped secretly in the waters of the south-west pact of the Indian Ocean near our coast. After a long time now zones in the south of the Pacific as well as in the Caribbean have been used for this purpose. Now these zones are saturated and the multinationals have endeavoured to find new sites in the developing countries  particularly in Africa  for the dumping of toxic materials. Small island States in particular have little means of countering this problem. Let me take the case of my own country. Seychelles has a hundred or so islands and an exclusive economic zone of 1 million square kilometres. Members will understand that to patrol the territory is neither easy nor indeed possible. On the other hand  we have neither the means nor the necessary resources to exercise our jurisdiction over this vast tract of ocean. How then can prevent a ship from dumping its toxic waste in our waters or on one of our more remote islands? What kind of action can be taken in such circumstances?The last summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Countries  held in Belgrade  ended with an appeal to States to adopt effective measures  including conventions and other appropriate juridical instruments  to interdict the dumping of toxic and other dangerous wastes in the territory of third-world countries. It was also proposed that developed countries should adopt strict administrative and legal measures which would prohibit the export of toxic waste to developing countries. My country  in its turn  urges here solidarity and co-operation on the part of the international community to see that these proposals are translated into deeds.Furthermore  industrialized countries must understand that their energy consumption is the greatest cause of pollution of the biosphere. The use of those kinds of energy sources in developing countries is undesirable. The technologies of the industrialized countries are often either inappropriate or not easily adapted to the social and economic situation of developing countries. Those countries need adapted technologies - non-polluting technologies - as well as appropriate technologies for the preservation and promotion of the environment.What we want here is not complacency or complicity but rather solidarity  which falls outside any polemical context. We want to re-examine the terms of the problem in favour of man and his environment within the framework of the economic stakes. We must  however  concede that because of our lack of historical vigilance we are witnessing today an alarming world ecological intolerance. We see before our very eyes an ineluctable widening of the gap between the growth of the industrialized world and the economic prospects of the developing countries: national debt  stagnation of and investment  a drop in commodity prices  and so forth.The environment can be protected only if hunger and poverty are eliminated  A world in which poverty is endemic is likely to suffer ecological disasters. Debt-servicing and the drop in commodity prices have obliged many developing countries to over-exploit their natural resources to maintain their export earnings. Debts they cannot pay have led those countries  which depend above all on the export of commodities  to over-exploit their soil  and as a result they have turned arable land into desert. It is essential to find solutions to alleviate the debt burden that represent a more equitable distribution of responsibilities between creditor and debtor countries. The pursuit of an environmental policy compatible with the objectives of lasting development is practical only within the framework of a rationale economic order  because the present system perpetuates underdevelopment. It constitutes the principal source of pollution. It pollutes through hunger and the exploitation of the weakest.This is not the time for utopian writings  complete with safaris and coconut trees  nor for chroniclers who write so prettily of the flowers of culture  of poverty. There must be solidarity - it is more than ever necessary - because poverty is not inevitable  nor is it a genetic trait. Such solidarity must be demonstrated above all in the international economy. The poorest countries must benefit in particular from the support of the international community. The flow of financial resources to developing countries must be increased substantially. Multilateral organizations in particular must contribute. Their help is needed more than ever before.It is therefore indispensable that the financial resources made available to developing countries be adequate to enable them to pursue a sound economic policy  and there must also be respect for the priorities of the beneficiary countries rather than those at the donor countries. We must put an end to the era of ecological negligence if we want to prevent the world from being stripped of its forests and marine life and to avoid the danger of the rising sea level and continuous climatic fluctuations. The sources of the deterioration of the environment must be identified  and strategies requiring lasting action must be adopted.If those complex problems are to be dealt with  it is imperative that the international community as a whole - including scientists. Governments and non-governmental organizations - take part in the process of eliminating those scourges that impede the harmonious and integrated concerted management of the world heritage of nature that is our environment. The protection of the environment should be considered an integral part of the development process.If we wish to promote international co-operation that will be effective in the protection of the environment  we must reach agreement on the concept of lasting development. This concept should include satisfying the fundamental needs of all people  stable economic growth  and  above all accelerated development for the developing countries and an improvement in the quality of life.In this regard I hope that the 1992 Conference will include on its agenda problems relating to the environment within the context of the new realities of economic and social development. Experts from more than 50 countries are already examining the concrete problems relating to an ecological renascence. We share the conviction that wisdom demands that we work together intensively and with a genuine commitment to sharing our global responsibilities if we are to preserve the dignity of mankind."
"133",6648,"SYR",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  particularly  as your country  Nigeria  and mine  Syria  enjoy long-standing relations of friendship  and both are members of the Non-Aligned Countries  in which our two countries are united in the common struggle against colonialism and all forms of racism.I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the success achieved by your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  in guiding the work of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. I wish his country  Argentina  progress and prosperity in the future.It is natural for feelings of optimism to prevail in most of the statements delivered so far in this historic forum as a reflection of the improvement in the international climate  and of the move the world has taken  following years of confrontation  tension aid cold war  to a new phase of detente  dialogue and co-operation.There is no doubt that this change in the climate of international relations would not have taken place without the significant Soviet-United States dialogue and the agreements and initiatives that dialogue has led to in the field of disarmament  particularly with regard to nuclear aid chemical weapons. These are indeed important steps on a long road  and the peoples of the world hope that this will not be a dead-end road. The gravest danger is essentially the actual presence of weapons of mass destruction  not merely their numbers. The maintenance of any arsenals of these destructive weapons  however limited  will always be a terrifying nightmare for humanity as a whole.The peoples of the world further expect that this process will not be selective and limited only to one type of weapons of mass destruction  because no one can claim that there are clean weapons of mass destruction aid dirty weapons of mass destruction. All nuclear and chemical weapons are undoubtedly both destructive and dirty. Indeed  those weapons had been used by man against man in the past  causing incalculable suffering. What then would be the consequences of the use of such weapons of mass destruction in the future  with their more sophisticated developments?Proceeding from our firm conviction that all States of the world should participate in the process of eliminating and prohibiting all kinds of weapons of mass destruction  the Syrian Arab Republic calls for the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction  whether nuclear  chemical or biological  in the Middle East region. We believe that the United Nations provides the appropriate framework for the achievement of such an objective.Although some years have elapsed since the beginning of the improvement in the atmosphere of international relations  a development which has had a positive effect on regional disputes throughout the world  the Arab-Israeli conflict is continuing to take a different course. It is a conflict developing in an atmosphere of tension and confrontation. The reason is clear and does not require lengthy explanation. The rulers of Israel  with their Zionist doctrine  which is unmatched in fanaticism and fundamentalism  continue to live in another age  although they possess the most advanced means  the latest equipment  particularly in the field of armaments.Those rulers continue to rely on myths and illusions to justify the realization of their final objective of establishing the greater Israel from theNile to the Euphrates. This is an objective which they do not  and  indeed  cannot conceal. We all recall how furious the Israeli rulers were with their American friends when they advised them to renounce their dream of a Greater Israel.When they fail to convince their closest allies of their false claims  the rulers of Israel resort - as Moshe Arens did in his statement to the General Assembly last week - to documents and promises that go back to colonial times  to records kept in the archives of the League of Nations to justify their continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. At the same time they flagrantly ignore the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the United Nations which call upon Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and call for the recognition of the inalienable national rights of the Arab Palestinian people.The problem facing the peace process in the Middle East is not merely the dilemma of the dreams of Israel  it is a problem of Israeli practices also. The rulers of Israel keep on reminding the world every day of the Nazi crimes against the Jews  although those crimes came to an end when the Second World War was over  45 years ago. Yet  at the same time  they continue to perpetrate crimes against the Arabs  crimes which have gone on to this very day  and to which we do not see an end in the near future.The rulers of Israel are attempting to maintain the so-called purity of the Jewish State aid yet at the same time they persist in continuing their occupation  of Arab lands. This has placed them in a state of continuous confrontation in their attempt to clear the land of its people  and has led them to carry out practices even more heinous than the racist practices of apartheid South Africa. It is a contradiction in terms for the Israelis to protest against the General\assembly resolution which equated Zionism with racism while the rulers of Israel themselves confirm the validity and credibility of this resolution by their repressive measures against the Arab population in the occupied territories.The Israelis do not want peace because they want both peace and the land  his they cannot achieve. Any initiative within this framework of Israeli concepts cannot succeed. The heroic Palestinian intifadah  the brave resistance in southern Lebanon  the steadfastness of our people in the occupied Syrian Golan  were all  first and foremost  a revolt against these very concepts. Peace cannot be achieved without a full Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and without the safeguarding of the inalienable national rights of the Arab Palestinian people  including its right to self-determination and to establish its own State in Palestine  in accordance with United Nations resolutions.The Syrian Arab Republic believes that the appropriate framework in which to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East is an international conference  convened under United Nations auspices  with the participation of all the parties concerned  including the Palestine Liberation Organization.In the period between September 1988 and September this year Lebanon witnessed the worst chapter in the history of its civil war. Today as the artillery has fallen silent  as the Lebanese are emerging from their shelters  as the evacuees are returning home  as dialogue has started between the Lebanese members of Parliament  and as genuine stands can be distinguished from false ones  it may not seem as pressing as it once was to talk about Lebanon in detail.However  events during that period in the brotherly country of Lebanon - the killing  destruction and homelessness  accompanied by a most misleading mass media campaign - are not simple matters that can be ignored or forgotten. That is particularly so since the plot was not directed only at Lebanon and the unity of its people and territory? it was also aimed at putting pressure on Syria and all that Syria represents  but Syria stood staunch and steadfast in the face of the greedy Israeli designs. The plot was also aimed at drawing a thick veil over the Palestinian intifadah and the aspirations for liberation and independence that it represents.Thus the plot was not as small as its instrument in East Beirut  nor was it such as was deliberately portrayed to many people all over the world. Rather  we can say without any hesitation that what that distorted picture was intended to establish was only part of a larger scenario for the plot  whose major perpetrators  both regionally and internationally  tried not to appear openly on the stage where the events were played out.Certain countries devoted themselves to guiding those events. Many capitals were mobilized to escalate them; huge amounts of weapons and ammunition were shipped to keep the fires blazing; secret contacts were made to follow up the events; warships and fleets were moved and manoeuvred; prayer meetings were held; and the Security Council was convened more than once to contain the events.Those who designed the events tried to turn the facts upside down  in an attempt to achieve their goals. In that they were abetted by organized campaigns of misinformation on the international level. Hence  from their distorted perspective  the chief of a minority military Government in East Beirut was made to be seen as if he had become the President of the whole of Lebanon. Thus they totally ignored the Lebanese Parliament and the Prime Minister of the national Government in West Beirut  which represents the overwhelming majority of the Lebanese people  Muslims and Christians alike.Then they invoked that false claim in order to portray the problem as if it were a problem between Syria and Lebanon  and not  as it really is  between a minority of Lebanese  who had maintained a monopoly over power under the constitution laid down by the French Mandate authorities in 1926  and the majority of Lebanese  who are demanding political and constitutional reforms in order to guarantee the equality of all Lebanese citizens.On the basis of those fallacies the perpetrators of the events then made another desperate attempt to claim that the Syrian presence in Lebanon was illegal. By so doing  they aimed to attain three goals at the same time: first to cover up the illegality of the minority military Government-  secondly  to avoid meeting the just demands of the Lebanese majority for reforms and equality  and  thirdly  to justify the continuation of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon.At any rate  the recent statement by the Tripartite Committee of the Arab Heads of State was a positive turning point in the dangerous course of events that Lebanon has witnessed since September last year. That statement called for a cease-fire  the lifting of the blockades and the formation of a Lebanese security committee to monitor the cease-fire and to inspect ships in order to prevent shipments of arms and supplies to any party. That is exactly what Syria has been calling on all the Lebanese parties to accept ever since the outbreak of the bloody events in Lebanon  because we believe that those elements constitute the only right way to begin dialogue between the Lebanese parties and to bring about a political solution to the Lebanese crisis.Syria promptly endorsed the Committee's statement. It also stressed its support for the Committee's efforts to implement the resolution on Lebanon adopted by the Arab summit at Casablanca and affirmed its commitment to help the Lebanese government eventually formed at the outcome of national reconciliation to extend its authority over the whole of the Lebanese territory. In so doing it was motivated by the distinct Syrian-Lebanese relationship  which draws its strength from the roots of kinship  history and common strategic interests. Syria welcomes the beginning of implementation of the United lotions plan for Namibia's independence. We hope that the plan will be fully implemented and that elections will take place next month  as scheduled  without intimidation  threats or interference  so that the people of Namibia will be enabled to achieve independence and sovereignty over the whole of its territory  and to become mastersof their destiny under the leadership of the South West Africa People's organization.However  we must not forget the disgraceful racist regime  which the international community has condemned and whose practices it has deemed a crime against humanity. There should be an intensification of international efforts to isolate the Pretoria regime and to support the black majority  so that it nay be enabled to eradicate the racist regime and realize the national aspirations of the people of South Africa  for freedom and equality.With regard to the situation in Afghanistan we believe that there is a need to adhere faithfully and accurately to the terms of the Geneva Agreements without any interference or intervention in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  to preserve of its territorial integrity and non-aligned status  and to establish a government of national reconciliation which would represent all segments of the Afghan people.Syria  which enjoys historic relations of friendship with Cyprus  expresses its hope that the ongoing contacts between the Greek and Turkish communities will lead to a comprehensive settlement of the question of Cyprus based on relevant United Nations resolutions. In this respect  Syria supports the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General aimed at finding a solution to this problem.We wish once again to renew our support for the efforts made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea peacefully to reunite the Korean peninsula through negotiations and for the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.International economic relations continue to be based on unjust and unbalanced foundations and therefore these relations will need to be reshaped and restructured in order to create a new economic order that would help to achieve balanced social and economic growth in the world. The special session of the General Assembly to be convened in April 1990 and devoted to international economic co-operation takes on particular importance as regards the solutions to basic problems that stand in the way of growth in developing countries  foremost among which are problems of external debt  financial and monetary problems  international trade  the prices of raw materials in developing countries  problems of a scientific and technological order and problems of nutrition  agriculture and environment.In this respect it is worth mentioning that the political improvement in the international climate and in international relations does not necessarily constitute a parallel factor in improving international economic relations  particularly vis-Ã -vis the developing countries.The policy of self-reliance and the encouragement of South-South co-operation are two basic prerequisites for the improvement of the economies of developing countries and encouraging industrial countries to start a serious dialogue on an equal footing between North and South because it is in the vital interests of all the peoples of the world.Following the improvement in the international climate the peoples of the world look to this international forum as a place in which to find effective solutions to the complicated problems from which they suffer  whether those problems result from aggression and oppression or from poverty and environmental pollution. These aspirations are not easy to achieve although they remain legitimate and attainable provided good intentions and political will prevail among us all."
"134",6693,"TCD",44,1989,"ï»¿First of all  on behalf of the Chad delegation  which I have the honour of heading  I should like to convey to Mr. Joseph Garba our most earnest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. As Chad has a common border and so many historical bonds with Nigeria - his great country â it can only express satisfaction that he is directing our work. His election  which does honour to all of Africa  is a tribute to his talents as a diplomat and an experienced statesman. He may be assured of the full co-operation of ray delegation in carrying out his difficult responsibilities.I should like also to express to Mr  Dante Caputo  the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  the gratitude of ray delegation for his excellent work as President of the General Assembly at its forty-third session. The Chad delegation would like  once again  to pay a well-deserved tribute to the dynamic Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose dedication to the cause of peace and development deserves the admiration of all. In his report on the activities of the Organization  the Secretary-General notes that there is increased co-operation between the permanent members of the Security Council in the quest for solutions to international conflicts and  above all  that the two major blocs have undertaken a quest for lasting peace. This trend in international relations  which are now based more on trust  should be encouraged.Indeed  the Second World War  the fiftieth anniversary of whose beginning we are marking this year  is an appropriate reminder of the painful circumstances that led to the founding of the United Nations. This reminder of history should  above all  compel us to work in solidarity to strengthen the San Francisco Charter. The solemn commitment to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  is still coming up against difficulties  even though the atmosphere today would seem to be mote than ever propitious for universal peace. The Government of the Republic of Chad  for its part  has always worked for peace in international relations and in its own relations with neighbouring countries.In this connection  the process begun last year in the context of the Chad-Libya conflict  with the assistance of friendly countries  continued. That process represented a step forward in the improvement of relations between the two States. Thanks to the persevering activities of the President of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)  Mr. Moussa Traore  President of the Republic of Mali  of the President of the Republic of Gabon and Mr. Al-Hadj Omar Bongo  and of the President of the Ad HÐ¾Ñ Committee of the OAU on the Chad-Libya dispute  Mt. Chedli Bendjedid  President of the Democratic People's Republic of Algeria  Chad and Libya signed  in Algiers on 31 August 1989  a framework agreement on the settlement of their dispute. Years of deadly confrontation between two countries fated by history and geography to live together in peace have given rise to substantial human and material loss. That situation  which forced Chad to devote its meagre resources to purposes of defence  considerably delayed our country's reconstruction and development.Having always held that Chad and Libya have better things to do than make war  the Chadian Government promptly demonstrated its approval of the Algiers Agreement by proceeding  as early as 1 September 1989  to release a group of Libyan prisoners of war. We hope that this significant gesture  which reflects Chad's goodwill towards the brotherly Libyan people and its respect for the pledge it made  will open the way to the final settlement of a conflict pitting two brotherly States against each other in the Chadian region of Aozou.By envisaging conciliation as an initial stage  the Agreement appeals to the two parties to show the political determination to establish lasting peace between them. Only if this machinery does not yield the desired result within a year will the International Court of Justice be seized of the territorial dispute.Additional measures are provided for as part of the implementation of the Agreement  including the withdrawal of the forces of the two countries from positions they occupied as of 25 August 1989 in the disputed region  this withdrawal is to take place under the supervision of an African observer commission  and there is to be a ban on any new settlements  in whatever form  in the region.Reiterating their decision concerning the cease-fire that took effect on 11 September 1987  Chad and Libya also undertook to end any hostility  especially all hostile media campaigns to refrain from direct or Indirect Interference  In any form  under any pretext and in any circumstances  in the internal and external affairs of their respective countriesâ to ban any political  material  financial or military support to any forces hostile to either of the two countries; and to proceed to the signing of a treaty of friendship  good-neighbourliness and economic and financial co-operation between the two countries A joint committee will be established to lay down the provisions for the implementation of the Agreement and to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to that effect. The Ad Hoc Committee of the Organization of African Unity on the Chad-Libyan dispute is to follow up the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement.Those are the salient points of the Agreement  which ushers in a new era in relations between Chad and Libya. But need I point out that the strength of any agreement lies in the political will of those who implement it? Thus  the full  practical implementation of the Algiers Agreement will be the measure of the scope and value of the commitments entered into. For its part  Chad has already communicated this important Agreement to the Secretariat of the United Nations  in accordance with article 7 of the Agreement.From this rostrum  my delegation expresses the sincere gratitude of the Government and people of Chad to all the illustrious Heads of State who have made such a positive contribution to the ushering in of this new era - which we hope will be a felicitous One - in the relations between Chad and Libya. As we have always maintained  this Agreement bears witness to Chad's constant desire to live in peace with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  strictly respecting its sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and basic rights. That is our creed  and our commitment to peace is unequivocal. As they resolutely face the future the Chadian people  at peace with themselves and united in their great movement - the National Onion for Independence and Revolution - aspire to a better standard of living. In this regard  the second Congress of the Union  held in N'Djamena in November 1988  adopted major decisions  which the Government is now implementing.In political terms  the draft of a new Constitution  submitted by the Constitutional Committee several months ago  will be put to the Chadian people in 1990 for adoption. The aim of that referendum to be held in 1990 is thus approval of the new constitutional law  and thereby the consolidation of the process of normalization of national life and the establishment of political stability by providing the country with adequate and viable institutions taking into account the far-reaching aspirations of our people and the political  social and economic realities of our country.In economic terms  although - as in fact the Secretary-General points out in his report on the programme of special economic assistance to Chad - A favourable pattern of rainfall in Chad in 1987/88 resulted in a striking recovery in agricultural output in 1988/89 from the depressed 1987 levels (A/44/418  para  Î²)  the country remains subject to the vagaries of nature. In that connection  the floods in August last year once again defeated Chad's efforts to achieve food self-sufficiency. Efforts are still under way to that end. Henceforth the emphasis will be placed on the development of off-season irrigated crops in order to cope with the country's erratic rainfall patterns. The fact that 700 000 tons of grain were produced last year gives us reason to hope that the better use of new crop technologies will indeed help Chad to achieve food self-sufficiency.Nevertheless  the country remains dominated by one crop t cotton. The price for this commodity is set by stock-market speculators and is completely beyond the control of the State. In spite of the efforts made sacrifices made  and a slight improvement in cotton prices  this sector still shows a deficit. In those circumstances  while it continues to put into effect measures to improve the whole process in this respect  the Chadian Government is forced to seek condensation elsewhere foe losses in revenue resulting from the elimination of export taxes on cotton fibre. Aware of the disastrous effects the instability in the prices of agricultural commodities could have  the Chadian Government is determined to make cattle-raising the true second staple of the country. In this regard  a large national livestock programme is now being implemented. Its objective is to maximize the capacity of the livestock sector in order to counterbalance the disadvantages of the cultivation of cotton as our sole crop. Development of cattle-raising not only will bring more income to the people of Chad but also will lead to an increase in trade between Chad and its neighbours and other countries of Central Africa. As can be seen  the economic and financial situation of Chad remains a difficult one  and is quite precarious despite the radical measures taken by the Government and the sacrifices made by the people of Chad. In its efforts to improve the living conditions of its people the Government is giving priority to self-sufficiency in food as well as to education and health  by closely involving the population in implementation programmes.In these circumstances external financial assistance will for many years to come continue to play an essential role in the implementation of economic and social programmes in Chad. With that in mind  the Government of Chad intends to organize  in 1990  with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme  two round-table conferences: one on education and the development of human resources  and the other on public health and the family - population questions. During those two meetings the Government of the Republic of Chad will submit to friendly countries and international bodies programmes to finance sectors vital to the development of our country.Furthermore  pursuant to resolution 43/205  my Government intends in 1990 to submit to donors and creditors a four-year plan now being developed in co-operation with the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank. We sincerely hope that  like the Geneva conferences of 1982 and 1985 on international assistance to Chad  and the meetings and round-table conferences on the recovery of the Borkou-Ehnedi-Tibesti region held in previous years  the international community will give massive assistance in response to our appeal  which proposes financing for each sector as well as the priority development projects of the four-year plan. While relying on its own efforts for reconstruction and the beginning of true agricultural development  Chad is grateful to the friendly countries and international organizations which  since the restoration of State authority  have constantly supported us through diverse and appropriate forms of assistance.With the continued return of refugees  assistance from the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees remains necessary to and their resettlement. Similarly many parts of the border region are still inaccessible because of the mines land during the occupation  which prevents the return of displaced persons to their area of origin. Here again we count on the international community to help us - on the one hand  to make the area habitable and  on the other  to provide the necessary minimum assistance to displaced persons.Taking into account the overall economic and social situation of Chad  whose special characteristics should be borne in mind  my delegation will once again this year submit two draft resolutions: one to the Second Committee  for special economic assistance  and the other to the Third Committee  for emergency humanitarian assistance. We hope that those draft resolutions will be supported by all delegations at the current session.The encouraging results seen in Chad through its efforts at reconstruction and economic recovery would not have been possible without the constant and substantial support of friendly countries. Chad extends its gratitude to them. It also thanks governmental and non-governmental organizations for the substantial support they have given in this immense effort at Rational reconstruction. The activities of the united Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  as the co-ordinating agency for the operational activities of the United Nations  must be emphasized and welcomed.While the major objective of the United Nations Is to ensure peace and security  we should recall that economic and social development Is essential to achievement of that objective  unfortunately we are obliged to observe that the current International economic system Is characterized by increased imbalances and inequalities  with grave consequences for the stability of the developing countries. As the Secretary-General emphasized at the 1989 second regular session of the Economic and Social Council when he said  We ate deeply concerned to see the large number of countries in Africa  Latin America and Asia that are prisoners of poverty and to report that their efforts are failing because of an unfavourable international climate and a deterioration in their internal problems .That clear-sighted analysis should compel the international community to make efforts to find bolder solutions. In this regard the delegation of Chad commends the proposals of the French and American Presidents  Francois Mitterand and George Bush  to cancel pact of the loans their countries have given to Africa in the form of public assistance for development. Those welcome decisions  which recognize that to be viable any solution to the problem of the indebtedness of the African countries must involve a reduction in debt  deserve our support and should be followed by all the industrialized countries.Furthermore  the growing marginalization of the African economies  which continues to be caused by a deterioration in the terms of trade  requires immediate international attention. In this connection the international community should play an active role in seeking the reform of raw materials markets. In particular steps should be taken to enhance the effectiveness of the common fund for commodities so that speculators might be forced to charge fairer prices more in keeping with the efforts made by producer countries. Indeed  structural reforms in the economies of third world countries cannot allow real development unless they are supported by appropriate export earnings.For now the situation in the third world countries is tragic and characterized by zero growth  a reduced standard of living and a high rate of inflation. Ironically  in current economic relations  the net transfer of capital from the South to the North from 1982 to 1988 was approximately S300 billion  whereas the capital flow to the developing countries declined considerably. This negative trend should be corrected. The convening in 1990 of a special session of the General Assembly Ñ international economic co-operation  in particular on renewed growth in the economies and the development of developing countries  will provide an opportunity for the taking of appropriate measures. Chad fully supports the fourth international development strategy  which should be broadly based on past experience to foster sustained economic growth for the developing countries. today the environment is gaining increased attention from the international community because of a better understanding of its broad implications. The convening of an international conference on the environment and development in 1992 will be a major step forward in the process under way to ensure better protection.Certain kinds of environmental problems are being experienced daily by the peoples of the Sahel. Indeed  drought and desertification continue to be of major concern to the Governments members of the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CIIiSS). Indeed  the shrinkage of ground cover  the decrease in surface water  the reduction in fishing resources  the drop in water tables and the drying up of wells have sorely tried the economies of those countries. The situation has been aggravated by the debt burden and the fall in prices of agricultural raw materials  making the result of these efforts uncertain. On the occasion of CILSS Day  12 September 1989  His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre  current Chairman of the Committee  stated. The challenge of the Sahel continues to confront us  but our first victory is the one we must win over ourselves. The joint strategies adopted by the States members of CILSS will no doubt enable us batter to meet that challenge  but the results obtained thus far remain meagre when compared to the scope of the problem. Thus the States members of CILSS ate once again appealing to the international community to lend its support within the framework of a plan of action to contain desertification.Experience in recent years has shown that  when united. States can cope effectively with major challenges  whether they be natural disasters or such evils as drugs  ANDS and terrorism. W.'-h regard to terrorism  one of the most recent incidents has been the airline disaster of 19 September 1989  which cost the lives of 171 innocent persons  including 40 Chadians  among them the Minister of Planning and Co-operation His Excellency Mahamat Soumaila. My delegation vigorously condemns the wantonness  cruelty and inhumanity of terrorism. Chad not only condemns the abhorrent act but will combat terrorism from whatever quarter it comes and whatever form it may take. All States must therefore actively participate in wiping out these plagues threatening all of the international community by making full use of the irreplaceable instrumentation of the United Nations.Today we note with satisfaction the praiseworthy efforts being made to initiate a dynamic of peace and put an end to the hotbeds of tension and war by which many areas of the globe are sorely tried.In that connection the implementation of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) on the independence of Namibia is clearly a decisive step towards the realisation of the goal the Organization has set itself. However  acts of intimidation and South Africa's deliberate attempts to sabotage that territory's peaceful accession to international sovereignty are direct threats to peace and stability in that long-troubled region. Chad therefore calls upon the Security Council to exert all its influence to ensure respect for resolutions 435 (1978)  632 (1989) and 640 (1989).Subtle oppression and violence continue to prevail in South Africa  where apartheid still reigns as the supreme form of colonialism. In that connection His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre  President of the Republic of Chad  recently stated 	.The entire world condemns that system  which is the total negation of the rights of peoples and of human rights  but it continues to exist and to hold sway. Indeed  everyone condemns apartheid  but not everyone fights for its disappearance  especially those with the withdraw to succeed. In order to improve the current international political climate  the Government of South Africa should not just make timid advances to the majority  but instead  finally put an end to its outmoded practice and inaugurate a true democracy based on the principle of one man  one votes in an equal and multiracial society.In Angola  where a positive process has begun  Chad encourages dialogue leading to a final reconciliation among Angolans.With regard to Western Sahara  Chad welcomes the initiatives under way and firmly supports the efforts of the Secretary-General and the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).The hope created by the signature of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan has not yet been realized. Chad appeals to the political will of the Afghan leaders to spate their people further suffering. Similarly  the world's attention has been focused on the Paris Conference  which offered a historic opportunity to put an end to the long conflict and the sufferings of the Kampuchean people. In spite of the meagre results obtained  owing to the complexity of the situation  there are grounds for hope that the sense of responsibility and interest of the Kampuchean people will prevail during future meetings and that the withdrawal of foreign troops will be accomplished.The situation in the Middle East  at the core of which is   the tragic Palestinian problem  demands our attention. Twenty-two months after the beginning of the intifadah the Palestinian people have shown their goodwill by agreeing to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Chad  which has always supported the struggle of the Palestinian people for the exercise of their inalienable rights and which recognized the Palestinian State upon its proclamation at Algiers  supports the idea of the convening of an international conference bringing together all the parties concerned  together with the permanent members of the Security Council  as the best means of achieving a comprehensive solution to the problem. With regard to Lebanon Chad deplores the violence in that part of the world. We appeal urgently to all parties to exercise restraint and we call upon foreign forces to cease their interference. The independence  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon should be respected  in keeping with Security Council resolution 639 (1989).By its tireless efforts the international community has contributed to putting an end to the bloody  murderous conflict between Iran and Iraq. Not all the pending issues have yet been settled and there is still cause for concern. For this reason  Chad urges both countries to engage resolutely in the search for a comprehensive  just and lasting peace through compliance with and full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987)  and supports the role of the Secretary-General to that end.Similarly  Chad encourages any initiative that would obviate any further delay in the processes under way on the Korean peninsula  in Cyprus and in Central America.  This brief overview of the international political situation  which has been marked by conflicts and tensions  should encourage us to make better use of the existing machinery in order to establish peace the world over. The fundamental given fact of our time is peaceful coexistence  which  if violated  inevitably jeopardizes international peace and security. These are still  unfortunately  based on doubtful realities such as the balance of terror and the principle of might makes right. Nevertheless  it is comforting to note the increasing awareness  on the part of nations the world over  of the imperative need to change this state of affairs.In this regard  Chad commends the progress achieved by the super-Powers towards disarmament  which reflects a determination and a sense of responsibility that take into account the concerns of mankind. These basic concerns are  first and foremost  international peace and security  which depend on general and complete disarmament  respect for the principles of international law governing relations among States  and equitable international economic relations whereby all countries  producers and consumers of commodities  will act in such a way that they feel that they are complementary because  one of the most precious human rights is that of receiving just remuneration for one's work.The best possible living conditions for all peoples the world over - that is in fact the goal which all of mankind should pursue in good faith and in all honesty. I would conclude here with a quotation from the President and Head of State of the Government of Chad  His Excellency Al-Hadj Hissein Habre:Peace and security  we cannot repeat it enough  have a direct effect on the lives of peoples My delegation believes that the States Members of the United Nations should act with this in view in order to achieve the basic objectives of a more just world  one in which nations would live on good terms with each other and where peoples  freed from the shackles of squalor and poverty  would exist together in perfect harmony  with understanding  with love for each other  in a word  in universal peace."
"135",6739,"TGO",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. ADODO (Togo): Mr. President  the Togolese delegation is particularly gratified at your unanimous election to preside over the work of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Apart from your great qualities as a diplomat who is versed in the affairs of our Organization  the historical ties  marked by friendly cooperation and active solidarity  which link Nigeria with Togo are all reasons why the Togolese delegation will offer you its support and full and frank co-operation as you carry out your new duties.Allow me to pay a tribute also to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  who directed the work of the forty-third session with remarkable skill and competence and to the entire satisfaction of the Togolese delegation. I once again warmly congratulate him. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  faithful to himself as well as to the principles and purposes of the United Nations  during the forty-third session took a number of timely initiatives that strengthened the chances for peace and restored the credibility as well as the effectiveness of our universal Organization. It is therefore a very pleasant duty for me once again to offer the Secretary-General the warm congratulations of the Government of Togo on the dynamic  effective and devoted way in which he has been discharging his responsibilities.In its activities designed to bring about general and complete disarmament with effective verification machinery  the international community has assigned the main responsibility to the two major Powers. The implementation of the Treaty on medium-range nuclear weapons  the ongoing negotiations to reduce strategic arsenals by one half  the phased ban on nuclear-weapons tests  the stepping up of negotiations to conclude an international convention totally banning chemical weapons all provide further opportunities for action and for peace.In this connection  the regional centres of the United Nations for peace and disarmament should be confirmed as the privileged purveyors of information and training to all those who  because of the responsibilities entrusted to them  may have some influence on the maintenance of international peace and security. My country  Togo  which is honoured to be the host country for the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa  hopes that that Centre will be able very soon to contribute  through its activities  to increasing confidence among the States of the continent and concerting their efforts to promote peace.Peace  which our Organization holds so dear  remains precarious in many regions of Asia  America and Africa  with regard to Asia  the agreement which is being sought within the context of the International Conference on Cambodia must necessarily take account of all those concerns in order to ensure the unity and national reconciliation which is the best possible way of safeguarding the independence and integrity of that long-ravaged country. In that connection  the recent informal ministerial meetings in Jakarta and the diplomatic meetings in Paris are positive contributions to the process of re-establishing peace in Cambodia. We also believe that the withdrawal of foreign troops and direct negotiation among the parties will be likely to pave the way to a peaceful solution.A global and lasting settlement of the Afghan question requires that all Parties to the conflict make sincere efforts towards creating conditions favouring the return of the refugees and bringing about national reconciliation. It is therefore incumbent upon the four signatory countries to the Geneva Agreements to act together to prevent any further foreign interference imperilling the efforts that have been made up till now to put an end to hostilities in that country.The conflict between Iran and Iraq  because of its length  its breadth and the inherent risk of its spreading internationally  has created one of the deepest breaches in the activities of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security  it is therefore very gratifying that the joint initiatives of the Security Council and the Secretary-General led to the acceptance by the two States of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The cessation of hostilities  beginning on 20 August 1988  should therefore he utilized to reach a negotiated settlement that is just and acceptable to all.The same objective should be sought in the Korean peninsula. This is why we would encourage the leaders of the two States to pursue  without relenting  the dialogue they initiated to determine what measures should be taken to increase trust between them and to achieve the final objective of the peaceful reunification of their countries. This reunification  the modalities of which are to be determined by that negotiation  seems to us to be an essential component of political stability in that region.In Central America the peace initiatives  in particular the Arias Plan  have confirmed the commitment of the States in that region to settle the crisis developing there themselves without any outside interference. The Esquipulas Agreements have laid the groundwork for such a situation. Those recently concluded at Costa del Sol and Tela by the five Central American Heads of State quite judiciously determined the context and conditions for peace in that region. All these initiatives deserve the active support of our Organization.In Western Sahara  the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front  alter having on 30 August 1988 stated their agreement to the referendum on the self-determination of the Sahraoui people presented by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  have in this connection established a dialogue of which we expect a great deal  above all that it will speed up the peace process. All efforts should therefore be focused to that end so as to avoid the widespread resumption of hostilities which would once more involve considerable loss of human life.The crisis that has beset the Middle East for some decades now has in recent weeks witnessed developments which have caused us all concern and demonstrated that no viable solution is possible without a settlement of the Palestinian problem  which is its real crux. The Togolese Government very early recognized the new Palestinian State. By so doing we wished to reaffirm our unflagging support for the right of peoples to self-determination  freedom and independence.In this connection the establishment of a dialogue between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PIO) and the United States Government is a positive element in the process of a Middle East settlement. My country believes that everything should be done to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of all parties  including the PLO  so that a settlement could be reached as soon as possible that would guarantee the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people as well as the rights of all peoples in the region  including Israel  to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized boundaries.Today  more than ever before  we must reach out to one another through open and constructive dialogue. We have to avoid the pointless and absurd suffering that is being inflicted on peoples who are living every day in an atmosphere of fear  anguish and death in the Middle East.Lebanon has until recently been the living embodiment of this daily tragedy a to a certain extent has constituted a denial of the purposes and principles of our Organization. Today the weapons have fallen silent. Hope has been reborn  thanks to the timely mediation of the Arab League and the co-operation of the parties to the conflict. The Togolese Government welcomes the cease-fire agreement an would like to express the hope that this initial step will in a non-violent way led to peace and political stability  without which none of the problems facing this courageous people can be resolved in an appropriate way. The recent development of the situation in southern Africa  particularly in connection with the coming independence of Namibia  warrants a certain degree of optimism. First  it is becoming more and more obvious that peace and reconciliation in Angola are essential to stability throughout the region. They are likewise essential to strengthening the forthcoming independence of Namibia. Therefore it is essential that the efforts made by the African Heads of State at Gbadolite  Hat ire and elsewhere to promote peace and reconciliation in Angola as well as for the independence of Namibia be fully crowned with success.  In southern Africa the black majority  determined to write the glorious pages of its own history  has demanded  through powerful and peaceful demonstrations  that apartheid be dismantled  that the Exception Laws be revoked  and Mandela be I reed. All peace- and justice-loving nations must step up their economic  financial and political pressure on a regime that  since Mr. de Klerk came to power  has changed its speeches but not its policies. The ambiguity of language from the new leaders of Pretoria reveals the impossibility of reforming in any way this absurd system based on contempt and injustice.Turning now to Namibia  no one can underestimate the dangers besetting the new State which  throughout the long history of decolonization  is the only one to have had a common frontier with its erstwhile colonizer. This is why no support should be denied the Secretary-General in order that he might take all the measures necessary to ensure free  regular and democratic elections for the genuine independence of that country.International economic relations today remain profoundly inequitable and place upon the weaker economies numerous and increasingly untenable constraints. The developing countries  in their desire to broaden the North-South dialogue  had our General Assembly adopt two basic documents: first  the Declaration and Programme of Action on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order; and secondly  the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States. These two texts were intended to serve as a framework and as guidance in international economic co-operation. Although these documents had been adopted by a double consensus in the General Assembly  that was not sufficient to impose the necessary reforms on the international economic system which they contained. Thus  in particular  the targets set for the Third United Nations Development Decade are today very far from having been reached.During the 1980s the disruption of commodity prices  the steady deterioration in the terms of trade  the growth in protectionism  the inevitable rise of debt and the general shrinkage of financial flows to the developing countries have resulted in the latter's finding themselves in a vicious circle which they find it difficult to break out of. In the middle of the present decade  average real commodity prices had reached the lowest level ever recorded since the great depression of the 1930s. The African countries  which are heavily dependent on their primary exports  have been Particularly hard hit by the drop in world prices  in 1987-1988 the prices of cocoa  copper  wood  iron and so forth were more than 30 per cent lower than those in 1980. Earnings from these commodities correspondingly fell at a time when our countries  faced with ever increasing and more urgent social demands and economic constraints  continued to founder in a state of chronic and absurd indebtedness. Today this external debt has taken such a place in the concerns of states that it is concealing the real problems of development in the third world. Undoubtedly specific measures have recently been taken by States and institutions to alleviate the burden of debt of a number of countries in the third world  and here we should like to express our profound gratitude to those countries which  in an upsurge of solidarity  have waived either totally or partially the public credits they held in the case of Togo.Nevertheless it must be emphasized that solution of the crisis of indebtedness necessarily involves raising the value of commodities. if the developing countries do not receive remunerative prices for their commodities they will very shortly reach a situation of profound disequilibrium that must lead to the crippling indebtedness which we deplore so much today. Indeed  as long as there is a reverse flow of resources and as long as external financial flows do not increase substantially towards the poor countries of the third world  those countries will be doomed to stagnation and to impoverishment.The developed and the developing countries should mobilize their efforts both in thought and deed so that in a fresh spirit of solidarity new solutions can be found not only to the debt problem but  more generally  to ensure the specific implementation of the measures adopted  first by the General Assembly  such as the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  and  secondly  by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the other agencies of the United Nations system.It is very important now to rethink international economic co-operation in terms of a judicious restructuring of the world economic order. That is why my country attaches major importance to two forthcoming events  namely  the special session of the General Assembly to further economic growth and development  and the drawing up of a new international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade. Both events should provide an opportunity to remedy the inequities of the international economic system end to promote a just and equitable division of the heritage of mankind. The detente that we are now experiencing will be fragile and precarious if it does not have a specific economic content for the developing countries  that is to say  new and real possibilities for development and progress.Similarly  international co-operation must be strengthened in the matter of the protection of the environment. Overt or covert attempts to bury toxic wastes in Africa could ultimately result in sowing death  desolation and squalor among our peoples. That is why we must join our efforts and bear in mind that the struggle to prevent the deterioration of the environment is an integral part of what should be done by the international community to promote economic growth and development.In order to thwart these nefarious manoeuvres  the Government of Togo in the matter of the protection of the environment has drawn up a code that is stringent both in the standards it defines and the sanctions it lays down.The same stringency and intransigence should be observed with regard to the Production of  trafficking in  and consumption of drugs - a scourge whose effects will in the final analysis be lethal for all societies  whether rich or poor.Likewise  the acts of terrorism perpetrated here and there  whether carried out by organized groups or isolated individuals  should be firmly condemned and fought against unflaggingly. Absolutely nothing can excuse the loss of innocent life for causes which would be better served by open and constructive dialogue  even if that dialogue is difficult to achieve.The growing interdependence among the various participants on the international scene is today a reality none can evade.In the same way that political tensions  poverty and squalor are becoming more generalized  economic and social difficulties and the unrelenting deterioration of the environment are threatening the capacity of States fully to enjoy their national and international sovereignty and thus to make an effective contribution to the advent of a world of peace. Like conflicts  natural catastrophes and the depletion of financial resources that is linked to massive external indebtedness may seriously undermine the independence and sovereignty of States and  hence  their security and international peace.During the decade that is coming to and end  we have witnessed a number of grey areas in our joint efforts to promote the well-being of our peoples and to give concrete expression to the ideals of justice  freedom and solidarity. That is why it is important for us to work even harder to impart full vitality and urgency to the concept of solidarity  which is at the crossroads of the major moral and spiritual values that can give our world new reasons for living and making progress together. It is in this way that the forthcoming decade can be one of renewal  that is  a time when we shall come to realize fully that we share a common destiny so that the twenty-first century may usher in a more peaceful world  a world that is more secure and more favourable to the further blossoming of mankind in every aspect."
"136",6785,"THA",44,1989,"ï»¿On behalf of the Thai delegation  permit me to extend to Ambassador Garba our warmest congratulations on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His recognized wisdom  proven diplomatic skill and strong dedication will undoubtedly contribute to the successful work of this Assembly at an important juncture in the life of the United Nations. We are grateful to Nigeria and  indeed  to Africa for providing us with the services of one of its most distinguished sons.Permit me also to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Dante M. Caputo  President of the forty-third session  for the leadership  dedication and wisdom he has shot over the past year.May I also extend our warm felicitations to all the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly. While representing the different regions of the world  they also reflect the universality of the United Nations.Developments over the past year enable me to maintain a high degree of hope and optimism. Twelve months ago  I stood here at this podium and welcomed a new and more encouraging trend in international affairs: a trend towards peace and accommodation; a trend towards co-operation and consensus among the permanent members of the Security Council; a trend towards what I called ""a new world order of peace and justice"". It is a trend that I believe continues to be discernible.But it is also clear that numerous and substantial tasks remain before us.Detente and relaxation of tensions among the major Powers have not been translated in all cases into resolution of outstanding regional and global issues. In many cases  what is urgently required is a more active intervention on the part of an impartial international body such as the United Nations. The time is ripe for the United Nations to act with increased vigour. We should not let the opportunity provided by a more favourable international environment pass us by.The dream of a free Namibia needs to be realized with the full implementation of the United Nations plan for the Independence; of Namibia. The return to Namibia  after 30 years of exile  of Mr. Sam Nujoma  the courageous nationalist  augurs well and should be a positive step for peace in that country. Sadly  no significant progress has been made in neighbouring South Africa. The bankrupt policy of apartheid continues. We have spoken in outrage of this inhuman policy and system. We have condemned it in this and other forums. The United Nations must continue to press Pretoria to make the necessary transition  by focusing attention on the issue and by maintaining political and economic pressure. We can only hope that reason and good sense will prevail soon enough to avert the tragedy waiting to occur in South Africa.In the Middle East  the question of Palestine also remains unresolved. The Palestine Liberation Organization's acceptance of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) was a major step forward. Yet peace is not at hand. The inalienable rights of the Palestinians are still being denied. The intifadah is a manifestation of the struggle for freedom that continues unabated in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza.The overwhelming majority of members of this Assembly have made clear what needs to be accomplished. The foundation for a possible solution has been established with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) as well as other Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and decisions. Let these serve as guidelines towards an eventual settlement of this problem  which for too long has held back peace in the Middle East.Earlier this morning  I listened with great interest to President Mubarak's speech. My delegation was encouraged by recent developments which have helped to produce conditions favourable for the launching of dialogue between the Palestinians and the Israelis without pre-conditions. My delegation wishes also to express the earnest hope that this proposed dialogue will lead to a ""converging perception of steps which would pave the way for peace and for overall agreement on conditions for a comprehensive settlement"". Furthermore  Thailand has always supported the convening of an international peace conference as part of this process in order that a final comprehensive political settlement can be achieved  paving the way to a durable peace in this important region of the world.As we look north from Palestine  we see the continuation of another conflict  one that has caused so much suffering and so many deaths. For so many years  members of the international community have tried hard  but in vain  to end the bloodshed in Lebanon. A political solution through national reconciliation is desperately needed in Lebanon.I welcome the Arab League Committee's announcement of 16 September proposing a new peace plan for Lebanon. My delegation hopes that all the parties concerned  including the United Nations itself  will join the Arab League in working for the immediate termination of the hostilities that have gone on for far too long in Lebanon.Closer to home  developments concerning the Korean Peninsula continue to be very important to the question of peace and stability in north-east Asia. For this reason  the unification initiative by President Roh Tae Wco deserves serious consideration. Furthermore  we would welcome any move by the Koreans to join this Organization if they so desired  for we believe in the principle of universality of membership in the United Nations.In my delegation's immediate part of the world  the question of Kampuchea also remains unresolved. The General Assembly has for 10 years laid down guidelines for the restoration of peace and security in that war-torn country  but thus far  diplomatic efforts within and outside the Organization have proved insufficient. The two Jakarta Informal Meetings convened over the past year were significant regional efforts. The Paris International Conference on Cambodia in August helped the parties and participants concerned to come to grips with the complex technical problems and difficult political issues. My own Government has attempted to maintain informal dialogues with the Kampuchean parties concerned to avert large-scale hostilities. But peace remains elusive.Only a political settlement of the Kampuchean problem in a comprehensive manner can assure a return to peace and order in that country. A solution which addresses only one or two out of the multitude of aspects for a comprehensive settlement will invite prolonged hostilities and impose further hardship on the Kampucheans.My delegation notes the announced withdrawal of foreign troops from Kampuchea. But in the absence of United Nations supervision  control and verification  we are unable to be confident that all the foreign troops have left. And indeed  the reality on the ground at present appears to be one of intensified fighting.My delegation believes that it is crucial and most pragmatic for the United Nations to be intimately involved in the implementation of any peace plan for Kampuchea. The institutional expertise and long experience of the United Nations are universally acknowledged  especially in the area of peace-keeping and in the preparations for  and supervision of  free  fair and democratic elections. The same applies to the repatriation of the half million Kampuchean refugees and displaced persons. A central role for the United Nations in reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts for Kampuchea will also be vitally important.Let me now turn to the problem of refugees in South-East Asia. Refugees and displaced persons from Kampuchea  Laos and Viet Nam remain a humanitarian problem of some magnitude. For this reason  my delegation recalls with much satisfaction the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees  convened in Geneva by the Secretary-General this past June. The Declaration and the Comprehensive Plan of Action adopted at that Conference contain much-needed and timely guidelines for coping with this problem in an all-embracing and balanced manner by all who are directly concerned within the region and beyond. It was good work. I commend all who participated and made it possible to arrive at the conclusion we reached. The co-operation of the international community is still essential and  it is hoped  will he forthcoming at the levels required.Let me move from problems of the various regions to problems that affect all of us without exception on this planet. The first among these is the continuing build-up of conventional  nuclear and chemical weapons. Billions upon billions of dollars continue to be channelled to developing and deploying armaments. The major Powers among us now have instruments capable of destroying this planet many times over.A reduction of a mere 2 per cent of these expenditures by major Powers would yield upwards of at least $200 billion a year in resources for peaceful development purposes. This is four times more than the total amount of resources available in the world for development today. Such a small reduction in the defence budgets of the major Powers in the armaments field cannot possibly nullify their military capability to defend themselves. But the resources that could be diverted to development purposes would help redress economic imbalances and mitigate some of the causes of regional conflicts.With this in mind  my delegation welcomes the report of progress made in the disarmament talks between the United States and the Soviet Union. My delegation hopes that progress in bilateral negotiations will be complemented by progress in multilateral negotiations. This week  from this same podium  the President of the United states and the Soviet Foreign Minister made important proposals on the subject of chemical weapons. We welcome both proposals as significant initiatives marking a major step towards the global elimination of all types of chemical weapons.Another problem which affects all of us on this planet as we approach the beginning of the twenty-first century is the environment - our common environment. How well mankind may survive into the next century depends upon how well we preserve and conserve the Earth's environment. The list of serious environmental problems grows ever longer. We pollute the air we breathe  the water we drink  the soil we till. We let loose chemicals that puncture holes in the ozone layer  and we dump our dangerous unwanted toxic wastes upon one another. At this rate  we cannot hope to pass on to posterity the environmental heritage entrusted to us by preceding generations of humanity. I am pleased to share with the Assembly my Government's own modest efforts addressed in our current national economic and social development plan. Logging concessions have been revoked. Urgent measures are being made in reforestation throughout the Kingdom. We have also designated 1989 as the Year of Natural Resources Preservation and Environmental Protection. We will intensify public- awareness of environmental issues.But environmental issues cannot be successfully tackled by single nations or even groups of nations. They require the universal support and efforts that can be marshalled only by the United Nations. We must devise common strategies to combat these pressing problems at the national  regional and international levels. Our common strategies must be based on full awareness of these problems and dangers. My delegation is pleased that the environment is now receiving the broad interest of this world body.It is fitting and urgently necessary that environmental protection should also be at the top of the regional development agenda. For this reason  my delegation commends the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) for its proposed convening of a ministerial-level conference on the environment for Asia and the Pacific in 1990. We will encourage this conference to produce practical guidelines and measures for immediate implementation. This conference should serve as an important step towards the convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. My delegation welcomes Brazil's generous offer to host that important conference.Another problem of grave concern and magnitude that threatens us all because it recognizes no boundaries is drugs. Drugs are insidious and lethal-  insidious because of the greed they inspire in those who would prey upon us lethal because drugs completely destroy not only the individuals  but also the society of which their individuals are a part. We support those who have declared a war on drugs because war is what it takes to combat and to vanquish this menace.National efforts are essential and international co-operation and co-ordination are crucial in a total war on drugs. The United Nations convention on this issue adopted in December 1988 points the way towards more effective and comprehensive international efforts. But eradication of this menace cannot succeed if the demand for illicit drugs continues to beckon the supply. Social aid cultural dimensions of the problem at both the demand and the supply ends must be addressed.I have spoken of global problems that we all share because the Assembly is the most appropriate forum in which to discuss them. They are problems that threaten us and our survival. I have spoken of the need to work as one to tackle them. There is an underlying interdependence we all share. Interdependence has been the driving philosophy of this House. In one major aspect of international life the critical importance of interdependence needs to be further underlined. This is in the economic and the development fields.My country and most of those within my region believe in an open multilateral trading system. We have been more fortunate than some in our ability to obtain the kind of growth and development we have today. The countries in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are our partners. So now are the Pacific Rim countries. Together we hope to spur growth and development for the Asia and the Pacific area as a whole. We see this expanded regional co-operation as a means to promote a multilateral trading system which is outward-looking and in harmony with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).Through our regional efforts my delegation hopes to achieve a unanimity of understanding that a free and open multilateral trading system is mutually beneficial over the long term and that  in contrast  protectionism is harmful to all our common inter eats. If those basic objectives could be achieved  perhaps the international community could be on the way towards easing debt and other economic problems. For those reasons my delegation has attached great importance to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations and  through it  the promotion of trade liberalization.In addition  there are other economic problems that must be addressed as well  These include trade imbalances  the fluctuation of exchange rates  depressed commodity prices and the net transfer of financial resources from developing countries. On all those issues unilateral measures will not suffice. Political will  international co-operation and constructive dialogue are required to effect the necessary structural changes.Here again the role of the General Assembly is a beneficial one. In its wisdom the Assembly has decided to focus the world's attention on these pressing problems at a special session on international economic co-operation in 1990. There are also special categories of countries that need special attention within the framework of the United Nations. For this reason the Second Conference on the Least Developed Countries next year also has my delegation's full support and endorsement.As we look down the road towards the end of this century and the beginning of the next  I am convinced that we could be on the threshold of an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. International co-operation and understanding are the key components of any strategy to reach these goals. In such a strategy I see the United Nations as an indispensable instrument and our deliberations here as the necessary catalyst. I also see the role of the Secretary-General as crucial in these common endeavours. Under the leadership of our Secretary-General the Organization has made a difference. Under him it has become even more relevant to our lives. I wish the President of the Assembly great success in overseeing the important work that lies before us. At the end of this forty-fourth session I trust we shall be one step closer to the goals of peace and prosperity we seek for all mankind."
"137",6901,"TTO",44,1989,"ï»¿It is with considerable pleasure that I extend to you  Mr. President  on behalf of the Government and the people of Trinidad and Tobago  our warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. We are heartened that a diplomat and negotiator as skilful  adept and experienced as yourself  representing a country with which Trinidad and Tobago maintains very warm and friendly relations  will usher this Organization into the decade of the 1990s - a period not only of much hope and promise  but also of innumerable challenges. My delegation is confident that you are more than equal to the task.I also take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  on his able stewardship of the General Assembly at its forty-third session and on the effective manner in which he discharged his important responsibilities.It is indeed gratifying that the fiftieth anniversary of the cataclysmic conflict that led to the establishment of the United Nations should coincide with a renewal of faith and confidence in the capacity of the world Organization to resolve conflicts and to maintain international peace and security. The Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has underlined this welcome trend in his excellent report on the work of the Organization.A number of reasons explain this profound change in attitude to the United Nations. The retreat from the bloc politics of the cold war era and the rapprochement between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have created an improved international climate. This has in great part allayed the mutual fears and suspicions of the two super-Powers which  over the preceding years  had neutralized all attempts by the United Nations to carry out the functions for which it had been created. There is another  perhaps more important reason  however. It is the belated recognition by the major players on the international scene of the severe limitations placed on their ability to resolve problems unilaterally. Power and influence are now diffused among a multiplicity of States  all of which must take into account the complex web of interlocking interests spun by an increasingly interdependent world. The re-emergence of consensus between the super-Powers and the resurgence of multilateralism  two of the key mechanisms in the Charter  can only redound to the benefit of the United Nations and of the entire international community. Recent developments in the field of disarmament reflect this clearly.In the context of the re-emergence of consensus  the expressed desire of the United States and the Soviet Union to work towards the elimination of chemical weapons is a promising advance on their earlier agreement with respect to intermediate and shorter-range missiles. Recent experience in regional conflicts makes it imperative that a multilateral convention be concluded to effect the total elimination of chemical weapons from the armouries of all States. Such a convention  an objective of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament  must include prohibitions on the production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons.The improved international climate and a keener perception of the increasingly burdensome costs entailed in pursuing long-stalemated conflicts have led to positive developments in a number of regional disputes. Agreements and understandings have been concluded and in some cases implemented  and mechanisms have been established to facilitate conciliation and to enhance support for international law. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is therefore encouraged to conclude that we are entering a period in International relations that is replete with opportunities which. If approached cautiously and with a clear understanding of the many complex factors involved  may be exploited to the benefit of all.The example of Namibia comes readily to mind here. I wish to express my Government's appreciation for the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-General and his staff to implement the agreed United Nations plan to bring independence to Namibia. We wish  however  to express our deep concern over the blatant attempts by the apartheid regime  through its Administrator-General  to frustrate the electoral process set out in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) by intimidation and by distortion of the registration process. South Africa must not obtain by devious means what It could not achieve by naked force. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago is therefore of the view that greater vigilance must be exercised by both the supervising authorities and the international community. The implementation of the United Nations plan to bring independence to Namibia must not be disrupted by the duplicity  delaying tactics and intimidation of the apartheid regime.The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has demonstrated recently its commitment to the emergence of an independent Namibia by acceding to a request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the provision of a group of suitably qualified persons to assist in preparations for the forthcoming general elections in that country. My Government stands ready to render such further assistance as may be feasible to facilitate the successful completion of the independence process in Namibia.Despite the progress in Namibia  apartheid still exists in neighbouring South Africa. We are of the view that the recent changing of the guard in the apartheid regime could create  with enlightened self-interest and political courage  a window of opportunity in the embattled apartheid laager. However  this will not be achieved by the sop of  evolutionary change  advocated by the new leader of the minority regime who  despite conflicting signals  does not promise to yield power to the majority. Bold and courageous steps are now required to satisfy the deep-seated aspirations of the majority of the people of South Africa. These will include the lifting of the state of emergency end the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners from a futile  inhumane and counter-productive incarceration. These steps would facilitate the commencement of a genuine dialogue with the leaders of the majority with a view to bringing about meaningful change leading to the emergence of a non-racial  democratic  id united South Africa.Trinidad and Tobago remains firm  steadfast and unrelenting in its total denunciation of apartheid and reiterates its complete support for the people of South Africa in their struggle to eradicate this vicious scourge. As long as the system of apartheid is practised is South Africa  Trinidad and Tobago will continue to prohibit economic  cultural  sporting and other links with that country. My Government is conscious that individual action will not by itself suffice to dismantle the system of apartheid. Accordingly  Trinidad and Tobago once more appeals to those States which wield influence on the leadership of the South African regime to support all international measures aimed at ending this heinous and odious system  including the imposition of comprehensive  mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Such concerted and resolute action  we are convinced  is the only way forward.Trinidad and Tobago also welcomes the decision taken by the General Assembly to devote a special session in December this year to the issue of apartheid. The need for such a session has been made even more urgent by the most recent events in South Africa  especially the terrible murder of 22 unarmed black people shot in a so-called crackdown on anti-apartheid dissent and the staging of manifestly unrepresentative elections on 6 September  which again excluded the African majority. The continued existence of apartheid remains a source of profound outrage to Trinidad and Tobago and  as representatives will agree  to the international community.It is unfortunate that in the Middle East some of the opportunities created by the thaw in super-Power relations are being allowed to slip away. Inertia and the obstinate yearning for unrealistic goals are snuffing out the faint hopes which had begun to stir a year ago with the momentum generated by the decisions of the Palestine National Council and the commencement of a dialogue between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the United States of America. All the peace initiatives undertaken have been aborted  while the blood-letting and repression continue in the occupied territories. My Government remains convinced that the convening of an international peace conference is still the best means of achieving peace  based on respect for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and for the right of all parties concerned to exist in peace and security.Tragically  in Lebanon the situation is worsening and the agony of the Lebanese people continues. The international community looks on despairingly as the long-suffering Lebanese communities are further decimated by indiscriminate artillery barrages. My Government joins others in calling on the parties to the Lebanese conflict to end this senseless terror. All countries in a position to influence that situation should and must redouble their efforts to bring those disputes to peaceful resolution. In this context  Trinidad and Tobago welcomes the recent initiative of the Arab League to bring about a cease-fire.Recent developments in other parts of the world serve to further reinforce the urgent need for political solutions through negotiations involving all the parties concerned. In Afghanistan the withdrawal of foreign troops has been followed by an escalation in the fighting. This has complicated  as representatives will appreciate  the search for a peaceful resolution of the dispute.With regard to Kampuchea the unmonitored withdrawal of foreign troops has been followed by the threat of an escalation in the fighting. This aggravates the sense of disquiet which resulted from the inconclusive Paris Conference. My Government hopes that the Co-Chairmen of the Paris Conference will be successful in having the diplomatic process resumed. We are also heartened by the Secretary-General intention to continue exercising his good offices to bring an end to this impasse.In the Korean peninsula  my Government hopes that the dialogue between the two Koreas will continue. Trinidad and Tobago looks forward to the early entry of the Koreas as full Members of the United Nations  in keeping with the principle of universality of membership  which we fully support.The relaxation of international tensions and the increased recourse to multilateral processes have facilitated a growing use of regional initiatives to resolve regional disputes. It is in that context of multilateral participation that Trinidad and Tobago  a small State; has been called upon to play an active role in regional attempts to further peace and stability in our own regime. Along with Ecuador and Guatemala  Trinidad and Tobago has been a member of the Mission of the Organization of American States (OAS) to Panama. That Mission has sought  in consultation with the Government and people of Panama  to assist in resolving the political crisis in that country by developing options and mechanisms to facilitate the establishment of a democratically elected government.My Government warmly welcomes the initiatives being taken to bring true and lasting peace to Central America. In this regard  we commend the efforts of the Presidents of Costa Rica  El Salvador  Guatemala  Honduras and Nicaragua. The processes and procedures outlined by the Contadora Group and the more recent Esquiipulas II and Tela agreements point the way forward to national reconciliation and the restoration of social and political stability in the region. The crucial aspect of this process will be the forthcoming general elections in Nicaragua  which must be free and fair. In this regard also  my Government was honoured by the invitation of the Secretary-General of the OAS to such officials to observe the registration of voters  a request to which we have readily responded.As Members know  Haiti enjoys a special place in Caribbean history and consciousness as the first independent nation in our region. As a result of its history and language  the natural links between the English-speaking Caribbean and Haiti have not yet been fully developed. Nevertheless  we in the Caribbean Community have keenly felt Haiti's pain. Consequently  at the invitation of the Government of Haiti  Trinidad and Tobago have once again participated in a fact-finding mission mounted by the Caribbean Community to that country. The recent announcement of an electoral timetable raises our hopes that the Government and people of Haiti will move unchecked towards the establishment t of a free and democratic society. In this context  it becomes even more urgent for theinternational community to provide the necessary assistance to alleviate the suffering of the Haitian people.The point has been made in the past from this rostrum and in many other international forums that the degree of confidence placed in multilateral processes is most often in inverse proportion to the size of the State. Like many other small States in the international community  Trinidad and Tobago views the United Nations as one of the guarantors of its sovereignty and independence and as the roost effective and capable mechanism for promoting peace and security among Member States. Regional bodies such as the OAS and the Caribbean Community play a similarly important role.Trinidad and Tobago also strongly holds the view that small States  normally without significant political  economic and military influence  must endeavour by their conduct to be a moral force  to serve in some sense as the conscience of the international community. Indeed  my Government has noted with keen interest that over the past year several small States have been able to make a tangible contribution to the preservation of international peace and security. As mentioned earlier  Trinidad and Tobago  a member of the Caribbean Community  has been asked to play such a role  as evidenced by our involvement in Panama  Nicaragua  Namibia and Haiti. It is to be hoped that this positive trend will continue - for small States  and particularly when acting in concert  do have a worthwhile contribution to make in this area  not only by their example  but also as honest brokers. Today  as we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century  there is as yet no prospect of a new equilibrium in international economic relations that would facilitate the emergence of a community of interests and of shared concerns and responsibilities. The critical economic situation of most developing countries worsens as the inequities in the global distribution of wealth grow sharper and even more pronounced. Prices of primary commodities continue to fluctuate at disastrously low levels; the terms of trade of developing countries as a whole have deteriorated; and heavy external debt severely hampers development initiatives. For many of us the momentum of development that was gained in the 1960s and the 1970s has been lost. Indeed  the 1980s have come to be termed the lost decade of development.In Latin America and the Caribbean  per-capita income for the region as a whole now remains below the level of 1980. Trinidad and Tobago  confronted by handicaps arising from the interplay of the specific problems of small-island developing countries and the problems facing the developing world in general  experienced its sixth consecutive year of negative growth in 1988. The majority of developing countries in other regions also experienced declining per-capita output.Is it not ironic that negative growth in the developing world has been accompanied by an economic upswing in the developed economies  which entered a record-breaking seventh year of growth in 1988? Indeed  all developed market economies have experienced more rapid growth than was expected. Despite these favourable trends in the developed world  the multilateral trading system has been subjected to considerable strain  and barriers to trade have continued to proliferate  in spite of the pious commitment made at Punta del Este. The Uruguay Round presents the international community with an opportunity to repair and strengthen the international trading system  to ensure that trade is kept free of impediments and that countries avoid recourse to protectionist devices. These devices  I should add  are particularly harmful to enterprises and countries of the South.It is for that reason that developing countries have stressed that the Uruguay Round must deal with issues of traditional concern  particularly those  such as the questionable use of safeguards and non-tariff barriers  that relate to the restriction of access to markets. Substantial progress must be achieved in these areas before attention is directed to the so-called new issues. It is our hope that the future negotiations will be more transparent and imbued with a spirit of co-operation and compromise that will cater equitably for the interests of both the industrialized and the developing countries.For many developing countries the Problems of external debt and debt-servicing remain the major impediment to long-term growth and sustainable development. Unchecked  the continued ravages of this crisis would relegate many countries to a future of hopelessness.There is emerging within the international community an awareness that the problem of external debt must be urgently addressed. This awareness  however  has not yet been translated into consensus for a comprehensive solution that will command the support of all the parties involved. It is our view that debt strategies employed thus far have been too selective in their scope and application and have focused little attention on small  middle-income countries  like Trinidad and Tobago. I can assure the Assembly that we too feel  in equal measure  the pain Inflicted by external debt  debt-servicing and structural adjustment. The need for a solution to the problem of external debt is critical for yet another reason. The massive external debt and the cost of servicing it  aggravated at times by volatile interest rates have created a perverse situation where there is a net transfer of resources to the industrialized countries of the world. In Latin America and the Caribbean this reverse flow has been particularly burdensome. The United Nations itself has estimated that since 1983 the region has been transferring abroad annually nearly one fifth of its export earning s or gross domestic product.This outflow is taking place simultaneously with the stagnation of concessional resources  the global decrease in the flow of foreign direct investment to developing countries  and the virtual cessation of lending to developing countries by the commercial-banking sector. In these circumstances there must be serious economic distortion.The international community must address this problem urgently. Any strategy for the developing countries  in the next decade and beyond  must be based on the promise of access to adequate financial resources. Such strategies must  as a matter of priority  redirect resources and surplus savings in the world economy towards the developing countries  where there exists a vast need for investment flows to foster growth and sustainable development.The interrelated nature of the problems faced by all countries indicates that international co-operation is crucial to their resolution. In this context the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  the World Bank and other multilateral financial institutions in the international economy is vital. The IMF and the World Bank must direct their efforts  resources and influence towards the evolution if a more equitable world economy and towards the cause of growth and sustainable development in the developing countries. Several major economic conference during the course of this year have again affirmed the necessity for countries of the North and of the South to engage in a broad-based dialogue on issues that affect their relations. Trinidad and Tobago therefore welcomes the decision to convene  in 1990  a special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation and  in particular  to the revitalisation of the process of economic growth and development in the developing countries. This special session will present a timely opportunity to arrive at political decisions aimed at achieving effective collective action in the interrelated areas of money  finance  trade  external debt and development. It is our fervent hope that the special session will facilitate the preparation and adoption of a widely heralded international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade.The rapid advances in science and technology  and their immediate application to all spheres of activity  are having a profound impact on the social and economic evolution of all societies. It is therefore especially unfortunate that one of the results of the economic regression that has afflicted developing countries in the 1980s is the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries in the acquisition and utilisation of technology  The simple truth is that technology is critical to growth and development. There is therefore an urgent need to devise appropriate mechanisms to increase the transfer of technology to developing countries  to strengthen their indigenous capabilities in science and technology  and to do so on terms and conditions to which the developing countries can readily subscribe. It is for that reason that Trinidad and Tobago is disappointed with the slow rate of progress in the effort to elaborate and conclude the international code of conduct on the transfer of technology. This code will address the rights  responsibilities and obligations of its signatories and provide a framework within which technological exchanges can take place for the benefit of both the provider and the recipient. I therefore urge all involved in the negotiations to let their deliberations be guided not by narrow self-interest  but by a vision of the larger benefits that will accrue to all patties as a result of the completion and implementation of the code.Protection of the environment is another area where the destinies of the developed and developing nations are closely intertwined. Desertification  soil erosion and deforestation combine with the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere and effluents into the water systems to destroy the ecosystems of our planet. Sadly  attempts to dump toxic waste from developed to developing countries have added a disturbing dimension to environmental degradation.Environmental problems do not respect national boundaries. Consequently  individual country programmes for the roost part will do very little to solve these problems. The need therefore is for concerted  regional and international approaches to combat this crisis. He in the Caribbean have recognized this and Caribbean Ministers of Environment met earlier this year and agreed upon the Port-of-Spain Accord  which maps out a co-ordinated programme for the preservation of our environment. Pot us in the Caribbean  the preservation of the environment is especially Important since it forms the cradle of our tourist industry  the dynamic sector in the economic life of many of our countries. It is against this background that Trinidad and Tobago supports the convening of the proposed United Nations conference on environment and development  to take place no later than 1992. The recent passage of hurricane Hugo has again demonstrated the vulnerability of the Caribbean islands to natural disasters. We extend our sympathy to those who were affected by the hurricane as it wove its way through the islands of the Caribbean to the eastern seaboard of the United States of America. The task of rebuilding will be formidable. Caribbean States responded immediately  providing assistance within the limits of their capabilities. Trinidad and Tobago today urges the international community to assist generously in this process of reconstruction.It is evident from the way in which the international economic system is being reshaped as the twentieth century draws to a close that the survival of small island developing countries will become increasingly precarious unless they too can group themselves into stronger economic units.The advent of a single European market in 1992 and the recently introduced Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the United States will have a very significant effect on Trinidad and Tobago and on its neighbours in the Caribbean Community (CARIOGM)  for these countries are our biggest trading partners. It was with this in mind  and in anticipation of other similar changes in the global economy  that the Heads of CARI OOM Governments  at their 10th meeting last July  in Grenada  adopted the Grand Anse Declaration and work Programme for the Advancement of the Integration Movement. The Declaration contains a range of specific and far-reaching initiatives which are to be implemented over the next four years and which will serve to accelerate the integration process and strengthen all dimensions of the Community.We in Trinidad and Tobago have always recognized that our destiny is inextricably linked to that of our sister States in the Caribbean. Our own efforts at integration pre-date our independence  and over the last 20 years we have gradually but steadily worked towards deepening our integration movement and making our Community and common market a reality. It will readily be appreciated that the process of Caribbean integration has not been easy  given the lack of complementarities of our economies. Nevertheless  the member States of CAR 100*4 are demonstrating the necessary political will  determination and realism needed to achieve it.The use of  and traffic in  illegal drugs has emerged as a major problem affecting the international community. This plague corrodes the very fabric of our societies. It has the potential to frustrate  subvert and in some cases render impotent the actions of elected Governments. Recent developments in Latin America have demonstrated  under the horrified gaze of the entire world community  the tremendous threat posed by those individuals and entities who deal in degradation and death represented by illegal drugs.The Secretary-General has pointed out in his annual report that the monetary value of drug trafficking has recently surpassed that of the international trade in oil and is new second only to the arms trade. It is a searing commentary on contemporary international priorities that while many countries struggle with malnutrition  disease and a host of economic and social problems  the trade in illegal drugs and arms stands at the pinnacle of international commerce.The Caribbean  positioned as we are and lacking the human and material resources for interdict drug traffickers  has become a natural pathway for illegal drugs bound for the lucrative markets of North America and Europe. Caribbean governments are thus faced with a unique challenge  more so since they are unable to match financial and other resources with the powerful drug cartels.For Trinidad and Tobago  and for all of us in the Caribbean  international co-operation is the only viable option. For this reason  my country supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly to deal with the issue of illicit drug trafficking. The international community must declare war on this illicit trade. The battle  however  cannot be fought only in the fields of Latin America or on the shores of the Caribbean islands. The battle must also be waged with vigour and determination on the streets of the consumer nations. International co-operation therefore should focus not only on interdiction but also on demand reduction. It must also place greater emphasis on treatment and rehabilitation for those unfortunate members of our societies who have fallen victim to the lure of illicit drugs.After careful consideration  we in the Caribbean have placed proposals before the Assembly on the question of the international trade in illegal drugs. Michael Manley  Prime Minister of Jamaica  has proposed the establishment of a United Nations multilateral  multi-sectoral force which would provide assistance to States  on their request  in the areas of intelligence and interdiction. We commend this proposal to the General Assembly for favourable consideration during this session.For our part  on the basis of a proposal by Mr. A. N. R. Robinson  Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago  my delegation has introduced a new item to the agenda of the General Assembly. The item calls for the establishment of an international criminal court which would be a judicial institution operating with the agreement of states in the international community and which would adjudicate en the criminal responsibility of the individuals Who contravene international law. The jurisdiction of such a court would be limited to those crimes that may be defined as international crimes on the basis of identified principles of international law. The international traffic in illegal drugs has joined genocide  war ÑÐ³1ÑÑÐ· and acts of terrorism as offences that affect the entire international community and the peaceful conduct of international relations. Regrettably  domestic legal systems are often overburdened or  in some cases  inadequate to deal with the perpetrators of such offences  while it is true that modern technology and the communications revolution make the control of international crime possible  it has become palpably clear that no State acting on its own can successfully defeat international criminals.Trinidad and Tobago is a party to the non-aligned initiative for the 1990s to be declared the decade of international law. We believe that the establishment of an international criminal court would constitute an important impetus to the codification and progressive development of international law during the decade. Trinidad and Tobago's proposal has been introduced in the Sixth Committee at this session of the Assembly  and we hope that it will receive the full support of Member States.Forty-four years ago the founders of this Organization  representing the collective conscience of peoples that had emerged battered and exhausted from the Second World War  saw the United Nations as the only hope to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Since that time we have made significant strides. But in some areas we have fallen short.Recent events seem to indicate  however  that the international community may be entering a new and more peaceful era. If this promise of peace is to be realized  then Member States will have to give even greater support to the United Nations  particularly as its role in the resolution of conflicts and peace-keeping increases. For it is only in such an environment that all countries can pursue and implement programmes and policies leading to their full growth and development.It is therefore incumbent on us all to display the political will  the imagination and the compassion necessary to transmute opportunity into reality. Together we can then fashion a future which will guarantee the dignity and worth of the human person and provide a solid foundation for a new architecture of the world."
"138",6947,"TUN",44,1989,"ï»¿It is my great pleasure to convey to Ambassador Garba  on behalf of the Tunisian Republic delegation  my sincere congratulations on his election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. Through this election the international community has expressed its deep appreciation and admiration for his brotherly country  Nigeria  aid the African continent at large has acknowledged its prominent standing on the international scene. We are fully confident that his great diplomatic skills  wide experience in international natters  and deep knowledge of the functioning of the United Nations  where he has so ably represented his country for many years  guarantee the success of our work at this session. On this occasion I should like to state again our readiness to co-operate closely with him throughout his term at the helm of this session.My warmest thanks go as well to his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Worship of the friendly Republic of Argentina  for the great wisdom and competence with which he conducted the work of the last session and for his positive contributions to the activities of the United Nations during his term as President of the General Assembly. It is also my pleasant duty to express our warm appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the invaluable services he has rendered and continues to render in the efforts to attain the goals of our prestigious Organization  based on the principle of universality. In bringing its noble principles to bear on international relations he is serving the cause of freedom  justice and peace in the world. The success achieved by the United Nations in moving gradually towards peaceful solutions of most of the regional conflicts is to a large extent the result of the wisdom  patience and perseverance of the Secretary-General. His efforts deserve our praise aid appreciation.Tunisia  which has constantly benefited from the support of the United Nations and the Security Council  both in its struggle for independence and in its defence of its sovereignty and territorial integrity  once again affirms its deep attachment to the Organization and its firm commitment to the purposes and principles set out in the Charter. Tunisia confirms that it will dedicate itself whole-heartedly to work for the attainment of the ideals of the United Nations both in the area of its international relations and in the line of action it has set for itself after the historic change that took place in our country on 7 November 1987. At the national level  these ideals and principles have become a living fact of our everyday life  as is clear from the deeply rooted  comprehensive institutional and political changes we have made in order to consolidate individual and collective rights; promote freedom  democracy and tolerance; aid build a society based on national harmony and social peace.The National Pact drawn up and adopted by all political parties and currents in the country constitutes a remarkable achievement. Suitable conditions were established for the rapid holding of presidential aid legislative elections  on the basis of democracy  pluralism and freedom of expression. These elections gave the Tunisian people  at all social levels  the opportunity of rallying round the architect of the event of 7 November 1987 - President Zine A1 Abidine Ben Ali - aid freely to elect a house of representatives truly reflecting its choices and its will.Above all  the people chose to engage in a constant endeavour to reassert our Arab-Islamic identity and to consolidate our civilization and cultural heritage while remaining constantly open to other civilizations as a source of fruitful interaction and enrichment.We are proud of the positive response by world public opinion to these achievements  as well as the growing support we have had for the democratic process to which Tunisia is committed in this new era.In the same context  we have worked diligently with our brothers in the region to promote the establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union - a regional group designed to meet the historical aspirations of the peoples of our area to solidarity aid complementarity. Vast prospects have thereby been opened for growing co-operation and integration in all fields of activity. That is an example of what South-South co-operation should be.Tunisia has welcomed the growing climate of detente in international relations and has followed with optimism aid satisfaction the efforts to achieve disarmament  as well as the progress made towards the long-hoped-for solutions to most international and regional conflicts. It is our most fervent hope that this process will be maintained and developed further  in view of its vital importance for all mankind aid the powerful stimulus it provides by helping to eliminate tension  paving the way towards the solution of so-far-intractable issues  and channelling efforts towards mankind's development aid well-being  everywhere in the world.It cannot be denied  however  that detente - which we have long sought to restore to international life aid whose early signs have  to our great satisfaction  begun to appear - has not had a positive effect .on the most complex international issues. Consequently  it is incumbent upon the international community and all peace-loving nations to shoulder their responsibilities by exerting greater efforts and taking initiatives to help solve these issues  for the sake of preserving world peace and ensuring that the principles of justice  freedom and international concord prevail and endure among all peoples.Foremost among those chronic conflicts is the Palestine issue and the ordeal of the Palestinian people  who for many decades have been subjected to campaigns of expulsion and oppression  under the yoke of Israeli occupation.We hail the courageous stand of Palestinian leaders in calling for a just and peaceful solution and express our respect and admiration for the Palestinian people's valiant intifadah  which has confirmed to the world over the last two years its iron will and heroic determination to fight on in defence of its rights  dignity and very existence. At the same time  and with equal vehemence we condemn the various forms of violence and repression perpetrated by the Israeli occupation forces  as well as Israel's adamant determination to thwart all chances for peace.We believe that recognition of the Palestinian State by more than 100 Member nations of the General Assembly and other favourable responses from world public opinion are clear signs of the soundness of the clear-sighted and responsible course of action pursued by the Palestinian leadership. This is a good reason for the international community  in this period of growing detente  to redouble its efforts to hasten the convening of the International Peace Conference and thereby pave the way for a just  lasting and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian problem.Tunisia has the honour of acting as host to the headquarters of the fraternal Palestinian leadership and has welcomed all positive developments in the question of Palestine  in particular the United States-Palestinian dialogue that is taking place on its soil. We wish to reiterate our hope that that dialogue will continue until its anticipated results are achieved.The Middle East region is beset with another bloody tragedy: the brotherly people of Lebanon is paying a heavy daily toll in human and material losses amidst a complex political crisis that threatens to doom the country to utter devastation. I wish here to make a solemn appeal to all our brothers who are parties to the conflict to place the higher interests of their country above all other considerations and to marshal all their efforts to save Lebanon.We do not believe that can be done without a resolute call to reason  by responding to the Arab Tripartite Committee's efforts towards peace and reconciliation - totally supported by us - so Lebanon may remain an Arab  united  independent and sovereign country on its own territory.We were greatly relieved when a cease-fire was reached between Iraq and Iran in conformity with Security Council resolution 598 (1987). A long and bloody war that had exhausted the resources of the two neighbour countries was thus brought to an end  thanks in large part to the strenuous efforts exerted in an internationalist spirit by the Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Yet the situation of neither war nor peace now prevailing in the area  with all its potential threats  remains a matter of serious concern to all of us. Hence the urgent need for the international community to support United Nations efforts to ensure the full implementation of all the provisions of the Security Council resolution both in spirit and in letter. Only thus will it be possible to reach a true peace that will put an end to the war and restore security and stability to the Gulf region.Colonialism in all its forms is now a thing of the irrevocable past  thanks to the awakening of peoples and their steady striving for emancipation and liberation. The progress of Namibia  the last Bastion of colonialism in Africa  along the road to independence clearly shows that the national struggle for liberation  with due support and backing from the international community  is the surest way for oppressed peoples to fulfil their legitimate aspiration to live in freedom  security and dignity.On behalf of Tunisia  I wish to reiterate our deepest appreciation of the efforts of the Secretary-General end all the other parties that took part in formulating the United Nations plan contained in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and in working for the full implementation of ail its provisions with as many guarantees as possible. In the case of the fraternal African country of Namibia and its national leadership  the South West Africa People's Organization  such guarantees are all the more imperative in view of the disinformation campaigns and other suspicious manoeuvres that the South African regime is capable of concocting. We reaffirm our active solidarity with the brotherly people of Namibia and our support for its struggle for freedom and independence  and we pay a tribute to the position of the front-line States  inspired by genuine African solidarity  in their support for the Namibian cause  despite the vengeful reprisals against them and the flagrant violations of their territorial integrity.While the hour of deliverance seems near at hand for the people of Namibia  our brothers in South Africa are still exposed to the most hideous forms of racial discrimination and to campaigns of repression aimed at stifling the struggle for equality and for the establishment of a democratic system in which the rule of the majority would prevail. The plight of the people of South Africa remains a source of constant concern to us  and arouses our indignation and shame at this abominable behaviour which tramples under foot the most elementary human values and contravenes international conventions. Tunisia  which has constantly and unfailingly stood by the people of South Africa in its noble struggle  once again vigorously condemns the policy of apartheid and the obstinacy with which the minority regime continues to pursue the same practices despite hollow promises of change.Tunisia continues to follow with keen interest and great appreciation the efforts of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity aid the Secretary-General of the United Nations to implement the United Nations peace plan for Western Sahara  which is of course a matter of concern to us. We firmly believe that these efforts will in the near future bring about the desired settlement  whereby peace and security in our region will be preserved so we can mobilize all our efforts in the service of development in an environment where co-operation  complementarity and harmony prevail.We are greatly satisfied at the success of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan in bringing about the total withdrawal of all foreign forces from that brotherly country. We applauded that withdrawal  and we hope that our Afghan brothers will reach national reconciliation that will stop the bloodshed and put an aid to the suffering of a people which has had more than its share of the scourge of war and destruction.Tunisia likewise followed with interest the work of the Paris Conference on Cambodia  in which all the parties concerned and their allies took part. Even though the Conference did not lead to the positive results that  perhaps a little too optimistically  had been hoped for  we hope that the future of the country will not be negatively affected by these results. We continue to hope that the parties to the conflict and other nations concerned will return to the negotiating table in another attempt to deliver the Cambodian people from its tragedy and enable it to exercise its natural right to freedom and sovereignty on its land  free from all foreign intervention.In Central America  the conclusion of the Esquipulas Agreements is another sign of the general climate of detente and an expression of the desire of the peoples of the area to build a regional environment where peace and co-operation will prevail over tension and confrontation.International concord  as illustrated by the various agreements and meetings on ways to reduce the arms race and eliminate the arsenals of mass extermination  has given rise to justifiable hopes that  at least in the long term  we shall achieve general and complete disarmament  especially in the nuclear field. The recent agreement reached by the two super-Powers on nuclear weapons is certainly a positive move in the direction of detente and is likely to reduce the level of international tension and reallocate the huge sums of money earmarked for the nuclear build-up to the financing of development projects to make the world a better place to live in.While insisting on the need for disarmament as a radical means to avert the dangers to human life resulting from the accumulation of destructive weaponry  we cannot forget another threat to the human race hanging over us  namely  the pollution of the natural environment and the deterioration of life-sustaining elements  with all the disasters this can entail  such as the decay of the ozone layer  which can have dire consequences - indeed some have already begun to appear. We look forward to the 1992 United Nations conference on the environment and development  a most important event that will open up prospects of strengthened international co-operation and the implementation of concerted and equitable joint endeavours aimed at protecting the environment and ensuring a safe future for generations to come. Similarly  attempts at dumping toxic waste and other industrial residue by various arbitrary means are a crime against nature  cause serious damage to the environment  and represent deliberate tampering with man's right to a safe and secure life. narcotic drugs constitute another crime that is taking on extremely grave proportions: they have a negative effect on human beings and society that is so terrifying that it hardly needs to be underlined. The international community as a whole must as a matter of urgency aim at eradicating this scourge through redoubled joint efforts. Obviously  putting an end to the production and use of drugs  andtrading in them  is the first concern  but the deep roots which have given rise to this serious problem in certain societies must also be analysed. These causes appear to be mainly economic and social: poverty  misery  unemployment and ignorance. We have all welcomed the growing spirit of detente and concord in international relations and the positive steps made towards resolving various crises. Yet  for all their worth  such achievements will remain fragile as long asfundamental and structural reforms are not introduced in world relations  which continue to be marked by imbalances and injustices detrimental to the least developed countries.We in Tunisia believe that progress towards desirable solutions of these problems depends essentially on reviving the paralysed North-South dialogue by injecting into it the kind of real political will so necessary to attain positive results that would rekindle the hopes and aspirations of developing peoples and bring about a fairer distribution of the fruits of their endeavours and a better balance in world trade.In point of fact  the deterioration of the terms of trade and the fall in raw-material prices  to say nothing of the volume of debt  excessive servicing charges and the ensuing transfer of wealth to creditor countries  constitute so many heavy burdens encumbering developing countries and crippling their development efforts.As regards international monetary relations  it is worthwhile pointing to the negative trends that have recently emerged as a result of changes introduced in the system of financial aid transfers to developing countries and  in particular  the drying up of capital flows in the direction of medium-income countries - a Phenomenon at once surprising and deplorable when we consider the efforts to ensure those countries' recovery and the bold measures they have taken  imposing enormous sacrifices upon their peoples  in order to emerge from underdevelopment by relying mainly on their own means and resources.It goes without saying that the bold decisions recently taken by a number of industrialized nations to cancel the debts of sons least-developed countries constitute a large and praiseworthy step towards alleviating the third-world debtburden. We can only hope that the advanced countries will also pay heed to the interests and concerns of the developing medium-income countries.By way of contributing to the serious quest for adequate solutions to the debt problem  and aware of the need for a coherent strategy  which would meet with the support of all parties concerned  to handle this thorny issue  President Ben Ali submitted to the industrial summit of the group of seven at Toronto  last year  a set of practical proposals based on workable formulas likely to give an impetus to international co-operation and to stimulate development efforts in our country. In his regard we call upon the international community to consider in depth  through dialogue and concertation  ways and means of setting up an effective plan of action likely to lead to the achievement of those objectives. We consider that here the United Nations has a distinct determining role that it must play. We believe that a special session of the General Assembly - scheduled to be held in the near future - on international co-operation  and particularly on the revitalization of economic growth in the developing countries  will provide a valuable opportunity to start this dialogue and intensify concerted efforts between North and South.		International life in recent years has witnessed various high-level activities meetings. I shall mention in particular the extraordinary Arab summit session Casablanca  the twenty-fifth summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  at Addis Ababa  and the ninth summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  at Belgrade. To us  these events constituted so many useful opportunities to exchange views on the situation now prevailing in the world and to arrive at a set of resolutions and recommendations essentially aimed at consolidating peace and detente and strengthening international co-operation.Today  the eyes of the world are turned  with optimism and hope  to our organization as it assembles for the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. The world is expectant of the conclusions we shall reach and our possible future efforts to achieve detente and strengthen world peace and security by creating conditions propitious to impartial  fruitful co-operation between nations based on mutual solidarity  concord and harmony  for the benefit of the entire human race.Allow me in conclusion  on behalf of Tunisia  to convey to the President and to the Secretary-General our warmest regards and best wishes for the success of this session in attaining the noble goals of the Organization and in fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of our peoples to security  peace and progress."
"139",6994,"TUR",44,1989,"ï»¿At the outset I extend my warm congratulations to the President on his election to preside over the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. This session is being held at a time when encouraging changes are taking place on the world scene. I am confident that under his guidance the session will contribute to the improvement of the international atmosphere by addressing the issues before it with courage  vision and realism.I should also like to pay a tribute to the President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo  who carried out his duties with competence and wisdom.Since it came into being 44 years ago the United Nations has embodied the hopes and aspirations of mankind for a peaceful and prosperous existence on this planet. Unfortunately  the years of the cold war and East-West tensions prevented the world body from properly addressing those universal aspirations.We now appear to be entering a new phase in international relations  one that is characterized by a keener awareness on all sides that to achieve the objectives sought by the founders of the world body co-operation must replace confrontation  mutual confidence must replace historical suspicions and constructive dialogue must replace propaganda and invective. Those are the trends that have becomediscernible on the international scene in recent years  and the resulting greater East-West co-operation has seen a blossoming of activities within the United Nations that are bound to make our world a better and more peaceful environment for all of us. The new international atmosphere has made it possible for the United Nations to tackle more purposefully the still-too-many sources of regional conflict. Important advances  even breakthroughs  have been achieved in that area.The Organization is also tackling the very important economic-development issues of our day with new vigour and much greater realism. We are hopeful that the fourth United Nations development decade will reflect that new spirit and that creative and innovative solutions will be sought to alleviate the debt burden that weighs so heavily on so many Members of the Organization.As the spirit of the new era asserts itself  we expect to see the Organization become more active in the important field of human rights. Human rights is one of those areas where the interests of all mankind converge  and it is natural that that universal concern should be reflected to a much greater extent in our debates.We are confident that that trend will continue and that this session of the General Assembly will be an important milestone in our search for a better and safer world.As the climate of East-West relations continues to improve  the momentum initiated by the United States and the Soviet Union towards the consolidation of that climate is universally welcomed. All countries  notwithstanding their size and policy orientation  have an indisputable stake in the furtherance and expansion of this propitious atmosphere. That is why we must all strive to make our contributions to the transformation of the political  economic  social and ecological environment. In this spirit Turkey will continue to make its contribution towards overcoming the Challenges facing mankind. This is a huge undertaking that can be tackled only in a gradual but progressively expanding manner. Guided by this philosophy  Turkey will continue to pursue actively a policy aimed at creating in its region relations based on mutual confidence that would help foster beneficial co-operation.Times of change are times of opportunities. We are happy to note that these opportunities are being seized.The successful conclusion of the follow-up to the Vienna Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) opened up the way for the negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe. Since the beginning of this new process of negotiations between the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven members of the Warsaw Pact  promising proposals have been put forward to establish a conventional balance at lower levels. This new and realistic approach to arms reduction negotiations  reflecting the constructive spirit that has begun to prevail in East-West relations in recent years  will have a positive effect on the future of multilateral arms control and disarmament efforts in general.The implementation in good faith of the Helsinki Final Act and its concluding documents in all their aspects will decisively contribute to the attainment of an atmosphere of confidence and good will in Europe and thus to the smooth progress of the negotiations under way in Vienna.The Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  to take place in Geneva in August and September 1990  has already held its first and second sessions and completed an important part of its work in conformity with its mandate.As a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  Turkey holds the view that strict adherence to the Treaty is of vital significance. While the Treaty has so far performed its function  the need remains to strengthen further the non-proliferation regime. Similarly  increasing international co-operation in nuclear safety and the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be given firm and universal support.We welcome the proposals made by President George Bush in his statement regarding the elimination of chemical weapons. We welcome also the positive Soviet response contained in Mr  Shevardnadze's statement. We consider this an auspicious step in the arms control process.The convening of the Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in Paris in January 1989 and the unanimous adoption of a Final Declaration encompassing various aspects of this important problem constitute yet another major development. We hope that the Conference on Disarmament will move ahead faster to an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention that would globally ban the development; production  stockpiling  transfer and use of chemical weapons under effective verification. Turkey does not have chemical weapons in stock nor does it aspire to possess any in the future.After the entry into force and the ongoing implementation of the Inter mediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty  it is with great interest that the hopes of the international community are pinned on the successful completion of the strategic arms reduction talks (START). A satisfactory START treaty would contribute significantly to the maintenance of the momentum of the arms control negotiations.Turkey attaches importance to the success of the arms control and disarmament process as a whole  which it views as a comprehensive  integrated endeavourencompassing nuclear as well as conventional aid chemical weapons  and confidence- and security-building measures.We support all realistic initiatives in this field that hold the chance of being translated into concrete  balanced aid verifiable measures without diminishing the security of any country or group of countries.Last year witnessed great achievements in the CSCE process. The crowing of efforts undertaken by the participating countries in producing a balanced document in Vienna constitutes yet another stepping-stone on this long and arduous path. By retaining the indispensable balance between all three baskets  the Vienna document has covered further ground  especially in the field of human rights  since security and confidence presuppose strict adherence to human rights and fundamental freedoms. In fact  without addressing the sanctity of the individual and his basic right to freedom  achieving security in the military sense will fail. We are heartened that today respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms has become a universal concern  a concern that transcends all boundaries. Today no country can evade its responsibilities in the field of human rights by hiding behind the shield of national sovereignty. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms has become the principal attribute of modern statehood.In this connection I feel obliged to bring to this Assembly's attention a most serious issue that threatens to undermine the efforts to create an atmosphere of confidence  peace  stability and co-operation in Europe. It also affects the lives and well-being of 1.5 million people.Bulgaria has been pursuing an inhuman assimilation and repression campaign against its Turkish minority since the end of 1984. Following the brutal and bloody repression oÂ£ the mass hunger strikes and peaceful demonstrations staged by ethnic Turks in May 1989  the Bulgarian authorities have resorted to the deportation of our kinsmen in large numbers. Bulgaria's policies have resulted ina mass exodus to Turkey of more than 300 000 people  fleeing their homeland to escape oppression. This figure alone can give some idea of the intolerable dimensions of this colossal humanitarian problem. We believe that the sheer magnitude of this tragedy transcends the religious  ideological  political and cultural differences among nations. All nations should join in condemning the shameful policies that forced hundreds of thousands of men  women and children to emigrate to Turkey  leaving behind their lands  homes  possessions  social rights and  in some cases  even their sons of military age and other close relatives. We know that decant people everywhere share our indignation. No human being respectful of human rights and upholding the principles enshrined in the very foundations of the United Nations can be oblivious to this enormous human tragedy.We are not seeking to undermine the sovereignty or the well being of Bulgaria. We do seek  however  a peaceful aid just solution to end the sufferings of our kinsmen whose rights and existence are safeguarded by various bilateral agreements and multilateral documents. We insist that Bulgaria honour its international obligations  including its commitments under the CSCE. In this regard  we have oily two objectives - aid they are peaceful aid humanitarian. First and foremost  we demand that the usurped human and minority rights of Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin be restored aid respected. Secondly  we wish to negotiate with Bulgaria with a view to concluding a comprehensive agreement on emigration to safeguard the rights aid family unity of those ethnic Turks who have already arrived in Turkey and to enable all those who my wish to emigrate to our country in the future to do so in an orderly manner aid without having to relinquish their social and property rights in Bulgaria.To avoid any misunderstanding  let me stress here that our preference  of course  is not to see any more of our kinsmen uprooted from their homes. We would rather have them living in Bulgaria as loyal citizens of their country aid enjoying fully their human and minority rights. Let me reiterate  however  that Turkey is ready to receive  within the framework of a comprehensive emigration agreement  all the ethnic Turks in Bulgaria who may wish to leave that country.Most regrettably  our repeated appeals to the Government of Bulgaria to enter into serious dialogue to bring about a satisfactory solution to this humanitarian problem have so far yielded no results owing to Bulgaria's intransigent attitude and its refusal to acknowledge the very existence of the problem. That is a clear indication that Bulgaria's real purpose is not to facilitate the emigration of ethnic Turks to -Turkey but to eliminate the problem by evicting these people from the country  to allow emigration only under its own specific terms aid to assimilate the remaining Turks in due course.Turkey has therefore decided to revert to the existing visa regime between the two countries by putting an end to the exceptional practice  in use since the beginning of June 1989  of allowing Bulgarian citizens to enter Turkey without a visa. This unfortunate minority question is not simply a bilateral problem between Turkey and Bulgaria  but is an issue of principle between Bulgaria and the entire community of nations. That is why a large number of countries have voiced their objections to Bulgaria's unacceptable policies and urged it to heed reason. That is why international bodies  including the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Council of Europe and the European Parliament  have adopted unambiguous resolutions to the same effect. That is why the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Organization of the Islamic Conference will hold an extraordinary meeting here in New York tomorrow on the tragedy of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria.I should like to use this occasion to call upon my colleagues assent led here today to redouble their efforts to persuade Bulgaria to alter its anachronistic Practices. The Government of Bulgaria must be assisted - and effectively - to realize that to abandon those policies would not be a sign of weakness but a virtue. And Bulgaria knows full well that should it display the courage and wisdom not to persist in its untenable stand  Turkey  mindful of the once mutually beneficial relations of good-neighbourliness and cooperation between the two countries  will not hesitate to take reciprocal steps conducive to the normalization of Turkish-Bulgarian relations. I listened attentively to the statement made this morning by the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria. Mr. Mladenov referred  as we do  to dialogue as the best means for the mutually desired normalization of Turkish-Bulgarian relations. He neglected  however  to acknowledge that the tragedy imposed on ethnic -Barks in Bulgaria was and remains the only reason for the present tension. He also forgot to note that the implementation of the Belgrade Protocol to which he referred was inconclusive owing to the refusal of the Bulgarian side to discuss this humanitarian issue. Therefore  I must say - and with regret - that his statement today contained no new elements  despite the optimistic note he attempted to strike. But  of course  if through that statement the Bulgarian side implies that it is ready and willing to enter into a dialogue with us with a view to putting an end to the plight of the Turkish Muslim minority in Bulgaria in all its aspects  we would  as I stressed earlier  not hesitate to reciprocate. But  clearly  we cannot build castles of hope on vague positions; we cannot invest hope in calls for dialogue in a vacuum. Turkey  therefore  will wait for Bulgaria to demonstrate through concrete and significant steps its will aid commitment to contribute to the solution of the problem it has created. We shall wait for the Bulgarian Government to declare unambiguously its readiness also to discuss this particular issue in the negotiations the entire community of nations has been calling for. Otherwise  the positive mood the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria tried to create in this Hall will wither away before long.By virtue of Turkey's geographical location and its historical ties  the Middle East and the fate of the people of that region are of particular interest for us. We have been following with concern the increasing tensions in the area. Turkey has on several occasions expressed  from this rostrum  its firm stand on the question of Palestine  which constitutes the crux of the Middle East conflict.After more than two decades of occupation  the West Bank and Gaza have erupted into open rebellion. The frustration of the Palestinians is not a matter that can be dealt with by the use of force. The death toll aid the level of violence are bound to increase so long as the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians are suppressed. Since December 1987 events have demonstrated that the Palestinians will not be intimidated by violence and that the intifadah will not peter out. We are appealing once again for the end of harsh repressive measures.The Palestine Liberation Organization has taken important steps to break the present deadlock by adopting policies which have been recognized as realistic and constructive. Israel should reciprocate those moves by adopting more conciliatory policies. Israel should also consider with self-confidence and vision the ideas that have been put forward in the hope of contributing to the initiation of a promising phase in the peace process.Turkey is convinced that there can be no satisfactory long-term solution to this serious problem that is not based on negotiations with the participation of all the interested parties  conducted in good faith within the framework of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East.Another source of concern for my Government is the tragic situation in Lebanon. We welcome the sustained efforts of Saudi Arabia  Algeria aid Morocco aimed at achieving national reconciliation in that country  Turkey believes that in bringing the state of anarchy in that coin try to an aid a framework mist be found that will ensure Lebanon's unity  independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  aid the removal of all foreign troops.A subject that arouses anxiety in Turkey is the tragedy of the hostages in Lebanon. The early release and safe return home of all hostages is the common wish of the international community.We welcome all peace initiatives relating to the Iran-Iraq conflict. Special tribute should be paid to the dedicated efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Representative on the complicated issues relating to the implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We hope that these mediation efforts will create the necessary atmosphere of mutual trust favourable to the full and rapid implementation of that resolution. The present situation is unsatisfactory aid precarious  and it should not be allowed to continue.As a country that maintains friendly relations with both parties  we reaffirm our readiness to contribute in any way we can to the progress of the peace process and the promotion of a climate of confidence.The tragic situation in Afghanistan continues to be a source of particular concern aid distress for Turkey. The conclusion of the Geneva Agreements constituted an important step towards the political solution of the Afghanistan problem. Through those Agreements we have seen the withdrawal of foreign troops. Now  the need for a broad-based Government  fully representative of the Afghan people  stands out as an essential element for a lasting solution of this problem. At present  Pakistan continues to bear the brunt of the burden of providing shelter for the Afghan refugees who have been driven by war from their homes. Pakistan's generosity has rightly earned it the gratitude of the international community.The signing  in New York last December  of the agreements among Angola  Cuba aid South Africa aimed at achieving peace in southern Africa aid the independence of Namibia within the framework of Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has beena source of deep satisfaction for Turkey. We are looking forward to the day when we welcome Namibia in our midst as an independent  democratic State. As one of the founding members of the United Nations Council for Namibia  Turkey is profoundly satisfied by these developments. It is imperative  however  that the remaining obstacles to the effective and full implementation or the United Nations plan for Namibia be completely removed.In neighbouring South Africa  the apartheid system is a blatant violation of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In spite of the many resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council condemning that abominable system. South Africa has chosen stubbornly to ignore the universal revulsion  and has so far refused to make a radical change in its racial policies. The complete elimination of apartheid is the only acceptable solution  and will continue to be our common goal.The positive developments concerning the situation in Cambodia in the last few months give us hope that an end to the suffering of that beleaguered nation might be in the offing. Turkey appreciates the diplomatic activities  especially those of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  aimed at achieving this objective  and pays tribute to the efforts of the States that participated in the international conference on Cambodia.In eastern Asia  the division of the Korean peninsula continues to be a source of unease for the international community. We attach importance to and support the initiatives undertaken by the Republic of Korea aimed at a meaningful dialogue with its neighbour. The peaceful solution of the questions between the two sides through dialogue based on mutual accommodation will  I am confident  lead to their eventual representation as full Members of our Organization.International co-operation against drugs is a must. The new Convention against illicit trafficking is a major step in the right direction. It will make new demands on the United Nations bodies involved  which are already spread thin. The allocation in the regular budget of greater resources to the International narcotics Control Board secretariat and to the Division of narcotic Drugs is indispensable  for more effective use of United Nations expertise on drugs  contributions to the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control should be increased. Multilateral co-operation against illicit trafficking can offer the best challenge against the scourge. My country is a good example of the results that can be achieved in this area.International terrorism continues to be a global problem and a major source of tension in international relations. Turkey has always condemned as criminal all acts  methods and practices of terrorism  regardless of their origins  causes or purposes. We believe that terrorism cannot be justified under any circumstances. In this context I would observe that attempts to differentiate between various forms of terrorism will only encourage the terrorists. Experience has amply demonstrated that tolerance and support of terrorism is a double-edged sword  and that those who have followed that path have always had reasons to regret their short-sighted policy.Last year the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sides embarked upon a new negotiating process. We welcomed that development. We had hoped that this latest set of negotiations would pave the way to a lasting settlement in Cyprus and lead to the establishment of a bi-communal  bi-zonal federation based on the political equality of the two peoples on the island.It will be recalled that  prior to this latest phase in the talks  the Greek Cypriots had rejected the framework agreement of 29 March 1986 Which the Turkish Cypriote had accepted  m doing so  the Greek Cypriots added yet another notch to their long list of missed and wasted opportunities for conciliation in the island. This new round of negotiations represents  in a sense  a last chance for an honourable settlement  because Turkish Cypriot patience is beginning to reach its limits in the face of constant Greek Cypriot intransigence. Looking back  it is difficult to say that the Greek Cypriots even came close to making wise use of this latest opportunity. They failed to negotiate constructively  and from the outset they preferred the intervention of third parties so as to have them exert pressure on the Turkish Cypriots. Once the Greek Cypriots opted for such a fundamentally erroneous and counterproductive approach  they felt no need to respond  even halfway  to comprehensive Turkish Cypriot proposals that had been presented formally and in writing in the course of the negotiations.The Greek Cypriot side has in the mean time engaged in new acts of violence in Cyprus and has committed transgressions against Turkish Cypriot territory. It has also pursued a programme of intensive rearmament. Purchases of weapons and military equipment that are under way have reached alarming proportions. All of these Greek Cypriot actions spoil the atmosphere and deepen the mistrust in the island.The Turkish Cypriot people have been compelled to react to this situation through a resolution adopted in their parliament. Despite all the provocations  the resolution kept the door open to direct negotiations without any preconditions. It is yet to be seen whether the Greek Cypriots will return to the path of fair and honest talks. It is also yet to be seen whether they can take a step forward by pledging respect for the existence of the Turkish Cypriots as one of the two distinct and politically equal peoples of the island. We attach paramount importance to this point  because only then  without the burden of hostile practices  will the negotiating process have a reasonable chance of success.Last week  the Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece made extensive comments on Cyprus in his statement to the General Assembly. I regret to say that the mentality and the attitude displayed in that statement cast a dark shadow over the efforts for a negotiated settlement in Cyprus. We have seen in his statement a very unfortunate approach designed to misrepresent the facts on Cyprus with a view to misleading the international community.There is much to be said concerning the grave responsibility of Greece with regard to the emergence and the perpetuation of the Cyprus question. It is Greece and the Greek Cypriots who were fully responsible for the destruction of the bi-communal partnership republic in Cyprus in 1963 through the use of force. Greece and the Greek Cypriots have been responsible for keeping Cyprus in a constant state of crisis for 11 years and for keeping the Turkish Cypriots virtual hostages in their own lad prior to 1974. Greece and Greek Cypriots are responsible for the coup of 15 July 1974 in which they tried to deal a final blow to the independence of the island and to the Turkish Cypriots' existence there. Turkey can take credit for bringing this unacceptable state of affairs to an end and for providing security for the Turkish Cypriots.I would have preferred not to be placed in the position of having to recall the dark role played by Greece at critical stages in the recent history of Cyprus. I am deeply disturbed to see that Greece is once again on a similarly harmful course at another critical juncture in Cyprus. With the utmost regret aid reluctance  I feel compelled to bring this situation to the attention of the Assembly on this occasion. We have also brought this to the attention of the Secretary-General.Today the world economic prospects for growth and trade call for more optimism than before. A rapid rate of growth in the industrialized countries has been associated with the expansion of employment  the relative reduction of external imbalances  the meaningful progress in some structural reforms  aid the acceleration of both export and import volumes.As far as developing countries are concerned  the economic environment has also improved considerably in some of them as a result of policy reforms and world trade expansion. However  many of those countries have not derived their fair share from revived economic growth and they continue to face major problems  including high inflation rates  heavy debt burdens  structural adjustment challenges and population pressures. A number of challenges are also faced by industrialized countries on the path of continuing stable expansion.All those problems  risks and uncertainties call for improved international co-operation in an increasingly interdependent world. Only thus  we believe  can the challenges we face together be met successfully for the benefit of humankind as a whole. In concluding  I wish to renew our hope that this forty-fourth session of the General Assembly will be fruitful and will contribute to the security and well-being of all nations."
"140",7056,"TZA",44,1989,"ï»¿My delegation congratulates you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. You bring to this office a wealth of experience and diplomatic skill which assures us of your ability to guide the proceedings of this session to a successful conclusion. Your election is also a fitting tribute to your great country  Nigeria  with which Tanzania enjoys excellent relations  aid to the role Nigeria plays in the furtherance of African aspirations in pursuance of international peace and security  understanding and cooperation. My delegation is therefore happy to see you preside over the Assembly and it is with pleasure that I Pledge my delegate's cooperation in the discharge of the responsibilities which the Assembly has placed on you.Your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  presided over the deliberations of the Assembly at its forty-third session with exemplary skill  dedication and steadfastness. I wish to record my appreciation of his work and to extend to him my best wishes in his future undertakings.The Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has continued to serve this noble Organization with untiring efforts and unswerving dedication. I wish to pay a special tribute to him. His duties are both daunting and challenging  but over the years we have come to expect of him both perseverance and wisdom as he undertakes difficult missions and pursues delicate negotiations. Tanzania renews its oft-stated support for the Secretary-General and for the United Nations. This Organization remains the hope of mankind and its survival. Its universality provides us with a forum in which we fashion a common purpose  chart a common path aid co-operate for the benefit of our common interests.Last month saw the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War  the devastating effects of which are unparalleled in the history of mankind  Today our world is still suffering from the effects of that war. For this reason the search for world peace continues to be pressing. It must transcend national borders  race  colour and ideology. But peace and oppression are mutually exclusive for there cannot be peace where there is oppression. Everywhere - in Europe  the Americas  the Middle East  Asia and Africa - oppression of whatever kind must be condemned and it must be ended.The worst manifestation of oppression in the world today is the system of apartheid practised by the Pretoria regime. Just as Nazism  50 years ago  denied the humanity of its victims because of their race  so today apartheid  that evil system of institutionalised racism  denies the humanity of the majority of the people of South Africa because of the colour of their skin. In recent years. apartheid has taken on a new dimension  manifested in acts of aggression aid destabilization of South Africa's neighbours. Each time the international community brought pressure to bear on South Africa because of its apartheid policies  the regime has come out with diversionary tactics aimed at misleading the international community into believing that meaningful changes were being undertaken. At present South Africa has put forward a so-called programme to end apartheid. In fact  no fundamental and genuine reforms are envisaged. The international community must recognize that these are the same old tricks that the regime has used in the past to ward off international pressure.We must not be deceived. The change in the State President in South Africa does not represent a change in policy. As one leader of the oppressed black people of South Africa has warned  what has happened is that what the racists have done is to get a more competent navigator for the ship of apartheid; but that ship maintains its direction.The world does not have to look far to prove this. As late as last Friday  the South African Government hanged an activist of the African National Congress  Geoffrey Busman Magenta  in blatant defiance of appeals for clemency from a body of no less stature than this Assembly. What further evidence do we need to prove that apartheid is not about to be reformed  rather that it is on the march? The international community must intensify its pressure on the Pretoria regime with a view to abolishing apartheid.Africa has stated its position with regard to the opening of negotiations for a peaceful solution of the South African crisis through the Harare Declaration. The pre-conditions that would be an earnest of serious intent by the apartheid regime include the lifting of the state of emergency; the release of political prisoners  particularly Nelson Mandela; a halt to political executions and detentions; the withdrawal of the army from the townships; the removal of the ban on political parties; and the return of all political exiles without hindrance.The new Government in South Africa has not stated unambiguously to the world that it will abolish apartheid and work towards the creation of a united  democratic  non-racial South Africa. Neither is it ready for a meaningful dialogue with the true representatives of the oppressed people of South Africa. Until those conditions are fulfilled  pressure on the apartheid regime mist be stepped up  not relaxed. Tanzania shall continue to press for the imposition on the Pretoria regime of comprehensive  mandatory sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.Elsewhere in southern Africa  the Pretoria regime continues to offer material and political support to dissident and bandit groups fighting lawful Governments. In Angola the support given to UNITA by South Africa and the United States Administration is completely unjustified and reprehensible; it makes it impossible to attain a quick and honourable internal reconciliation in Angola. In Mozambique  the Pretoria regime has not ceased its support to the RSNAMO bandits  who continue to commit massacres and destroy infrastructure and property. Tanzania calls upon the international community to condemn these acts of destabilization by the Pretoria regime which have led to the loss of thousands of lives and billions of dollars in property in the front-line States and other neighbouring countries. The international community cannot afford to remain indifferent to these heinous crimes committed by the Pretoria regime. For apartheid is a crime against humanity and the war against it should be global and universal.Six months have passed since the commencement of the implementation of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978). On 7 November 1989 the people of Namibia will be taking part  for the first time  in what are hoped will be democratic elections under United Nations supervision. We are seriously concerned over the implementation of the plan in view of South Africa's continued flagrant violation of the provisions of the plat. We are perturbed by the electoral procedures adopted by the South African Administrator-General which allowed the registration  as voters  of South Africans and other non-Namibians. We are further concerned over the proposed electoral law  which lacks the provision for secrecy in the ballot box. We call on the Secretary-General to ensure that the forthcoming elections in Namibia are indeed free and fair  so as to produce a government that truly represents the wishes of the majority of the Namibian people.In other conflicts on the African continent  efforts to bring about peace continue. Tanzania supports the role played by the United Nations in conjunction with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in the search for a resolution of the Western Sahara problem. The meeting in Marrakech between His Majesty King Hassan II and a delegation from the POL IS ARID Front was a positive step towards the establishment of a dialogue between the parties. We regret very much that projected further meetings have not taken place and we express the hope that the dialogue will expeditiously resume. Meanwhile  we support the efforts of the Secretary-General in trying to arrange for the holding of a referendum so as to ensure that the Sahraoui people enjoy self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV).The continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories  including parts of southern Lebanon  is unacceptable. This occupation is in defiance of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. The massacres  brutal arrests  detentions  deportations and kidnappings perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people should be condemned by the international community.History has shown that there can never be oppression without resistance. The tenacious and heroic struggle of the Palestinians - the intifadah - has demonstrated the unparalleled will of an oppressed people to fight for their freedom. We applaud the Palestinian people for their resolve while deploring Israeli Government intransigence in ignoring international public opinion. We call upon the Security Council to convene without delay the International Conference on the Middle East  under the auspices of the United Nations  in order to (hart out a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East crisis. The permanent members of the Security Council should participate fully in the Conference  which must of necessity involve all the parties concerned  including the State of Palestine. We call on Israel to give peace a chance by agreeing to participate in the Conference.The situation in the Gulf is less tense now than a few years back but Security Council resolution 598 (1987) has not been fully implemented. We urge the parties concerned to co-operate with the Secretary-General so that the cease-fire can be strengthened as the foundation for a lasting peace. Meanwhile  we should continue to support the United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group as it discharges its very heavy responsibilities.The question of Cyprus has remained on the agenda of the Assembly for many years. It is now 15 years since part of the Republic of Cyprus was occupied by an external Power  resulting in the separation of families  the exodus of refugees and the wanton destruction of property. Tanzania supports the Secretary-General in his endeavours to promote a just solution to the problem of Cyprus. We call upon the Turkish and Greek communities to show restraint. We reiterate our solidarity with the people and Government of Cyprus in their efforts to preserve the independence  sovereignty and unity of their Republic.Although foreign troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan  peace has not been restored to that country. The Geneva Agreements  meant to usher in peace  have not been respected by some of the parties concerned and external interference has hindered genuine national reconciliation and reconstruction. The people of Afghanistan yearn for peace  and we call upon all the parties to the Geneva Agreements to facilitate an early aid comprehensive political settlement in Afghanistan.Tension still lingers on in the Korean peninsula. The will and determination of the Korean people for reunification under a formula agreed upon by both the North and the South should be respected and not interfered with. The withdrawal of foreign troops from the area will pave the way for a peaceful transition to the reunification of Korea.We welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and hail the Jakarta Informal Meetings  which have contributed significantly to the search for a comprehensive solution to the problem. The Paris Conference  which was held in August  was a commendable step towards the achievement of national reconciliation and unity. We urge the different factions to the conflict  with the assistance of the Association of South-East Asian Nations  to continue in their search for a peaceful settlement in Cambodia and the establishment of peace  freedom and neutrality in the countries of the region.The situation in Central America  if not checked  could adversely affect the relaxation of tension in the international political arena. Foreign interference and foreign military intervention  support for subversion and the application of economic blockades have plunged the region into turmoil and undermined the sustained diplomatic efforts by the countries in the region to solve their own problems through dialogue. Tanzania supports the peace agreements concluded by Central American countries and reiterates that peace  development and democracy in Central America should be based on respect for the independence and self-determination of countries and peoples and non-interference in the internal affairs of States. In particular  we urge the cessation of all hostile acts against Nicaragua.We have witnessed a relaxation in world tension as a result of the rapprochement between the super-Powers  as highlighted by the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - the INF Treaty - in December 1987. We commend the super-Powers for their courage and for their realization that world peace was not served by continued  implacable  confrontational hostility towards each other. Yet this rapprochement  vital aid welcome as it is  has not advanced sufficiently the prospect of a stable world peace. The arsenals of both conventional and nuclear weapons remain at alarming levels and we are confronted with more refined and deadly weapons. Tanzania wishes to see a definite movement in the process of nuclear disarmament negotiations. The necessity of adopting measures for achieving nuclear disarmament  with the ultimate goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons  cannot be overemphasized. We therefore call for an immediate ban on nuclear testing. Although bilateral negotiations by the super-Powers are vital  Tanzania believes that the United Nations should play a central role in the field of disarmament. All men everywhere yearn for peace and their fate cannot be left exclusively in the hands of a few countries  even though they are the most powerful.Of late the international community has accorded the issues of the environment their rightful significance. For many years man has abused his environment through the depletion of the ozone layer  deforestation and the dumping of toxic and other hazardous wastes which now threaten the very survival of mankind. It is encouraging to see that the world is awakening and joining hand3 in unison in the search for a solution to this common threat to our common interest of survival. My country supports  and will positively contribute to  international efforts and co-operation in preserving our environment.For universal peace and security to be realized there has to be corresponding economic aid social development. In the early 1970s the developing countries alerted the world community to the monumental deficiencies of the existing global  economic aid financial system  which does not benefit the economies of the developing countries. The dangers and seriousness of the situation were manifested by the breakdown of the Bretton Woods Agreement on the monetary aid financial system and the ever-widening gap in economic growth and development between the developed and the developing countries. The latter then called upon the international community for a change in the world economic arrangement. This body was quick to respond to that call and since then the General Assembly has persistently adopted resolutions calling for the establishment of a new international economic order. Regrettably  these resolutions have not been taken up for implementation.The need to establish a new economic system of this kind is more urgent today than it was 20 years ago. For the developing countries  the 1970s and the 1980s are lost decades for development. However  the world economy is changing: today  no single country can claim economic dominance over others. Therefore  a fair and just international economic system is for the mutual benefit of the developed and the developing countries. It is only through such an economic system that today's pressing global economic problems can be adequately redressed.The economic problems that have plagued the developing countries during the last decade need special attention. Some were caused by natural disasters such as floods and drought  which in turn caused hunger and famine. Others were man-made  such as the debt crisis  and have caused severe economic strains on the developing countries. The resultant lopsided international economic relationship between the developed and the developing countries has thus caused international monetary instability and unpredictable world markets for the commodities of the developing countries. With this world economic trend of the 1980s there was a net transfer of resources from the developing countries through debt servicing and high interest rates. There has also been an enormous reduction of financial flows from the developed countries to the developing countries  so that few developed countries have been able to reach the 0.7 per cent of gross national product target for official development assistance. Moreover  the 1980s have seen a further deterioration in terms of trade  and falling prices for the primary commodities of the developing countries in world markets.In addressing these problems  developing countries have initiated several measures. For its part  Africa  under the auspices of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)  established the Lagos Plan of Action for the development of the continent from 1980 to 2000. In addition  it responded to its severe economic situation by adopting the African Priority Programme for Economic Recovery. This was later incorporated in the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. These efforts have not succeeded in alleviating the economic problems of Africa for the simple reason that the current economic system does not create a conducive economic climate for the reconstruction of environmentally sound and sustainable economies for the developing countries. This situation if further exacerbated by the tardiness displayed by the developed countries with regard to support for the United Nations Programme of Action. My delegation hopes that the plan end aspirations set forth in that Programme  which is scheduled to end next year  will be carried forward until all of its objectives are achieved  including the finding of a permanent solution to the external debt crisis. Also  we make a vigorous appeal to the international community to support the holding of an international conference on Africa indebtedness.My delegation is deeply concerned with the explosive nature of the external debt crisis. However  my country wishes to pay a tribute to all those countries which have taken up positive relief measures such as cancelling some or all of the debts owed them by certain third world countries as a response to the existing realities. These short-term solutions  welcome as they are  must be followed by long-term radical changes in the system  which will lead to a new economic system  a system which will ensure fair and predictable prices in the world market for primary commodities from the developing countries  fair terms of trade aid adequate resource flows to these countries. My delegation thus welcomes the entry into force this year of the Common Fund for Commodities under the auspices of the United Nations and hopes the Rind will boost the efforts of the primary commodity producers and exporters. We call upon all Member States to give strong support to the Fund to enable it to discharge its functions with great efficiency and effectiveness.We have foliated closely current negotiations on trade and development in the ongoing Uruguay Round  which is approaching its end. We are greatly concerned that these negotiations should not ignore the trading needs of the developing countries  in particular the elimination of the overt and covert protectionism practised by some of the developed countries against products from the third world countries. The outcome of the Uruguay Round should not lock developing countries into a new  more unjust world trading system. Further concerted efforts are needed to solve the world's inherent economic problems. The positive economic trends in the developed countries cannot be sustained for long if the economies of the developing countries continue to experience negative trends  nor is it fair for the economies of the developed countries to continue enjoying healthy growth at the expense of the poor economies of the third world countries.In the same spirit  my delegation welcomes the holding in April 1990 of the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international co-operation  particularly in respect of the revitalization of economic growth and development in the developing countries  and calls upon Member States to adopt  by consensus  the proposed new international development strategy for the 1990s  which should address the current global economic problems.The thawing of relations between the great Powers must be deployed positively to assist  among other things  the social  economic and political development of third world countries. This is an auspicious and historic period  for  if the big nations of the world so wish  the world can be a better and more prosperous place to live in  not just for a few nations  but for all of us. We are now confronted with a host of new-generation problems  including the threat to the environment  international terrorism and the menace of drugs. Countries of the world have all risen up against the curse of drugs and drug abuse. This realization of a common threat to mankind and future generations is a positive one  and my country readily pins hands with all those nations resolved to put an end to this terrible phenomenon.The threat to life and Property posed by the incidence of individual and State-sponsored terrorism remains. My country condemns every form of terrorism  whether State-sanctioned or otherwise. The maintenance of a stable international political order demands respect for the rule of international law. Once universally accepted  observance of international law cannot depend on whim  for it is one of the corner-stones of international security and a fundamental safeguard against interference by Member States in each other's internal affairs.We should continue aiding international organizations and agencies which give assistance to refugees and victims of natural disasters. My country and the entire African continent knows the agony that these people go through  z ask that this Organization should continue to give prominence to the work of the High Commissioner for Refugees so that those without hope can find hope again  so that the homeless can build homes again  and so that the needy can be assured of a helping hand. In conclusion  let me underline my country's satisfaction at the thawing of relations between the two super-Powers aid the consequent reduction in tension among nations. My hope is that this positive climate will produce more than handshakes aid self-congratulatory speeches. We must ensure that we reach a just and equitable economic order which will be conducive to rapid and sustained economic growth in third world countries  for without economic development there is little hope for sustained international peace and security. To secure international peace and security is the overriding purpose of the United Nations. I renew Tanzania's consent to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations and its agencies aid Tanzania's support for their work  work upon which rests the promise of a stable future for the community of nations. "
"141",7099,"UGA",44,1989,"ï»¿ Allow me Sir  on behalf of the Ugandan delegation  to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. As Foreign Minister of your country  and as Chairman of the Special Committee against Apartheid  you have demonstrated your commitment to the liberation struggle in Africa and to the struggle against racism  of which apartheid is the worst manifestation. Given your diplomatic skills and your long association with the United Nations  I am confident that you will steer our deliberations successfully.To your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  we owe a debt of gratitude for a job well done. He presided over the forty-third session with consummate skill  remarkable wisdom and tireless devotion. So the Secretary-General together with his dedicated soldiers of peace in the Secretariat  we express profound appreciation for steadfastly continuing to meet the challenges facing the Organization in the pursuit of his mandate - to promote international peace and harmony and to uphold the principles of the Charter. The success of the Secretary-GeneraÄ¾s efforts in this respect is best reflected in his own report Today  at diverse points of the globe  representatives of the United Nations and its Secretary-General are engaged in the arduous tasks of peace and my own visits to different areas of conflict have vividly impressed on roe the great degree of trust and responsibility placed in the Organization   (A/44/1  p  3) The fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War is an opportune time to remind ourselves that the United Nations is a unique edifice of peace and justice. Born out of the ashes and ruins of that war  its Charter accordingly alms at saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The 44 years of the existence of the Organization  compared to the history of a number of countries  may seem a short time. It is a period that has ushered in changes of great magnitude in science and technology - changes that have greatly affected the lifestyles of various peoples and nations. It also ushered in the nuclear age and the escalation of the development of armaments  the danger of which was heightened by a cold war. In the last decade there was a marked retreat from multilateralism and a pervasive fear that the United Nations might suffer the same fate as that of its predecessor - the League of Nations. Currently however  there is a renewal of faith in the United Nations.Uganda welcomes this renewal of faith in the United Nations. This should strengthen the capacity of the Organization to meet the challenges of the next decade and beyond. New patterns of international relationship are emerging pregnant with new opportunities but also with new challenges. There is a better disposition towards the resolution of conflict through peaceful means and a better appreciation of the global problems which transcend the boundaries of individual States and affect us all.As the world has become more interdependent  it should be appreciated that there is an inescapable link between world peace  disarmament  economic and social development  environment and the full enjoyment of human rights as understood in the wider context. The challenge confronting the international community is the management of this interdependence so as to find co-operative solutions in the interests of us all. Peace and security must be viewed in a comprehensive perspective encompassing a wider substantive content and geographical scope.No doubt the dramatic improvement of relations between the two super-Powers and their willingness to work in concert has had a positive impact on a number of regional problems. There is now renewed hope that the long-delayed independence of Namibia may finally be neat. We  however  still harbour a great deal of scepticism about South Africa's intentions and plans for Namibia  especially with respect to the forthcoming electoral exercise and the future Namibian constitution. To ensure that the necessary conditions exist for free and fair elections in Namibia  there must be security for all and a just electoral law.The danger posed by the Koevoets  recognized by the adoption of the United Nations settlement plan  must be removed. The United Nations plan requited that the unit be disarmed and disbanded and its command-structure dismantled. As the Secretary-General correctly observed in his statement to the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (ÐAU) in July 1989  the Koevoets in the South west Africa Police (SWAPOÅ) harass and intimidate the civilian population. The recent assassination of the legal adviser of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) is a grim reminder that these elements  together with other South African agents  clearly pose a serious security threat to SWAPO leadership and their supporters. We have noted the reports that some of these elements have been disarmed and disbanded. It is however imperative that all - and not only some - of these elements be disarmed and disbanded and their command structure totally dismantled. We must guard against the possibility of this dangerous unit being reassembled either before  during or after the elections with a view to frustrating the independence of Namibia. In order to create appropriate conditions  it is essential to have the police arm of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group strengthened. In this connection we welcome the offer by Canada and others to make a contribution to this end  and we urge that the offer be accepted.With respect to the electoral process we are concerned about a number of things. We take strong exception to the Administrator-General usurping the role of supervising and controlling the electoral process as he is not impartial in this exercise. There are real suspicions that his role is designed to pre-empt the outcome of the elections and to make the independence of Namibia a mere sham. Loopholes that would allow rigging at any stage of the electoral process must be removed  the voter-registration law  non-Namibians  especially South Africans and other foreigners  must not  as has been reported  be allowed and enabled to register to vote  and legitimate Namibians must not be disenfranchised. The modalities for the transportation of ballot boxes and the counting of votes must not be subject to manipulation and abuse. Under the constituent Assembly Proclamation  the Administrator-General has given himself veto powers with regard to the requests and recommendations of the constituent Assembly. This state of affairs is totally unacceptable.We appreciate the Secretary-General's efforts to remove these impediments. Both resolution 435 (1978) and resolution 640 (1989) of the Security Cornell place the responsibility for supervising and controlling the electoral process in the hands of the Secretary-General. It is therefore imperative for the General Assembly to send a clear message to South Africa that the Organization and the international community will not countenance any manoeuvres aimed at defrauding the electoral process or reducing the role of the Secretary-General to that of an observer or of merely being reactive.In South Africa Itself the situation remains one of continued grave concern. For three years South Africa has been In a state of emergency under which the most draconian laws are invoked to silence those protesting and struggling against the oppressive regime. The notorious notion of  common purpose  has frequently been used In court decisions to convicting South African patriots and to sentence there to death on long-term Imprisonments.Apartheid cannot be reformed) It must be dismantled. It Is self-delusion to believe that this objective can be attained through an evolutionary process. Mr. de Klerk  the new leader of South Africa  has been giving confusing signals about the changes he plans to introduce regarding apartheid. The experience we have had in the past gives us cause to be sceptical. Both Vorster and Botha at one time or another held themselves out as reformers in South Africa and as peacemakers in the region. The kind of reforms they had in mind were cosmetic changes intended to disguise apartheid  These included the introduction of the infamous Bantustan states and the discredited tricameral constitution  which was designed to co-opt a small section of the oppressed majority into the system while leaving the apartheid system more entrenched. We have yet to see concrete steps being taken by Mr. de Klerk that can give us confidence that he has embarked on the path to the dismantling of apartheid. The state of emergency still continues. African leaders are incarcerated  and legitimate African liberation movements are still banned. Judicial murders are being carried out. Indeed  one of the first actions of Mr. de Klerk as the new State President was to authorize the execution of Mangena Jeffrey Boesman  a South African patriot  despite the appeal from this Assembly. Mr. de Klerk has still a long way to go before he can be accepted as an apostle of change in South Africa. He cannot escape the fundamental questions of equal basic political rights for all regardless of colour and race  of democratic rule  and of the central role of genuine African leaders. These are the questions Mr. de Klerk should address.It ought to be appreciated that the leaders of South African liberation movements are not men of violence any more than the Allies were during the Second World War. The liberation movements took up armed struggle because all peaceful avenues for change were closed. The liberation movements  with the support of Africa  have always been willing to negotiate a transition from apartheid to democracy. This is clearly spelt out in the Lusaka Manifesto of 1969 and the recent Harare Declaration of the OALJ Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa. The  events in Angola  Mozambique  Zimbabwe and now Namibia have proved that Africa is able to meet both the challenges of armed struggle and those of negotiations. The efforts of the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group to establish a basis for negotiations w-e scuttled by Pretoria. It is  therefore  Pretoria which must commit itself to negotiations rather than the other way round.Economic sanctions  internal unrest and the causalities suffered as Ñ result of war  coupled with international isolation  are undermining the Afrikaners' sense of solidarity and support for white racist power. More and more Afrikaners are becoming part of a consensus against apartheid. The liberation movements have responded positively and have given them the necessary reassurances. This is not the time to retreat from sanctions when they are beginning to bear fruit  to regards apartheid  there is no room for equivocation and equally no room for a fence  because there is no fence to sit on. Apartheid must be isolated. Uganda has never been persuaded by self-serving arguments that sanctions should not be imposed because they would harm the black majority. Legitimate spokesmen for the masses in South Africa support such measures. Thus we call for their imposition under Chapter VII of the Charter.The root cause of the instability and the threat to peace and security throughout the southern African region is apartheid. Despite pronouncements to the contrary  the Pretoria regime has continued to catty out  directly and through its surrogates  acts of destabilization against the front-line States. Our appreciation goes to the front-line States for the support they have given to the struggle despite the enormous costs  in both human and material terms to which they have been subjected. The international community should increase assistance to them. They are in the front line in the struggle for the emancipation of peoples and against violations of human rights  of which apartheid is the most gross.Elsewhere in Attica  we welcome the prevailing spirit of reconciliation aimed at solving ongoing conflicts  notably in Angola  Mozambique  the Sudan and Ethiopia. We are equally encouraged by the peace treaty signed between Libya and Chad on 31 August 19Î9. We hope that the Secretary-General's efforts and those of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) with regard to the peace agreement between Morocco and the POLISARK) Front will result in the full implementation of that agreement.The acceptance by Iran and Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) on the termination of the war gave satisfaction to us all. It is our sincere hope that the negotiations between the two countries  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  on an overall settlement will be successful.With regard to Afghanistan  Uganda welcomed the signing of the Geneva Agreements intended to put an end to the years of bloody and brutal war. All parties to the Agreements have an obligation to honour them. In this regard we note with appreciation that the withdrawal of Soviet forces was completed within the agreed time frame.The Middle East region remains embroiled in a state of violence owing to Israel's Intransigence and refusal to accept the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. The core of the Middle East conflict has always been and remains the question of Palestine. Last year there was hope that there would be movement ahead when the Palestine National Council proclaimed a State of Palestine and indicated its willingness to accept General Assembly resolution 181 (II) and Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and therefore the existence of Israel. Rather than grasp the olive branch  Israel has continued to obstruct all meaningful proposals meant to bring about a durable and just settlement. Israel continues to build more settlements in the occupied territories and carry out violations of the human rights of the Palestinian people.The Secretary-General in his report states that he is  troubled by recent declarations that  in effect  question the applicability of Security Council resolution 242 (1967). Since its unanimous adoption  the resolution has been regarded as the corner-stone of any comprehensive settlement to be reached.  (A/44/1  p. 7)My delegation agrees with the Secretary-General  Israel must not be allowed to scuttle this long-standing international consensus.In this connection we reiterate the call for the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East in which all the parties  including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  should participate. 1 wish to take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-General and President Mubarak of Egypt for the efforts they have made to this end. Such a conference would promote a just  durable and comprehensive solution.The situation in Lebanon continues to be a source of anguish to my delegation. The fratricidal conflict has resulted in a heavy toll in both human and material terms. Uganda urges all the parties to come together and place the interests of their country above group considerations in order to resolve the crisis. We support the efforts of the Tripartite Committee of the Arab Heads of State to this end and welcome the cease-fire thus achieved.With regard to the problem in Cyprus  we are encouraged by the progress of the intercommunal talks being carried out under the auspices of the Secretary-General. In his report he states that they are now at a critical juncture where an overall settlement that will safeguard the legitimate Interests and meet the concerns of both communities seems possible. Uganda continues to support the Independence  sovereignty and territorial Integrity of Cyprus.The people of Kampuchea have long been victims of war. It was our hope that the Paris International Conference on Cambodia  held In August this year  would lead to a comprehensive settlement and a free and Independent Cambodia. It Is a matter for regret that this was not possible despite the progress achieved In elaborating the detailed aspects of elements for a comprehensive solution. We appeal to all parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General.For much of this decade the situation in Central America has been tense and volatile. Uganda's position has always remained unequivocal  namely  that the people of the region should be left to solve their problems without external Interference. We have always supported the process of constructive dialogue Initiated by the Contadora Group  which eventually culminated in the Esquipulas II Agreement by Central American Presidents. This Agreement  arrived at after an intensive series of negotiations  has eased tensions and created an atmosphere of trust  reconciliation and peaceful coexistence.Uganda has been following the developments in the Korean peninsula and welcomes and encourages the current efforts towards reconciliation by the two Koreas. Our position remains the same we support the peaceful ramification of Korea without external interference.As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement Uganda welcomes the improving relations between East and West  and especially between the two super-Powers. We are happy to observe that their intense and bitter rivalry  which we have always deplored  is being replaced by a spirit of constructive co-operation. The signing of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate-range and shorter-range missiles by the United States and the Soviet Union was a historic landmark which marked a turning-point. Uganda is encouraged by the declared intentions of the two countries to reduce their strategic offensive weapons by 50 per cent. We shall  however  continue to live under the threat posed by those weapons as long as there is no large-scale dismantling of armaments and forces. We shall continue to warn against the danger of the reduction in weapons being compensated for by the introduction of new and more sophisticated ones  which might be equally devastating and destabilizing. There is an urgent necessity to conclude a comprehensive test-ban treaty. The process that has already begun towards the convening of a conference to amend the partial test-ban Treaty of 1963  should be used to achieve a comprehensive nuclear-weapon-test ban.Next year there will be a review conference for  the non-proliferation Treaty  to which Uganda is a State party and which is due for renewal in 1995  Article VI imposes an obligation on nuclear-weapon States to negotiate in good faith towards nuclear disarmament. Failure by the nuclear Powers to comply with their obligations undermines confidence in and the efficacy of the non-proliferation Treaty. The commitment given in the bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union drastically to reduce the stockpiles of chemical weapons is a very welcome development. It is our hope  however  that this will soon be followed by a total ban on chemical weapons  thus completing the work begun in 1984 by the Conference on Disarmament.Uganda has always maintained that nuclear and conventional weapons are complementary aspects of the objective of complete and general disarmament and that they equally require urgent action. Regional conflicts are very often encouraged by outside- Powers and the merchants of those deadly weapons. A number of third world countries have fallen prey and have become engaged in an arms race  thus diverting valuable resources from the productive sectors. The human toll of those conflicts since the Second World War has been very high. There is a need to give effect to measures that promote resources for development. Uganda strongly believes in good-neighbourliness and has  through joint commissions and dialogue with our neighbours  endeavoured to enhance mutual confidence and increase regional co-operation.The linkage between disarmament and development is now well appreciated. The world spends a trillion dollars annually on armaments. This Is equivalent to the debt burden which hangs like a sword of Damocles over the third world countries. Needless to say  in many cases a large part of this debt is accounted for by the procurement of armaments. The importance of the release of resources from disarmament to development  therefore  need net be overemphasised. Global security cannot be achieved without eradicating world-wide poverty  disease and injustice. Lack of economic and social advancement  large-scale m employ men t and underemployment  scarcity of resources  degradation of the environment and trafficking in drugs threaten international peace and security as much as do military threats. The world economic is in disarray and afflicted by severe imbalances and inequities. The improvement in relations between East and West contrasts poignantly with the widening gap between North and South in economic relations. While the industrialized countries have continued to register growth  the standard of living in many developing countries has declined. The reality in many of the developing countries is one of unmet basic needs  of child mortality  of illiteracy  disease and hunger.A critical problem facing the developing countries has been the weakening and collapse of primary-commodity prices. This has been extremely damaging to out export earnings and growth. In 1986  for example  Africa's earnings from commodity exports fell by 319 billion. Since then the situation has become worse. In the case of Uganda the collapse of coffee prices this year has meant a loss of almost half our expected export earnings. There is need to ensure fair and predictable prices for the primary commodities of developing countries. We are  therefore  encouraged by the coming into force of the agreement establishing the common fund for commodities and hope that Member States will give it all necessary support.Deteriorating terms of trade have been compounded by the debt burden  the volatile exchange rates  high interest rates and the decline in official development assistance. All those factors account for the scandalous net transfer of resources from developing countries to developed countries. According to the World Bank those net transfers increased from $38 billion in 1967 to $50 billion in 1988. The least-developed countries  especially those in sub-Saharan Africa  have been the roost affected. For instance  the Economic Commission for Africa estimates that in 1987 Africa transferred more than 31 billion net to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) alone.Equally critical for those countries are the structural-adjustment programmes of the IMF/World Bank. In their present format those programmes  however well intentioned  have tended to address the short-term economic disequilibrium of the economies of those countries. Long-term economic problems remain unresolved and pose serious threats to their future growth and development. In addition  the impact of those measures on the social sector  notably education and health  which are critical factors for long-term development and transformation  has been most depressing.There is urgent need for increased efforts in the search for a viable  conceptual and practical framework for economic structural-adjustment programmes  in keeping with their long-term development objectives and strategies  as called for in General Assembly resolution 43/27. It is in that context that  based on their own experience of the 1980s  the African Heads of State have adopted the African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programmes  which we commend to the Assembly.We are currently witnessing a trend towards deeper regional economic integration and the formation of bigger trading blocs in Europe and North America  last year I had occasion to warn from this rostrum that the present international economic and social structure perpetuates the oasis of privilege and affluence in a desert of dearth and deprivation. It is our hope that the emergence of those blocs will not aggravate that tendency. This is both a challenge and an example for the developing countries concerning the nature of the factors that will govern international economic relations in the twenty-first century. We believe that long-term structural and economic transformation in Africa will depend on the success of the current efforts towards economic integration in our region  That is why we In Uganda take out participation in the Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern Africa  the Organization of African Unity and other regional organizations as a priority.The urgency of restructuring the existing world economic system cannot be overemphasized. The Uruguay Round on multilateral trade negotiations  the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Least-Developed Countries and the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the revitalization of economic growth should provide useful input for the elaboration of the new international development strategy for the 1990s. The strategy should be aimed at providing for long-term growth  economic transformation and sustainable development.The problems of the environment vividly bring out the inescapable fact of our interdependence. Uganda welcomes the proposed 1992 international conference on the environment and development. That conference must provide an opportunity and a challenge for all to agree on practical measures necessary to protect the environment for the future based on the concept of environmentally sound and sustainable development. The Kampala Declaration on Sustainable Development adapted by the African Regional Conference on Environment and Development held at Kampala from 12 to 16 June 1989 identified 7 key priority areas that should be addressed  namely  manning demographic changes and pressures; achieving food self-sufficiency and food security? ensuring efficient and equitable use of water resources; securing greater energy self-sufficiency  optimising industrial production  maintaining species and ecosystems and halting and reversing desertification.In the social fields the war against transnational crime  including narcotic drug-trafficking and abuse  has appropriately been the focus of many speakers. Uganda is committed to fighting this war and is party to various international instruments in that regard. We are in the process of ratifying the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs end Psychotropic Substances. Drugs encourage corruption  undermine the rule of law and result in moral and physical degeneration. Institutions such as the United Nations Institute for Crime Prevention in Uganda  which is still in its infancy  should be helped to do research that can lead to crime prevention  including drug-trafficking. The prevalence of drugs should also be looked at in the wider context of primary-commodity exports. Here there is also an inescapable linkage between increased drug-trafficking to affluent countries and the collapse of primary-commodity prices. It is no accident that the countries most involved in drug production are also dependent on primary commodities  especially coffee. Putting the international coffee agreement in jeopardy could not  therefore  have been helpful in the fight against drug trafficking.The observance of human tights remains a crucial objective of the Uganda Government  both in its domestic and in its foreign policy. We believe that human rights encompass the right to an adequate standard of living. We are committed to the investigation of all human-rights violations and to the punishment of the culprits. It is for that reason that Uganda established a commission to investigate violations of human rights in the past. With the institution of the office of Inspector General of Government  respect for human rights in Uganda has been very much enhanced.Uganda believes that the right of the child is paramount. We therefore support the draft convention on the rights of the child adapted by the Human Rights Commission  which is before the General Assembly. We also support the proposal for a world summit meeting on children. As we approach the dawn of the new century  the problems which face the international community cannot be underrated. The United Nations has a critical role in the management of our interdependence and in fashioning the appropriate global response to our common problems. Hence  the need of the moment is to strengthen and enhance its capability. Uganda has been following closely the reform process  which is now at its advanced stage. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 41/213  the reform process  should maintain its characteristic of being a comprehensive whole. Its implementation  therefore  must be carried out in an integrated  balanced and timely manner. â> consensus has yet been reached on the reforms in the economic and social fields in spite of their vital importance. That is unfortunate. It is our hope that this will soon be rectified.As the twentieth century draws to a close we must cast out eyes across the wide horizon and reform the present international system in such a way that our legacy to future generations becomes a framework in which interdependence is beneficial to all the people in developed and developing countries alike."
"142",7146,"UKR",44,1989,"ï»¿It gives the delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic great pleasure to greet the representative of Nigeria  Mr. Garba  as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Many years of co-operation with him have convinced us that he will fulfil his high duties with honour and dignity. Please convey to him our heartiest congratulations on his election.The prospects of an era of peace in international relations and of the consistent implementation of related tasks for multilateral co-operation among States can open up an entirely new phase in world history. If that were to come to pass  succeeding generations  saved from the scourge of war  would pay fitting tribute to those present in this Hall as contributors to and joint authors of that process. It is noteworthy that a number of representatives  as well as the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization  found it necessary to recall the fiftieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War and to speak about its lessons. The Ukrainian delegation deems that appropriate and logical. The peoples of the Soviet Union  including the Ukrainian people  bore the brunt of the war and sustained its heaviest losses. At the same time  they made the most significant contribution towards saving the peoples of Europe from Fascist enslavement. The liberating mission of the Soviet Union is indelibly printed in the grateful memory of nations. To forget  let alone to ignore the fact  would be to desecrate the sacred memory of the fallen and to insult the living. The lessons of history shall not fall into oblivion.The wheel of history cannot be reversed. The inviolability of post-war borders constitutes the foundation of peaceful relations in Europe. We share the clear and unambiguous position expressed in that regard by the Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany  Mr. Hans-Dietrich Genscher.We are encouraged and heartened to see the promising and positive changes in international relations gathering momentum and becoming ever more teal and tangible. Tensions have eased and confrontation has diminished  fruitful political dialogue is emerging between States  confidence is growing and injecting an entirely new  peaceful note into international relations. There is a growing trend towards ensuring global security not through an arms build-up but through agreed reductions in arms. A new world order is taking shape based on the primacy of international law  the renunciation of confrontation and enmity in favour of confidence and good-neighbourliness  and mutual regard for the interests of countries and peoples. There is a growing awareness of the need to elaborate generally acceptable approaches to global challenges  to seek universal consensus and to achieve comprehensive international security in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.The time has come for concrete action that would allow  without excessive reliance on methods involving military force  the activation of the mechanism of political and legal restraint  as well as the peacemaking potential of the non-military components of security. The United Nations can and should play a major role in that respect. The Ukrainian delegation is in favour of making the most effective use of United Nations potential to prevent crises and maintain international peace and security. We are firmly convinced that it is through the United Nations and with its assistance that a secure and non-violent world can be established  the first outlines of which can be discerned even today.The path leading to such a world is not an easy one. There remain many roadblocks  chief among which is the arms race. Only disarmament can ensure progress towards a secure future. The beneficial influence of the first practical results of disarmament on the overall political climate in the world can already be felt today. Those results are clearly stimulating negotiations in other areas.The order of the day is nuclear disarmament. In that context  an early conclusion of an agreement between the USSR and the United States on a 50 per cent reduction of strategic offensive arms is of paramount importance  as is the eventual complete elimination of nuclear weapons. The strategy of nuclear deterrence is clearly indefensible. It essentially means the perpetuation of nuclear weapons with all the fatal consequences they entail.The question of halting all nuclear testing has become of special importance. It is central in keeping the general nuclear-weapons situation under control. The Ukrainian delegation supports the calls for early consideration by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament of the problem relating to a comprehensive nuclear-test ban. The proposals to extend the 1963 Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere  in Outer Space and under Water to underground tests could be considered as one way of addressing the problem. A mutual Soviet-United States moratorium on all nuclear tests could serve as a prelude to a verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban agreement.Should the armsÂ· race extend to outer space  international security would be undermined in an unpredictable way  and the threat of global catastrophe would increase immeasurably. Outer space must remain peaceful and open for international co-operation in its exploration for the benefit of all nations. In that context  we have high hopes for the Soviet-United States dialogue and the intensified effort towards practical results on the work of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. Today real conditions exist for the total and global elimination of chemical stockpiles and a ban on development and production of these weapons. The encouraging progress achieved in Geneva  where work on a convention banning chemical weapons and eliminating stockpiles of them is in its final stage  as well as the Soviet-United States approach to this issue  are proof of that. The Ukrainian delegation believes that the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session must urge the Conference on Disarmament to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion at the earliest possible date. The conclusion of a convention would undoubtedly make a major contribution to the process of real disarmament  started by the elimination of Soviet and United States intermediate and shorter-range nuclear missiles  and would signify its diversification and its elevation to the multilateral level.There should be no areas closed to disarmament talks. A comprehensive approach to solving disarmament problems would appear to be the most productive. The progress of negotiations in Vienna confirms that this is an entirely justified and realistic way of dealing with the issue. Proposals and counter-proposals advanced by the War saw Treaty and North Atlantic Treaty Organization member States have opened up a teal prospect of reaching early agreement on a gradual switchover to a defensive military doctrine and to the development of armed forces on the principle of reasonable sufficiency.As the socialist countries members of the Warsaw Treaty organization stated at the Bucharest meeting of the Political Consultative Committee  they see the immediate goal of negotiations to be the establishment  as early as in a first-stage agreement  of common ceilings  equal for both alliances  on the aggregate numbers of troops and the amounts of main types of armaments in Europe and its various parts. New levels would be considerably lower than the current lowest levels of either side. Drastic reductions of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe in the next few years  coupled with a phased reduction and  ultimately  elimination of tactical nuclear weapons  would be are effective means of reducing the risk of war. It would make the disarmament process universal and contribute to enhanced confidence.On the subject of confidence-building measures  let me stress the special importance that the Ukrainian SSR attaches to developing and expanding measures. We are in favour of extending confidence-building  observation and limitation measures to cover all kinds of military activity  including naval and air force activities. kind of armed forces or armaments should be exempt from the negotiating process.Our position of principle is to ensure a dynamic transition from individual confidence-building measures  openness and glasnost in international relations to a large-scale policy of confidence in all spheres of military activity without exception as an integral part of security and peace on Earth. A sine qua non for ensuring international security is an effective verification regime. We are firmly convinced that it should embrace all aspects of the disarmament process  leading to the establishment of a comprehensive disarmament verification system. The United Nations can  and indeed must  make a substantial contribution to it.Recently we have often heard concern voiced at the fact that multilateral disarmament measures are lagging behind bilateral ones. This situation should be remedied. Prospects of multilateral disarmament would look much better if the Security Council  pursuant to Article 26 of the United Nations Charter  were to take & meaningful interest in the  maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion ... of the world's human and economic resources  for the cause of armaments. In other words  it should seek to ensure security at the lowest possible levels of armament in individual States - levels sufficient for their defence but insufficient for offence.The initial steps taken towards real disarmament open up prospects of channelling resources released in this way to meeting the needs of social and economic development. The problem of converting military production to civilian use is now being addressed in practical terms.Conversion undoubtedly poses complicated problems  involving retooling and reorienting plants and re-employing and retraining personnel  and so on. It therefore seems all the more necessary to pool our efforts to solve those problems at all levels - national  regional and global - drawing upon the experience so far accumulated in this area.We haveÂ· every hope that the United Nations and its specialized agencies will conduct specific studies and make recommendations on individual aspects of the problem. It is essential  however  that the United Nations should be able to collect all information available and thus become a kind of centre for developing a global strategy on converting military production. Many conversion studies conducted both in the East end in the West have demonstrated that conversion not only is feasible but will also have positive social and economic effects.What is becoming increasingly clear is that military expenditures slow down economic  technological and social development. It is to be regretted that that these conclusions have not been supported everywhere. Nevertheless  we would like to hope that a conversion in thinking is not too far off either. What we need is to share our experience on an international scale and to work out together approaches to  and criteria for  converting military production. Disarmament is important - and not just as an end in itself. It should become an additional resource for raising the living standards of peoples and giving them tangible benefits. In our view  the famous phrase  We shall beat swords into ploughshares  is an apt description of the indivisible triad of disarmament  conversion and development.Now let me make one final point on the problems of disarmament. This concerns the role of the public  of parliaments - citizens' diplomacy. We should like to see the international public exerting even more vigorous efforts in the context of the World Campaign for Disarmament. The United Nations seminar on multilateral confidence-building and war-preventing measures held last September in Kiev proved that such projects were useful. The Ukrainian SSR intends to continue its support for activities related to the World Campaign for Disarmament.Over decades the entire system of international relations has been in a state of tension generated by regional conflicts. The last year  however  has brought us the first gleams of hope.We needed a policy that would take into account the realities of the nuclear age so as to make headway in attaining a political settlement of existing crises. We needed new thinking that would give us a view of the world not in the light of confrontation and a balance of forces  but in the light of a balance of interests  We can new speak about a new situation. A chain reaction of positive changes  varying in scale and importance  has affected almost all regional crises. A kind of pattern for settling them is taking shape. Typically  it features a realistic approach to evaluating the actual state of affairs in conflict areas  the political will and readiness to reach compromise  a quest for national reconciliation with no external interference# the use by the major parties to the conflict of negotiating machinery with United Nations mediation and under its auspices  and the establishment of an institution of international guarantors.We are highly appreciative of the contribution made by the United Nations to the drafting and conclusion of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan. The Organization should play a major role now as well  in ending the bloodshed and attaining political solutions in Afghanistan affairs  as provided for in the Geneva Agreements and the resolution adopted at the forty-third session of the General Assembly. The United Nations  and above all  its Secretary-General  are able actively to promote intra-Afghan dialogue and to establish the machinery for a political settlement enlisting the involvement of Afghanistan's neighbours.The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan  Mr. Abdul Wakil  proposed here a clear and constructive plan for an Afghanistan settlement. Regarding the plan's external aspects  the situation around Afghanistan could be best settled by an international conference  to be attended by Afghanistan  Pakistan  Iran  India  China  the United States  the Soviet Union and the country serving as Chairman of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. It would be convened for the purpose of reaching agreement on ending supplies of weapons to the warring parties and guaranteeing Afghanistan's status as a demilitarised and neutral State  friendly towards its neighbours.These provisions would be included in the country's new Constitution. Such an approach to  and a way out of  the crisis is fully in keeping with the imperatives and spirit of the times.The general trend towards improved international relations  reduced tensions  and the diminished risk of war has cleared the way for a settlement in the Middle East. The world has  by and large  come to realize that this calls for collective efforts at an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations which would offer an opportunity for the parties to the conflict to reach a historic compromise. It could undertake an exhaustive examination of the proposals designed to attain a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East. Prospects for a non-violent solution to the impasse caused by a longstanding confrontation have emerged in southern Africa as well. At the same time  it is quite clear that the dynamics and endurance of a solution to the problems facing southern Africa are directly proportional to the speed with which the dismantling of the apartheid regime can proceed  for the regimes is the toot cause of the region's tensions. The international community must do its utmost to bar the apartheid regime's admittance to the third millennium.Encouraging steps have been taken towards a real settlement in Central America. They make it incumbent upon all the members of the international community to support the still fragile process towards reaching a final settlement that would accommodate the interests of all the parties concerned. We commend highly the agreement reached by the five Central American Presidents as well as their awareness of the region's problems and their wisdom  audacity and realism. We welcome the constructive and flexible position of the Nicaraguan Government  which is complying faithfully and scrupulously with its obligations and showing its genuine interest in bringing peace to the region.Like all other States  we have an interest in establishing a zone of peace  co-operation and neutrality in South-East Asia. The road towards this goal lies through achieving a settlement in Cambodia. The withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia creates the necessary conditions and prerequisites for a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian problem. This involves measures to prevent civil war and genocide and to adopt international guarantees for Cambodia's status as an independent  peaceful  neutral and non-aligned State.The implementation of proposals put forward by the People's Democratic Republic of Korea on the peaceful  democratic reunification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from the territory of that nation would promote peace and security on the Korean peninsula and clear the way for a unified Korea to join the United Nations.We advocate broad and constructive interaction among all members of the international community in eliminating hotbeds of tension through political means on a just  honest and  hence  solid basis. All States  great and small alike  and international organizations - above all  the United Nations - have an important contribution to make to this end.Our Organization has not yet fully tapped its potential in conflict-prevention. The resources of the Security Council and the possibilities of the Secretary-General have not yet been fully utilized. We share the conclusions in the report of the Secretary-General on the role and significance of preventive diplomacy.While duly recognizing the current positive trends in political relations among States  we cannot but note the lack of real progress in the development of the economic interaction of States. The situation of the world economy remains unstable  and existing problems are getting worse.The economic situation of developing countries is particularly disturbing. They are still suffering from backwardness  external debt  inequality in international trade and various kinds of protectionist and other unlawful measures used by the strong against the weak. The present system of international economic relations does not meet the interests of the overwhelming majority of States and is undemocratic.The growing economic interdependence of States and the internationalisation of economic life has set the stage for the development of co-operation and healthier international economic relations. These goals have been advanced by the production  at the United Nations  of the idea of international economic security  aimed at achieving an equitable  generally advantageous and generally acceptable state of the world economy and international economic relations and at creating conditions for peaceful coexistence and co-operation among all States  regardless of their level of development or of their socio-economic system.In recent years the environment issue has firmly established itself on the list of international priority problems. The problem of environmental protection can be resolved effectively only at the global level. We very much appreciate the role of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in mobilizing the efforts of the world community to prevent environmental catastrophe. We need to develop and improve the potential of the United Nations in monitoring  assessing and predicting threats to the environment and in providing relief assistance in case of environmental emergencies. The Ukrainian SSR supports the idea of setting up  within the framework of the United Nations  a centre for urgent environmental assistance. The work of that centre could bring the conservation efforts of international organizations to a new and higher level and would be a practical contribution to overcoming environmental crises.The international conference on environment and development  scheduled for 1992  will have to draft a world strategy for environmental survival. The proposed mandate of the conference is almost perfectly in keeping with the goals and purposes of the international environmental security concept initiated by the Ukrainian SSR  together with Czechoslovakia and other countries.We hear more and more people demanding that protection of the environmental health of the planet be placed on a solid foundation of international co-operation. That gives us the hope that environmental security will be ensured and that the environment will not suffer irreparable damage. As was pointed out at the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union  it is criminal to drain the world economy through the arms race and to ignore the need for preserving man's habitat. Today  more than ever before  the correctness of a country's historical direction is to be judged by the human dimension of its domestic and foreign policy. A State's participation in united Nations humanitarian activities and its rejection of double standards is a clear indication that it cares about people and is striving to preserve universal human values. I should like to address just one aspect of this topic.Virtually all those- who have spoken during the general debate have voiced great concern about the problem of drug abuse. Possessing huge financial resources  criminal drug trafficking syndicates are undermining the political and economic foundations of States and ate entangling governmental and judicial institutions in a web of corruption. Millions of people are losing their health  and even their lives  to drugs. No one can overcome this evil single-handedly. Only joint efforts can produce the desired result. International conferences on drug-abuse control have demonstrated that the world community is serious in combating this scourge. The Convention against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and other instruments adapted to fight drug abuse were the result of the growing awareness among States of the global nature of this problem.The international co-operation that has clearly emerged in this field must be developed further. What is necessary is close interaction and co-ordinated efforts in combating drug trafficking and drug abuse. We believe that the United Nations could take the next logical step in this direction by proclaiming a decade for combating drug abuse and illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs.The Ukrainian delegation is prepared to submit a draft resolution on the subject for consideration at this session of the General Assembly. The General Assembly could ask the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Narcotic Drug? to draft a programme for such a decade to be adopted by the General Assembly.At the heart of such Ð° programme as we see it  there would be measures for the effective implementation of conventions to fight drug abuse and the 1987 Interdisciplinary Plan  as well as activities sponsored by the United Nations Fund to combat drug abuse  and the integration of efforts at the national level. The convening of an appropriate international conference could constitute one of the stages of the programme. The conference could review progress in implementing the programme for the decade and decide on further steps.Finally  the Ukrainian SSR is prepared to co-operate actively with all countries in strengthening the international legal order and drafting specific measures to enhance the role of international law. In our view  a decade of international law  proposed by the non-aligned countries  could promote this objective. Our policy of asserting the supremacy of international law is intimately related to the process of creating our own State based on a genuine rule of law. Bringing the norms of domestic legislation  into full conformity with its international obligations  the Ukrainian SSR stands in solidarity with all States that are also striving to achieve higher standards of legal protection for the individual.The renaissance of the United Nations is linked with renewed hopes for a peaceful future. We hope that efforts to create a world in much peaceful  civilized relations among States and nations rule supreme will meet with the support of all delegations attending the forty-fourth session. We hope that the work of the General Assembly will impart a new impetus to progress towards a more secure future and help turn the United Nations into an effective instrument of peace."
"143",7192,"URY",44,1989,"ï»¿During the debate at the fortieth session of the General Assembly four years ago  President Sanguinetti announced to the world community from this very rostrum that Uruguay had resumed its traditional path of political democracy  and was determined to respect and to enforce respect domestically for all human rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic  and further announced his firm resolve to resume active participation on the global stage of international relations in the pursuit of peace  universal respect for human rights and the equality of all nations  based on respect for national sovereignty and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.Six months prior to the conclusion of President Sanguinetti's constitutional term  I have the honour to mount the same rostrum to announce to this international community that today those intentions have been fully realized.Indeed  within a few weeks  elections will be held in Uruguay to elect all the authorities who will be responsible for the destiny of the country for the next five years. This fact  commonplace in the political tradition of a democratic country  is particularly significant in out case  since it represents the culmination of a period of democratic recovery during which full respect for the Constitution has been restored? all individual rights have been scrupulously observed  and national reconciliation has been achieved  inter alia by a general amnesty ratified by popular mandate. Law and justice have been restored  and the country has been rescued from a declining economic situation through the vigorous revitalization of the external sector and the application of stabilizing policies which have allowed reasonable product growth  a decrease in unemployment and an increase in real earnings.On the international front  Uruguay has honoured all its commitments  including those of a financial nature which entailed - then and today - considerable sacrifices. It has actively contributed  at times beyond the power of its political weight and its material resources  to efforts aimed at reinforcing international peace  security and co-operation. It has embarked upon a firm policy of regional and sub regional integration and participates actively with other democracies in the hemisphere to co-ordinate positions in order to satisfy our common interests. In short  the Government of Uruguay is acting on the international scene  secure in the moral and political authority it derives from the right to represent a free  democratic  stable and peace-loving society. This task of democratic consolidation has been successful but also extremely difficult. As President Sanguinetti said to this Assembly in 1985:""Democracy is a fragile flower; ... it only grows aid survives in the right soil and the right climate. A genuine democracy based on respect for the individual and an the periodical  free advice of the people can be preserved only within an economic context that allows its citizens to provide for their basic material and spiritual needs. ... When this condition is not fulfilled  and poverty and unemployment prevail  violence emerges and is unleashed  the powers of disorder take advantage of the fertile soil  the fabric of society disintegrates and  in the international sphere  political loyalties become erratic."" (A/40/PV.6  p. 12)Indeed  democracy is never limited to a purely political dimension  nor is it a sufficient condition to ensure freedom for all the people.The economic and social component of a democratic society is what ultimately determines its feasibility aid stability. It is for this reason that the question posed by the foreign Ministers of the Group of 8 when considering the problem of foreign debt is a valid one today: How much poverty can freedom withstand?Like democracy in other Latin American countries and other regions of the world  democracy in Uruguay has been constantly threatened by a severe economic crisis unprecedented in its history.We are aware - and this is always worth repeating - of our share of responsibility in the task of overcoming the crisis and promoting development and economic growth. We know that that is possible only through our own efforts  through the formulation and application of our own policies and  particularly  through our own sacrifices. But we are also aware that  despite the social and political cost of these adjustment processes  the expected benefits will not be obtained without greater participation and commitment by the industrialized countries  particularly in the areas of international finance and trade.The issue of underdevelopment  therefore  remains the major world problem faced by mankind. The growth achieved by a few Asian countries cannot hide the fact that there has been significant regression in the social indicators of many countries in Latin America and Africa. That bears eloquent testimony to the seriousness of the situation and the political risk to their governing institutions  and consequently to world peace.The vast foreign debt which weighs so heavily on many of our countries has reversed the flow of financial resources  which now runs from South to North. The task of turning the tide cannot be delayed  since this debt is paralysing all our efforts to achieve economic development and democratic stability.It is encouraging to note that creditor countries have new accepted the principle of shared responsibility in the foreign-debt problem  and have agreed that this problem is not simply financial but also political and social. It is also noteworthy and encouraging that creditor Governments appear willing to consider formulas to help the constrained economies of debtor nations.In this respect  the agreement between Mexico and its international bank creditors has set a precedent regarding the feasibility of the Brady philosophy and has aroused legitimate hopes and expectations in the rest of the debtor nations.Without a pragmatic approach to the debt problem there will be no development and no economic growth; without these prerequisites it will be very difficult to continue to believe in democracy  and without democracy world stability and peace will be very hard to maintain.What we need today is a revolutionary change in our ideas and policies with respect to international economics  ultimately leading to the formulation of a new development strategy. The starting point of that strategy should be recognition of the interdependence of all States  whatever their size or economic or military power; and the objective should be to ensure that this interdependence is viewed as guaranteeing greater predictability and stability in world trade and economic relations and a more just distribution of the benefits.This new international strategy for development should be dynamic  flexible and  above all  concrete and precise in the formulation of measures designed to fight poverty  to eliminate protectionism and discrimination in international trade  and to facilitate access by all developing countries to technology and to the financial and economic markets of industrialized nations.The environmental dimension should be an essential ingredient in the new international development strategy. The deterioration of the environment has become a matter of concern to the entire international community and there is no doubt it will continue to be a matter of concern in the years to come.There can be no doubt that the environment must  be protected and that each State must assume responsibility and take action in this respect for its own well-being and for that of other peoples of the world. But it is also true thatthe correct solution to the problem requires sincere and broad international co-operation to ensure that the cost of protecting the environment is not borne by only a few countries which ate still struggling for full development of their un-exploited natural resources. In no case - and this is more important still - should protection of the environment become a new form of conditionality to which the sovereign decisions of countries still requiring international co-operation for their development would be subordinated.In summary  Uruguay is conscious of the urgent need to protect the environment-  but we are also aware that this is a task requiring the participation and efforts of the entire international community and that it should be carried out in a way compatible with the national sovereignty of all nations.However  the implementation of a development policy that guarantees both the protection of the environment and the rational use of natural resources requires the provision of financial resources and appropriate technologies not available to all the countries in the world.As we stated last year and repeat today: the technological dependence of the developing countries is not only a factor inhibiting their economic development  but also as a serious threat to their political sovereignty as that posed by foreign aggression.The cost of transferring financial and technological resources to developing countries represents barely a marginal fraction of the funds used by the super-Powers in the arms race  for which they invoke reasons of national security. They forget that reasons of national survival would make it mandatory for them to allocate more than a marginal fraction of that overall expenditure to the transfer of resources and technology to developing countries  thereby facilitating theirparticipation in the common task of protecting both world peace and the quality of the environment.In dealing with the question of the environment  the international community must resort to the basic mechanism of co-operation between nations because we are faced with a common danger  affecting us all  and there is no political system or degree of development or military Power than can give any State the slightest immunity against it.Unfortunately  it is not only dangers to the environment that indiscriminately affect all nations and peoples. There are other reasons forcing us to resort to and develop the mechanisms of global solidarity and co-operation. Terrorism and drug trafficking  which at times appear to be complementary phenomena  continue to wreak destruction and havoc  despite the universal revulsion they arouse.Uruguay unequivocally condemns terrorism. For us  any terrorist act is inhuman and cruel  violates the most sacred human rights and reveals the basest and most destructive feelings of men. There is no purpose  no cause  no issue  however noble  that can justify the commission of a terrorist act. For that reason  Uruguay will contribute  without qualifications based on motives or purposes  to efforts directed at establishing new legal measures and at strengthening existing ones providing for the eradication of this scourge from the face of the earth.With respect to drug trafficking  we are concerned at the rate at which it has expanded and at the vast power behind it  but at the same time we are encouraged to see that the governments of consumer nations have become aware of their responsibilities and that producer nations have shouldered the risks involved in an open war against drug traffickers. In this connection  it is my duty  and my pleasure  to express to the Government of President Virgilio Barco Vargas and to the people of Colombia the solidarity of the Government of Uruguay in respect of recent events in our sister Republic  and our admiration for the courage with which Colombians are tackling this problem.The political climate that now prevails is perhaps the most propitious in four decades for the successful initiation and implementation of undertakings necessitating the willingness of Governments to co-operate with each other. Ideological dogmatism and political inflexibility appear to be losing ground in the face of realism and common sense. Over the last few months  we have embarked on a new era of dialogue and collaboration  which has translated into a cessation of hostilities  the reaching of agreements  and the establishment of contacts and channels of communication. All of this has led to the solution  or imminent solution  of several regional conflicts.The cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq; the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan that has already taken place; the recent efforts to normalize the situation in Kampuchea; the December 1988 agreements on southern Africa and the beginning of the self-determination process in Namibia; the agreements on New Caledonia; the contacts concerning Western Sahara; the new surge in the Central American peace process following the regional presidential summit last August; and the promising resumption of dialogue between Argentina and the United Kingdom with a view to settling their differences directly - these are manifestations of this desire for peace  and proof of the sterility and futility of confrontation  intolerance and misguided nationalism.This new spirit is evident also in the changes introduced by numerous countries in the principles and objectives of their domestic policies  which have led them to greater openness  both internally and externally  thereby strengthening the prospects for international peace and co-operation. 1 am referring to political evolution on the domestic front in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries  as well as to the steps taken towards democracy by the last authoritarian regimes in South America  which are evidence of a less dogmatic political vision that  fortunately  appears to be spreading in almost all regions of the world.However  there remain areas in which the voices of peace go unheeded  First  the human-rights situation in the world is still far from satisfactory. The international community knows that the important progress made in the political field will remain precarious while vast sectors of the world's peoples are unable fully to enjoy their human rights.There can be no doubt whatsoever that no progress - whether economic  social  political or moral â will have a firm foundation so long as any vestiges of racism and racial discrimination remain  and in particular while practices such as apartheid continue. South Africa's persistence in disregarding the resolutions of the United Nations will not stifle the persistence of the rest of the world in reclaiming for that country the full force of the equality and dignity of the human race.The work of the United Nations in developing human rights and establishing the means of guaranteeing respect for them must continue  with the support of the international community. A very important step has been taken with the drafting of the convention on the rights of the child  which we trust will soon become  for every State  the appropriate ethical and legal framework for improving the status of children.The Middle East conflict continues to threaten world peace and to cost the parties involved a high price in human life and in moral and material damage. Nevertheless  signals are beginning to come from both sides - signals that are helping to generate the climate necessary for a negotiated solution. For Israel  this would mean lasting peace within safe borders  and  for the Palestinians  the possibility of exercising freely their right to self-determination.In this region  we are also particularly concerned about the tragic situation in Lebanon - a country with which we have many links  and whose long-suffering people are the victims of an unjust and senseless war  with the Resulting death and devastation with which we are all too familiar.Uruguay has raised its voice in the past  and does so again  to call on all the parties involved to intensify their efforts to achieve a final solution to the conflict. This implies the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanese territory and the harmonization  by democratic means  of domestic differences. In this regard  we wish every success for the mediation undertaken by several heads of State of the League of Arab States. We trust that the pursuit of peace in Lebanon will succeed and that this country will once again be as prosperous and peaceful as it once was.These problems  as well as other situations that threaten peace  are this year  as in previous years  difficult challenges to which the General Assembly should respond by trying to reconcile the specific interests of each nation withthe general interests of the international community. We are aware that this is a task fraught with difficulties  but at the same time we are encouraged because we know  Mr. President  that under your enlightened and expert direction  we shall achieve the desired results.I should like to conclude by expressing our sincere congratulations to Mr. Dante Caputo on his intelligent and effective presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-third session  and also to the Secretary-General  whose dynamism  tact and commitment have strengthened the role of his office within the Organization and have been an essential factor in enhancing its prestige through his successful intervention in the peaceful solution of a number of regional conflicts."
"144",7240,"USA",44,1989,"ï»¿I am honoured to address the General Assembly today at the beginning of its forty-fourth session. I should like to congratulate Joseph Garba of Nigeria  a distinguished diplomat  on his election as President of this session of the General Assembly  and I wish him success in his presidency.I feel a great personal pleasure on this occasion  for this is a homecoming for both Barbara and me. The memories of my time here in 1971 and 1972 are still with me today - the human moments  the humorous moments that are part of even the highest undertaking.With the Assembly's permission  I should like to share one story from one of the many meetings of the Security Council. I was the Permanent Representative of the United States  and I was 45 minutes late for the meeting. All 45 minutes were filled by the first speaker to take the floor  and when I walked in and took my seat the speaker paused  with great courtesy  and said: ""I welcome the Permanent Representative of the United States. And now  for his benefit  I will start my speech all over again  from the beginning.""That is a true story  at that moment. differences of alliance and ideology didn't matter. The universal groan that went up around that table from every representative present  and the laughter that followed united us all. Today  I would like to begin by recognising - again  a personal privilege - the current Permanent Representatives with whom I served  Ambassador Dugersuren  Ambassador Martinez Ordonez. Ambassador Pabetafika and Permanent Observer Dube. It is wonderful to look around and see so any familiar faces - foreign ministers  members of the Secretariat  and delegates. Of course  the Secretary-General  you were the Permanent representative of your country when we served together. Under-Secretary-General Farah. you were a Permanent Representative back then too. Ambassador Aguilar was here then and is now back. It is an honour to be back with you in this historic Hall  and I apologize if   have forgotten any of you old enough to have served in 1971 and 1972.The United Nations was established forty-four years ago upon the ashes of war and amidst great hopes. The UN can do great things. No  the United Nations is not perfect  it is not a panacea for the world's problem. But it is a vital forum where the nations of the world seek to replace conflict with consensus  and it must remain a forum for peace. The UN has the support of the United States of America. In recent years  the war of words that is often echoed in this Hall has been giving way to a new mood. We have seen a welcome shift from polemics to peace-keeping. United Nations Peace-keepers have given their lives in service to the United Nations. Today  should like to remember one of those soldiers of peace  an American on a mission of peace under the United Nations flag  on a mission for all the world  a man of unquestioned bravery and unswerving  dedication to the United Nations ideal - Lieutenant-Colonel William Richard Higgins. I call on the General Assembly to condemn the murder of this soldier of peace and to call on those responsible to have the decency to return his remains to his family. Let us all - right now  right here - dedicate ourselves and our nations to the cause that Colonel Higgins served so selflessly.The founders of this historic institution believed that it was here that the nations of the world might come to agree that law  not force  shall govern. And the United Nations can play a fundamental role in the central issue of our time  for today  there is an idea at work around the globe  an idea of undeniable force - and that idea is freedom. Freedom's advance is evident everywhere.- Central Europe and Hungary  where State and society are now in the midst of a movement towards political pluralism and a free-market economy  where the barrier that once enforced an unnatural division between Hungary and its neighbours to the west has been torn down and replaced by a new hope for the future  a new hope in freedom. We see freedom at work in Poland  where  in deference to the will of the people  the Communist Party has relinquished its monopoly on power  and indeed in the Soviet Union  where the world hears the voices of people no longer afraid to speak out or to assert the right to rule themselves.But freedom's march is not confined to a single continent or to the developed world alone. We see the rise of freedom in Latin America where  one by one  dictatorships are giving way to democracy. We see it on the continent of Africa  where more and more nations see in the system of free enterprise salvation for economies crippled by excessive State control. East and West  North and South  on every continent  we can see the outlines of a new world of freedom.Of course  freedom's work remains unfinished. The trend we see is not yet universal. Some regimes still stand against the tide. Some rulers still deny the right of the people to govern themselves. But now the power of prejudice and despotism is challenged. Never before have these regimes stood so isolated and alone  so out of step with the steady advance of freedom. Today we are witnessing an ideological collapse  the demise of the totalitarian idea of the omniscient  all-powerful State. There are many reasons for this collapse  but in the end one fact alone explains what we see today: advocates of the totalitarian idea saw its triumph written in the laws of history  they failed to see the love of freedom that was written in the human heart.Two hundred years ago today  the United States - our Congress - proposed the Bill of Rights: fundamental freedoms belonging to every individual. Rights no Government can deny. Those same rights have been recognized in this congress of nations in the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. From where we stand  on the threshold of this new world of freedom  the trend is clear enough. If  for those who write the history of our times  the twentieth century is remembered as the century of the state  the twenty-first century must be an era of emancipation  the age of the individual. Make no mistake  nothing can stand in the way of freedom's march. There will come a day when freedom is seen the world over to be the universal birthright of every man and woman  of every race and walk of life. Even under the worst circumstances  at the darkest of times  freedom has always remained alive - a distant dream  perhaps  but always alive.Today  that dream is no longer distant. For the first time  for millions around the world  a new world of freedom is within reach. Today is freedom's moment. You see  the possibility now exists for the creation of a true community of nations  built on shared interests and ideals. A true community  a world where free Governments and free markets meet the rising desire of the people to control their own destiny  to live in dignity  and to exercise freely their fundamental human rights. It is time that worked together to deliver that destiny into the hands of men and women everywhere. Our challenge is to strengthen the foundations of freedom  encourage its advance and face our most urgent challenges  the global challenges of the twenty-first century: economic  health  environmental well-being  the great questions of war and peace.First  global economic growth. During this decade  a number of developing nations have moved into the ranks of the world's most advanced economies  all of them - each and every one - powered by the engine of free enterprise. In the decade ahead  others can join their ranks  but for many nations  barriers stand in the way. In the case of some countries  these are obstacles of their own making: un-needed restrictions  regulations that act as dead weights on their own economies and obstacles to foreign trade. But other barriers to growth exist  and those  too  require effective action.Too many developing countries struggle today under a burden of debt that makes growth all but impossible. The nations of the world deserve better opportunity to achieve a measure of control over their own economic fate and build better lives for their own people. The approach the United States has put forward - the Brady plan - will help these nations reduce that debt and  at the same time  encourage the free market reforms that will fuel economic growth.In just two days  I will be speaking to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  and I will discuss there  in more detail  the steps that our nations can take in dealing with the debt problem. But I can say now the new world of freedom is not a world where a few nations live in comfort while others live in want. The power of commerce is a force for progress. Open markets are the key to continued growth in the developing world. Today  the United States buys over one-half of the global manufactured exports that all developing nations combined sell to the industrialized world. It is time for the other advanced economies to follow suit  to create expanded opportunities for trade. I believe we will learn  in the century ahead  that many nations of the world have barely begun to tap their true potential for development. The free market and its fruits are not the special preserve of a few  they are a harvest that everyone can share.Beyond the challenge of global growth lies another issue of global magnitude: the environment. No line drawn on a map can stop the advance of pollution. Threats to our environment have become international problems. We must develop an international approach to urgent environmental issues  one that seeks common solutions to common problems. The United Nations is already at work on the question of global warming and the effort to prevent oil spills and other disasters from fouling our seas and the air we breathe. And I will tell you now the United States will do its part. We have committed ourselves to the world-wide phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000. We have proposed amending our own Clean Air Act to ensure clean air for our citizens within a single generation. We have banned the import of ivory to protect the elephant and rhinoceros from the human predators who exterminate them for profit. And we have begun to explore ways to work with other nations  with the major industrialized democracies  and in Poland and in Hungary  to make common cause for the sake of our environment.The environment belongs to all of us. In this new world of freedom  the world's citizens must enjoy this common trust for generations to come. Global economic growth and the stewardship of our planet - both are critical issues.But as always  questions of war and peace must be paramount to the United Nations. We must move forward to limit and eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Five years ago  at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva  I presented a United States draft treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Since then  progress has been made  but time is running out. The threat is growing. More than 20 nations now possess chemical weapons or the capability to produce them. And these horrible weapons are now finding their way into regional conflicts. That is simply unacceptable. For the sake of mankind  we must halt and reverse this threat.Today I want to announce steps that the United States is ready to take  steps to rid the world of these truly terrible weapons  steps towards a treaty that will ban - eliminate - all chemical weapons from the Earth 10 years from the day it is signed. This initiative contains three major elements. First  in the first eight years of a chemical weapons treaty the United States is ready to destroy nearly all - 98 per cent - of our chemical weapons stockpile  provided the Soviet Union joins the ban  and I think it will. Secondly  we are ready to destroy all of our chemical weapons - 100 per cent  every one - within 10 years  once all nations capable of building chemical weapons sign that total-ban treaty. And thirdly  the United States is ready to begin now. We will eliminate more than 80 per cent of our stockpile even as we work to complete a treaty  if the Soviet Union joins us in cutting chemical weapons to an equal level and if we agree on the conditions  including inspections  under which stockpiles are destroyed.We know that monitoring a total ban on chemical weapons will be a challenge. But the knowledge we have gained from our recent arms control experience and our accelerating research in this area makes me believe that we can achieve the level of verification that gives us confidence to go forward with the ban. The world has lived too long in the shadow of chemical warfare? so let us act together  beginning today  to rid the Earth of this scourge.We are serious about achieving conventional arms reductions as well. And that is why we put forward new proposals just last Thursday at the negotiations in Vienna on conventional forces in Europe  proposals that demonstrate our commitment to act rapidly to ease military tensions in Europe and move the nations of that continent one step closer to their common destiny: a Europe whole and free.The United States is convinced that open and innovative measures can move disarmament forward and also ease international tensions. That is the idea behind the ""open skies"" proposal  about which the Soviets have now expressed a positive attitude. It is the idea behind the ""open lands"" proposal  permitting for the first time ever free travel for all Soviet and United States diplomats throughout each other's countries. Openness is the enemy of mistrust  and every step towards a more open world is a step towards the new world we seek.Let me make this comment on our meetings with the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  Mr. Shevardnadze  over the past few days: I am very pleased by the progress made. The Soviet Union removed a number of obstacles to progress on conventional and strategic arms reductions. We reached agreements in principle on issues from verification to nuclear testing. And  of course  we agreed to a summit in the spring or early summer of 1990. I look forward to meeting Mr. Gorbachev there.Each of those achievements is important in its own right  but they are more important still as signs of a new attitude that prevails between the United States and the USSR. Serious differences remain; we know that. But the willingness to deal constructively and candidly with those differences is news that we and indeed the world must welcome. We have not entered into an era of perpetual peace. The threats to peace that nations face may today be changing  but they have not vanished. In fact  in a number of regions around the world  a dangerous combination is now emerging: regimes armed with old and unappeasable animosities and modern weapons of mass destruction. That development will raise the stakes whenever war breaks out. Regional conflict may well threaten world peace as never before.The challenge of preserving peace is a personal one for all individuals right here in this Hall. Mr. Secretary-General  I say with great respect that you have made it your own. The United Nations can be a mediator  a forum where parties in conflict come in search of peaceful solutions. For the sake of peace  the United Nations must redouble its support for the peace efforts now under way in regions of conflict all over the world. I assure the Assembly that the United States is determined to take an active role in settling regional conflicts. Sometimes our role in regional disputes is and will be highly public  and sometimes  like many others do  we work quietly behind the scenes. But always  we are working for positive change and lasting peace.Our world faces other  less conventional threats no less dangerous to international peace and stability. Illegal drugs are a menace to social order and a source of human misery wherever they gain a foothold. The nations which suffer this scourge must join forces in the fight  and we are. Let me salute the commitment and extraordinary courage of one country in particular: Colombia  wherewe are working with the people and their President  Virgil lo Barco  to put the drug cartels cut of business and bring the drug lords to justice.Finally  we must join forces to combat the threat of terrorism. Every nation and the United Nations must send the outlaws of the world a clear message hostage-taking and the terror of random violence are methods that cannot win the world's approval. Terrorism of any kind is repugnant to all values that a civilized world holds in common. And make no mistake.- Terrorism is a means that no end  no matter how just  can sanctify.Whatever the challenge  freedom greatly raises the chances of our success. Freedom's moment is a time for hope for all of the world  because freedom  once set in motion  takes on a momentum of its own. As I said the day I assumed the presidency of our country  we do not have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We know that free government  democracy  is best. And I believe that is the hard-won truth of our time  the unassailable fact that still stands at the end of a century of great struggle and human suffering. And this is true not because all our differences must give way to democracy   but because democracy makes room for all our differences. In democracy  diversity finds its common home.At the very heart of the democratic ideal is respect for freedom of belief  freedom of thought and action  in all its diversity  for human rights. The world has experienced enough of the ideologies that have promised to remake man in some new and better image. We have seen the colossal tragedies and dashed hopes. We know now that freedom and democracy hold the answers: what men and nations want is the freedom to live by their own lights and a chance to prosper  in peace.When I began today I spoke to you about peace-keeping. I want to speak to you now about peace-making. We must bring peace to the people who have never known its blessings. There is a painting that hangs on the wall of my office in the White House which pictures President Abraham Lincoln and his generals meeting near the end of a war that remains the bloodiest in the history of my country. Outside at that moment a battle rages  in this picture  and yet what we see in the distance is a rainbow  a symbol of hope  of the passing of the storm. That painting is called ""The Peace-makers"". For me  it is a constant reminder that our struggle  the struggle for peace  is a struggle blessed by hope.I do remember sitting in this Hall  I remember the mutual respect among all of us proudly serving as representatives  yes  I remember the almost endless speeches - and I do not want this to be one of them - the Security Council sessions  the receptions  those long receiving lines  the formal meetings of the General Assembly  and the informal discussions in the delegates' lounge. And I remember something more  something beyond the frantic pace and sometimes frustrating experiences of daily life here: The heartbeat of the United Nations  the quiet conviction that we could make the world more peaceful  more free. What we sought then  all of us  now lies within our reach. I ask each of you here in this Hall:Can we not bring a unity of purpose to the United Nations? Can we not make this new world of freedom the common destiny we seek? I believe we can. I know we must. My solemn wish today is that here  among the United Nations  that spirit will take hold  and that all men and all nations will make freedom's moment their own.Thank you  God bless you  and may God bless the work of the United Nations.

"145",7310,"VCT",44,1989,"ï»¿The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines wishes to offer Mr. Joseph Garba its sincere congratulations on his election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. We look forward eagerly to playing our part to ensure the success of the session under his experienced leadership.The historic forty-third session is still fresh in our minds  and we would be found wanting if we failed to pay a tribute to the former President  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the efficient manner in which he presided over the forty-third session of the Assembly  thus ensuring its successful conclusion.My delegation wishes to congratulate the Secretary-General for his enlightening and comprehensive report on the work of the organization and for his initiatives during the past year in pursuit of peace and security.There is a wind of change blowing in international politics. We witness a trend in international relations in which confrontation is being replaced by co-operation  and bitter cold-war rivalries of the past by consensus and mutual accommodation. The present mood to a large extent reflects the easing of East-West tension and greater co-operation between the major Powers. The international community welcomes the progress made by the United States and the Soviet Union in negotiations aimed at reducing by half their stockpile of strategic weapons. The prospects for a comprehensive and verifiable treaty banning chemical weapons  which has been proposed by both super-Powers  is also very exciting.The eyes of the world are upon us at this time. The General Assembly at this session will earn the respect of the present as well as future generations  if  through its deliberations and decisions  it can sustain the present trend and widen the current detente to ensure peace and progress for all mankind. The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines applauds the people of Poland for their historic decision to enhance democracy and move to an open-market economy.The positive developments in the Soviet Union  Hungary and East Europe  inspired by General Secretary Gorbachev  hold tremendous lessons for the third world on the evolution of political theory.The cordial atmosphere of international politics today presents an opportunity which should not be missed for resolving those intractable regional conflicts which for so long have destabilized the world community.In Afghanistan  in spite of the 1988 Geneva Agreements and the withdrawal of Soviet troops  the war continues unabated. The delegation of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines supports the Secretary-General in the efforts he is making to facilitate a settlement. We look forward to a return to normalcy in that country torn by civil war  and to the early return to their homeland of the millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran.The fragile cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and the direct talks between the two sides have yielded no conclusive results. We urge the Governments of the two countries to co-operate with the Secretary-General's efforts to transform the present cease-fire into a lasting peace based on Security Council resolution 598 (1987). While the Paris Conference on Cambodia held in August did not yield a comprehensive solution to the problem  it was nevertheless a commendable step towards achieving the conditions necessary for the Cambodian people to freely exercise their right to self-determination.We also applaud the diplomatic and other initiatives of fee Association of South-East Asian Nations and hope that all other interested parties will join in the search for a durable peace in Cambodia.The problem of the two Koreas still remains unresolved. It appears that efforts to establish a machinery for dialogue and peace have made no substantial progress. It is fee firm belief of my delegation that the admission of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations would not only be in conformity with the principle of universality  but would help to create a better political environment for a peaceful solution of the Korean question.My delegation looks forward with enthusiasm to the implementation of the Secretary-General's peace plan for Western Sahara. We hope feat there can be an early referendum on self-determination. We urge continued dialogue between the POLISARIO and fee Kingdom of Morocco and a continued search for a settlement of this issue within the framework of the proposals of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.While encouraging signs have emerged on the political horizon in many parts of the world  there are some intractable problems which defy our best efforts to find solutions.The oppressed majority of South Africans are still struggling to achieve their freedom and self-determination. My delegation reiterates its call for the intensification of sanctions and other forms of pressure by the international community on South Africa for the eliminating of the inhuman system of apartheid and for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners.  The end of Namibia's long road to independence is in sight. The withdrawal of South African forces and the demobilization and disarming of territorial forces were' carried out on scheme  the draft electoral law is under careful examination before final assent is given  political detainees have been released by both Parties to the conflict; some 83 per cent of estimated eligible Namibians have demonstrated their commitment to the electoral process by registering to vote a month before the deadline  and many thousands of refugees  some in exile for a whole generation  have returned to their homeland. These are all positive steps leading to the eventual independence of Namibia. We join those who have paid a tribute to the Secretary-General  his Special Representative and Deputy  and the many United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) military police and civilian personnel for their dedication and personal commitment to Namibia's freedom.Saint Vincent and the Grenadines fully supports the United Nations plan for implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978) and calls on all parties not to impede the movement towards peace. My country looks forward to the day when the Namibian people  who have waited so long for the opportunity to determine their future  take their seat as the newest Member of this Organization. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is concerned that recent efforts to bring about a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict have not yielded any positive results. My country will support any initiative which is aimed at securing a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). There is today growing support for a properly structured conference based on Israel's right to exist and recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinians. We support that proposal.The bloody civil war drags on endlessly in Lebanon. My delegation supports all initiatives  including those of the Arab League  for stabilizing the situation in that strife-torn country. All the parties to the conflict should move towards securing an effective cease-fire and initiating the process of national reconciliation leading to the full exercise of Lebanese sovereignty. All external pressures in Lebanon should be removed in order that the Lebanese parties might agree on some viable system of peaceful coexistence.Last year this body paid a glowing tribute to all those serving and those who have served in the United Nations peace-keeping forces on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for""their achievement and their contribution to the United Nations peace-keeping operations and  by extension to world peace and security"". Today  we lament and deplore the tragic  cold-blooded murder of Lt. Colonel William R. Higgins  a United States citizen  while serving in the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Lebanon. We call on those organizations or groups which are at present holding foreign hostages to release then and thus end their suffering and that of their relatives and friends. We also urge those countries with influence over the hostage-takers to assist in arresting this crime against humanity and to help to bring all the foreign hostages home from Lebanon.Turning to my own region  Latin America and the Caribbean  my delegation welcomes the very positive developments in Central America. We commend the five Central American Governments for their determined efforts to restore peace and stability to the region and call on the international community to do all in its power further to advance the peace process.My country welcomes the ratification of the Cartagena Protocol which opens the way foe accession of the Caribbean nations of Belize and Guyana to the Organization of American States.We also note with satisfaction the progress being made in the Republic of Chile for the full restoration of its democratic institutions.The eastern Caribbean  particularly Antigua and Barbuda  the British Virgin Islands  Dominica  Montserrat and Saint Kitts and Nevis recently experienced the full force of hurricane Hugo  which left death and considerable damage to housing  infrastructure and agriculture in its wake. The road to recovery will be long and costly and we hope that the international community will move swiftly to assist in the rehabilitation efforts.While being encouraged by all the positive developments in the international community  my Government feels  however  that insufficient progress was registered during the past year in resolving various existing non-military threats to global peace and security. These threats include persistent poverty in many parts of the world  lack of economic growth and development  large-scale unemployment  injustice and inequalities between nations and severe environmental degradation. These problems tend to be global in scope and require the concerted efforts of the international community to find solutions to them.The fruits of science and technology are very unevenly distributed internationally and in the current North-South frame of analysis  the developing countries of the South find themselves falling further behind in the race for development and progress. The external debt crisis continues to impede growth in developing countries and this situation is aggravated by fundamental imbalances in the international monetary system.Protectionism is on the increase and the terms of trade for the primary-producing  countries still work against them in the current unfavourable international market situation. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines welcomes the convening of the special session of the General assembly devoted to international co-operation  the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  and the preparation of the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade - all of which will be held within the coming year. We hope that these conferences will lead to a clearer understanding of the present problems in the areas of trade  external debt and development.The international community should be constantly reminded of the problems of small island developing States  in which category Saint Vincent and the Grenadines falls. These States are characterized by narrow economic bases  limited internal markets  diseconomies of scale  and lack of opportunities to take advantage of external markets. There is a further disadvantage in that many of these States - like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines - are archipelagic  a phenomenon which poses seriou3 problems with consequential economic and social cost. Their small size also makes such States run the risk of being overlooked in international economic and financial decision-making. It is important that adequate resources be made available to them on appropriate terms for national development.The population explosion of our time and over-exploitation of the natural resources of our planet due to poverty and rapid economic expansion have resulted in a number of environmental problems which put at risk the entire human race. The issues of toxic waste  deforestation  desertification  acid rain  the widening gap in the ozone layer  erratic climatic changes and the greenhouse effect are global in scope and must be dealt with by the entire international community working together. Swift and workable solutions must be found if mankind is to preserve the environment for coming generations.Other problems in society  such as the international flow of refugees  the status of women and children  and the international scourge of drugs continue to require the urgent attention of the international community.The Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines recognizes the grave danger that international drug trafficking and drug abuse pose to all countries. That scourge transcends national borders and it is imperative that international co-operation be increased and intensified to eradicate it from the face of the globe. To that end  my delegation gives unqualified support to the proposal of Trinidad and Tobago for the establishment of an international criminal court to investigate and adjudicate the criminal responsibilities of persons engaged in drug trafficking  and to the initiative of Jamaica for the establishment of a United Nations multilateral  multisectoral force that would provide assistance to States  on their request  in the areas of intelligence and interdiction.The next decade will perhaps be the most challenging ever faced by human society. Advances in science and technology have put into our hands the means of achieving unlimited progress. Current developments in nuclear technology  space travel  oceanography and biotechnology will profoundly affect our lives in the future. But the same technology can be the means of annihilating the human race. Some of the fundamental issues facing the world today have to do with life and death and survival. As we examine these issues during the remainder of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will work with all other nations in the interest of world peace  security and prosperity.

"146",7357,"VEN",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  it is a great pleasure for me to extend to you the greetings and congratulations of Venezuela's people and Government on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at this session. My congratulations go also to the other members of the Bureau. At the same time  we address words of thanks to the outgoing President  Mr. Dante Caputo  for the extraordinary manner in which he carried out his tasks at the last session  as well as to the Secretary-General  Javier Perez de Cuellar  for the excellent work he has done.In the last decade of the twentieth century  we must pause to reflect on the history and experience of this century. Today we can begin to assess what these last 10 years of our century will be and should be. The super-Powers have entered into a period of detente  accommodation and co-operation  with vital initiatives  particularly with regard to nuclear and conventional disarmament  and a determination to solve and not to interfere in regional conflicts that have brought so much human and material harm to the countries of the third world.This irrational period of the cold war has also left behind a tragic situation   the world's economy and a crisis from which the great power cannot escape  because no economy can finance unlimited military spending. We have all paid for this  but most especially the countries of the third world. 	It would seem  that we can at long last discern a willingness by the international society to tolerate its own diversity and to act jointly to reduce and whenever possible remove sources of tension and convicts we had virtually grown accustomed to living with. I wish to express Venezuela's appreciation of the initiatives of detente and disarmament undertaken by the super-Powers  and express to their leaders our confidence in their determination and perseverance. If the major blocs manage to arrive at concerted action  we shall at long last begin to overcome the cold war and the threat of nuclear warfare.Thirteen years ago on 16 November 1976  I came to this rostrum as President of Venezuela. On that occasion I said that the global political balance ostensibly rested on peaceful coexistence - peaceful coexistence which by its very name only meant a longer or shorter truce. I defined the separation  the dismembering  of world into antagonistic blocs  for interdependence to achieve equality and co-operation among equals had not prevailed in the relations between powerful countries and between the  powerful and the weaker countries. I then proposed  as I do today  the establishment of a new international economic order  for  otherwise  the world's political balance will continue to be in serious jeopardy. As I recall those words  I must acknowledge with deep concern  now that the sovereign will of my people has brought me once again to the presidency that  tragically  the call I then made to the conscience of the developed countries remains timely. Throughout all these years the developed countries' relations with the weaker  developing nations have deteriorated. Not only has trade between North and South become even more unfair than it was 13 years ago  but the situation has worsened substantially through the decade now ending  with the unbearable problem of debt.As regards this crisis that undermines the stability of the debtor countries  no one can claim that there have not been enough warnings or that successive formulas for its solution have not been presented. Venezuela has always been willing to explore such formulas. It is not acceptable that debtor countries should continue to finance the growth of industrialized nations through net transfers of resources. It is essential to reverse this trend so that the developing countries may be able to finance their own sustained growth and their peoples' well-being.Initiatives aimed at reducing both the amount of debt and the cost of servicing - particularly those embodied in the so-called Brady plan - are positive steps that confirm the political nature of the crisis and the principle of co-responsibility for its solution. However  the contributions offered by creditor nations and by international commercial banks remain insufficient - to say the least.The efforts we can all make to solve the debt problem cannot be divorced from the general evolution of relations between the third world and the industrialized countries. The gravity of the situation  so often pointed to  lies in the fact that the existing economic relations between North and South have compromised  and continue to compromise  our possibilities for development. It is clear to all that  without sustained economic growth  the essential investment in social and political areas is impossible.The alarming aspect of this situation is that  as yet  there is no clear vision or awareness in the developed countries of what is really at stake. What could be more brittle or unpredictable than societies that have no hope and no confidence? It is claimed that harsh economic adjustments will be sufficient. Indeed  Venezuela believes those to be necessary  but without a solution to the debt problem  without broader external support  those adjustments are not feasible  and the political stability of our countries  and even the world's political balance  are endangered.Ultimately  crises are brought about by failure to interpret objectively existing risk indicators and by lack of willingness to commit the necessary ideas and resources to prevent them. The debt crisis requires the same long-range vision as was applied to Japan and Europe after the war. What is at stake is the destiny of mankind. Almost one third of the world's population is unable to achieve a solution to the problem of economic growth as a prerequisite to the possibility of servicing the debt. The danger of a social explosion embracing over 1 billion human beings will not be avoided  and the consequences of that explosion will be felt in the industrialized nations  which look with unprecedented coldness upon the rapid deterioration of the situation*This year Venezuela has become a full member of the Non-Aligned Movement. In so doing  we have joined the great community of third world countries  which recognize non-alignment as the choice most consonant with our reality and aspirations  and which trust in the strength of unity to give our positions the weight they need to promote changes in contemporary politics and economics.Venezuela has always placed special emphasis on the importance of relations between developing countries. We are convinced that we  the countries of the third world  will never be able to exercise fully our political sovereignty  or to achieve equity in our economic relations with developed countries  unless we substantially enhance South-South relations  as an indispensable premise for strengthening our bargaining capacity. International society need not be condemned permanently to be governed by the patterns of the past. That is clear from what is happening today in East-West relations and from the efforts of European countries to assert their identity and explore new avenues. The international system must evolve and reflect today's pluralism. It is our aim to ensure that developing countries - our culture  our economies and our political realities - are fully incorporated into a multipolar world. It is with this vision  which transcends conflicts and highlights affinities and common potential  that we strive to equip ourselves with the institutions we need to be able to speak out and to act more effectively.Venezuela  like other developing countries  is aware of the need to work towards revitalizing the North-South dialogue. In this regard Venezuela stated its position at the forty-third session of the General Assembly. It reiterated that position at the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting of the Group of 77  held in Caracas in June  in the Paris initiative  taken by the Presidents of Egypt  Senegal and Venezuela and by the Prime Minister of India during their meeting on the occasion of the bicentennial of the French Revolution; and  more recently  at the meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  where it was firmly supported by all the Movement's members  and a group of 15 countries  representing Africa  Asia  Latin America and Europe  was established. That group will hold annual meetings  at the level of Heads of State or Government  to discuss issues of interest to the countries that make up the South.Latin America  despite the changes it has gone through  is not immune to political difficulties. Allow me to mention in particular the evolution of the Central American situation. The latest developments  as illustrated by the Tela agreements  in Honduras  confirm that  with autonomy  with confidence and with international support  the Central American countries will be able to achieve peace. We also welcome the agreement reached by El Salvador with the leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front on a suspension of hostilities and the beginning of negotiations with the Government of El Salvador which would enable those leaders to become involved in the political and democratic process of that country.Few cases have better illustrated than those in Latin America the harm caused by foreign interference  based on false premises of strategic interest.Elsewhere in Central America we are watching with concern developments in Panama. The abrogation of its democratic process  apart from denying the sovereign right of the Panamanian people to choose its own Government  is a factor destabilizing the vigorous process of democratisation in Latin America. Nothing would be more unacceptable to us than a crisis that would call into question the Torrerijos-Carter Treaties  which we consider to be an accomplishment of Latin American solidarity and a commitment uniting all our peoples.Those of us who  like Venezuela  have a direct responsibility in this historical   claim   of Latin America  cannot view with indifference the build-up of elements of tension. Nothing can be more important for Latin America than to have the Panamanian community democratically settle its disagreements and to see the provisions of the Canal Treaties complied with to the letter. I wish to say how pleased we Venezuelans are to see the beginning of a process that will lead to self-determination for the Puerto Rican people. We are linked to Puerto Rico by strong ties of history and culture. However  only the people of Puerto Rico can decide its future. This year there have been new developments  and Venezuela trusts that they will soon make it possible for the preferences of the people of Puerto Rico to be made known in a free expression of sovereign will. We cannot conceal the fact that we Latin Americans wish to see Puerto Rico become another Latin nation  like those our liberators dreamed of and fought for. In those cases  which I have mentioned  because of their importance for Venezuela and for Latin America as a whole  a fundamental role is played by the United States of America. Venezuela hopes that friendly country will continue its present course of favouring multilateral dialogue and continued consultations. We are convinced that that is the only way for the American continent to advance towards the achievement of those values to which we all subscribe  both within the inter-American system and within the United Nations system.Venezuela strives for close relations and co-operation in its foreign policy. We still have difficult historical obstacles to overcome. One is the reconciliation of our Latin American  continental and Caribbean identities. We had been separated from the Caribbean by colonialism and its divisive sequels. Today we can applaud the great advances the nations of the Caribbean have made in fostering their own identity and their admirable efforts at rapprochement with the rest of our region. Those countries not only are our neighbours and friends  but are also an inextricable part of Latin America with which we share opportunities and hopes in a common future.To conclude the presentation of our views on Latin American affairs  I shall refer briefly to the Group of Eight. This year there will be held in Lima  Peru  the third presidential meeting of the permanent mechanism for political consultation and co-ordination. This mechanism has transformed the scope of our relations in Latin America and our approach to them.Venezuela reiterates its rejection of colonialism and all forms of racial discrimination. We share the deep concern of the other Members of the United Nations  particularly the countries of southern Africa  over the persistence of the genocidal system of apartheid  which is a Nazi-style violation of human rights  a crime against humanity. We welcome with great satisfaction the holding of a special session of the General Assembly on apartheid.I turn to the subject of decolonisation. We have consistently supported initiatives aimed at removing the last vestiges of colonialism  particularly those relating to the independence of Namibia and the implementation of the Security Council's plan for that purpose. We trust that the countries directly involved in solving the problem will continue to show the necessary political will to bring the process to a successful conclusion with the holding of the elections scheduled for November  under United Nations supervision.We are watching with hope developments with regard to the problem of Western Sahara. We support the initiatives of the Secretary-General and reaffirm our conviction that direct dialogue will contribute effectively to recognition of the rights of the Sahraoui people  the resolution of the conflict and the process of integration in the Mahgreb.We Latin Americans must include in this survey the case of the Malvinas. We trust that the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom  in keeping with resolutions of the United Nations and international law and solidarity  will initiate talks aimed at settling the controversy concerning sovereignty over those islands in the South Atlantic  which have formed part of the Argentine Republic since we Latin American peoples became independent from Spain.I cannot fail to mention the dreadful tragedy of Lebanon  a land torn by a suicidal and diabolical conflict. The Lebanese people deserve the support and protection of the world. We commend the decision of the Arab League to set up a commission made up of the sovereigns of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and the President of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria to mediate in that horrible and absurd conflict. Venezuela appeals to the United Nations to show the greatest diligence in bringing about an end to the terrible massacres and violations of human rights  and we shall co-operate in any initiative in which we can play a useful part.In view of their paramount importance for the life of our societies and for international security  I shall now touch upon the problems of drugs and the environment. In 1984 Venezuela put forward a draft convention (resolution 39/141  annex) concerning the struggle against illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances. We are happy to see today ever-growing support for that draft convention.At the non-aligned Summit  Venezuela  together with other Latin American countries  recently proposed other initiatives with regard to the prevention of and action against the laundering of money proceeding from drug trafficking. A systematic effort is being made in our countries and at a sub regional Andean level to eradicate that evil.This year  the gravity and extent of that crime against humanity have been highlighted by the current events in Colombia. International solidarity has remained more a matter of words than of deeds. Let us look  for example  at the behaviour of the United States. Undoubtedly  that country came to the fore in offering solidarity and material aid  but instead of such circumstantial aid  would it not have been more important to strengthen the Colombian economy by supporting the International Coffee Agreement?But that was not the case. Besieged by drug-trafficking dollars  the coffee-growing countries  Colombia and other indebted countries such as Brazil amongst them  have seen their resources dwindle as a result of the United States' refusal to subscribe to the agreements of the International Coffee Organization. Prices have plummeted. How can we fight drug-trafficking in those circumstances  with such low prices for our commodities and such heavy debts?Nevertheless  we welcome the agreement reached at the Paris Summit. We are convinced that little can be achieved without forceful action upon demand. It is up to the producer countries to fight the trafficking  but the consumer countries must also drastically curb their demand  since that is what makes the struggle against drug-trafficking so much more difficult. The fight against drug-trafficking must be relentless and forceful. Let us not forget that  besides the erosion of our institutions and its impact upon health  drug trafficking and consumption are linked to terrorism  clandestine arms trafficking  the revival of mercenary activities  and the violation of human rights.I must say that despite all that 1 have stated in a spirit of optimism  the fight against drugs must be the subject of international legislation sponsored by the United Nations in a world conference that will confront this crime which knows no frontiers and which uses them only to evade and trample upon our sovereignty and well-being.At the Ninth Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries in Belgrade  I proposed the convening of a world conference to discuss an international convention against drug-trafficking that would be binding on all countries of the world.As to the environment  allow me to reiterate what I have said in other forums. Development and the environment are interrelated. Until now  they have been inimical. It is necessary for developed and developing countries to approach the problem jointly and to reconcile our perspectives in a united effort that will enable us to preserve our environmental heritage without detriment to our common right to development.I wish to propose that the Members of the United Nations formulate a convention that will commit all of us. My country belongs to an essential region of the world  the immense Amazonia. The eight nations making up that region have established the Amazonian Pact whereby  without relinquishing our sovereignty  we have sought to ensure its conservation as a patrimony of mankind and as a legacy of nature to the development and wealth of our nations.Venezuela fully supports the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalization of the economic growth and development of developing countries to be held in April 1990. We shall be present at that important event. We also wish to express our great interest in seeing the successful completion of the preliminary work being done on the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade.Let us dedicate the next decade of the twentieth century to the preservation of children  the future of mankind in the third millennium of our world. Let us set about reducing by half the death rate of children as well as of mothers. Let us strive for a universal primary school education and the elimination of severe malnutrition.In this forum of mankind  I should like to invite you all to subscribe to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child  which represents the consensus of all the Governments of the world as to the minimum guarantees that every society must offer to its children. That must become the new international ethic. Venezuela will support in the Assembly this agreement aimed at safeguarding the most extensively violated rights of the world - the rights of children. We shall also support the holding of a world summit devoted to childhood  as proposed by the United Nations Children's Fund. To the Prime Minister of Sweden  who was the first to support that summit  we offer our full co-operation in sponsoring it  together with the other nations wishing to join that initiative.In April of this year  at the 12th meeting of Ministers of Health of the Andean Countries in Caracas  I suggested the convening of a Latin American regional summit. Our regional statistics are truly alarming. One million children under the age of five die every years 360 000 in Brazil  175 000 in Mexico  245 000 in the Andean countries. Every Latin American child is born with an external debt of $32 000 and a social debt of $23 000. Every newborn child receives a historical liability of 360 000  equivalent to more than 25 time3 our nations' gross domestic product per capita. In sum  in Latin America most of the children are poor and most of the poor are children.Human eclipse or social development! that is the choice facing mankind on the eve of the third millennium.We have come to the United Nations to advocate international co-operation. Let us not close our eyes to the countless dangers that we face at this promising moment. Let us take note of the dangers and work together to further the prevalence of reason. The economic and social problems our peoples face are immense  and we have no right to postpone solutions or open the door to conflict and instability. Strategic confrontation dominated the best minds of this past century. Perhaps it is now time to turn our eyes upon ourselves  upon our peoples and our societies  to assess their condition  their moral wants  their crises  and attempt to find solutions. 		This will make us realize how mistaken we have been this last  turbulent half of the twentieth century  and will open a gateway of hope so that  as we approach this magical date of the third millennium  we may be confident that in the new century all nations of the world will be able to march forward together in a spirit  of solidarity  with a single aims to ensure the well being of all mankind."
"147",7396,"VNM",44,1989,"ï»¿The delegation of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam wishes to extend to the President its congratulations upon his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. I am confident that his guidance will help ensure the Assembly's success in the discharge of its high mission.I should also like to express our appreciation to Mr. Dante Caputo  President of the forty-third session of the General Assembly  for his contribution to the successful work of the last session. Let me convey my delegation's special appreciation of the efforts ma de by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Javier PÃ©rez de Cuellar  towards maintaining peace and solving regional conflicts in many parts of the world during the past year.Since the forty-third session of the General Assembly we have been witnessing profound changes in international relations  the driving force behind which has been the unprecedented advances of the scientific and technological revolution  together with the dynamic struggle of Â· peoples throughout the world for peace  national independence and socialism over the last 40 years.Today  all peoples share a common desire for peace  stability and the promotion of international co-operation for the sake of development. The human race has awakened to the danger of the scourge of nuclear war and is constantly on the alert in the face of the readiness of certain ruling circles to continue the arms race. While these circles are continually paying lip-service to peace and disarmament  their arsenals of weapons of mass destruction remain as huge as ever  their annual military budgets have not been reduced in the least  and they continue to set up more military bases abroad. Therefore - the prevention and elimination of the threat of nuclear war  and the defence of world peace  remain a primordial task of the international community  aid an arduous battle.We offer our strong support for the constructive proposals of the States parties to the Warsaw Treaty on the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. We warmly welcome the positive initiatives of the Soviet Union with regard to conventional armed forces  a comprehensive ban on all nuclear explosions  end chemical weapons that were put forward by President Gorbachev last December at the forty-third session of the General Assembly aid by Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in the general debate at the current session. We share the views of almost all Member States regarding the imperative need to conclude  at an early date  a convention on the strict prohibition of all chemical weapons.The political documents concerning international security aid disarmament of the Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries recently held in Belgrade  Yugoslavia  and the Six-Nation Initiative developed in the five years since May 1984 have generated a positive momentum in the struggle for peace and disarmament.Undoubtedly  the forces of peace have prevailed over those of war  but the path leading to a world free of nuclear weapons and violence in international relations is still fraught with trials and hardships. At present  we are witnessing attempts to redraw the political nap of the world through ""peaceful subversion""  and thus to bring about the collapse of socialism from within. This is only an illusion. In the course of the past few decades  the road towards socialism has been opted for by more than one third of mankind. The new social system is making its positive impact strongly felt. The contribution of socialism lies in the mainstream of the changes in today's world. Temporary difficulties notwithstanding  the forces of socialism will continue their rightful course aid are certain to overcome every obstacle and gather greater strength to make a major contribution to human development.Another equally serious threat that continues to cause concern to all is the economic aid social situation of developing countries. The objectives and targets of the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade (1981-1990) have not been implemented. Production has stagnated  per capita income has declined  unemployment and hunger have affected hundreds of millions of people  external debt has exceeded $US 1.3 trillion and the outflow of financial resources from developing to developed countries has reached more than 330 billion a year. There are nearly one billion illiterates.The gap in the levels of economic  scientific and technological development as well as in living standards between developing and developed countries is increasingly widening. These countries are in danger of being left far behind in poverty and backwardness  the inevitable result of which will be an extremely negative impact on the world economic situation and on international economic relations.To avoid that situation what is of paramount importance is to establish a new international economic order  and in which international economic relations would be based on real equity  equality and democracy. An immediate and unconditional end should be put to acts of economic blockade aid embargo  to the use of economic assistance as an instrument for exerting political pressure  to the shifting of the burden of economic adjustment onto the shoulders of developing countries  taking advantage of capital and technology to maintain the domination and exploitation of developing countries. Developing countries should be completely free to choose their economic and social system without foreign interference or pressure. The resumption of North-South negotiations is a legitimate and urgent demand. The decision to convene a special session of the General Assembly in April 1990 devoted to international economic co-operation  in particular to the revitalization of economic growth and development of developing countries as well as the adoption in 1990 of the international development strategy for the fourth United Nations development decade  1991-2000  ate important initiatives of developing countries. These events will provide a good opportunity for all nations  especially developed market-economy countries  to work together to find an effective solution to economic and social difficulties facing developing countries and at the same time to cope with intractable global problems of the world economy and of international economic relations.The demand for strengthening international co-operation to protect the environment is urgent  fundamental and of long standing. We hope that the second world conference on the environment and development  to be held not later than 1992  will come up with the adoption of a code of conduct for the protection and preservation of the environment for the common interest of the international community We also fully support all efforts of the international community to fight illicit drug trafficking aid drug abuse  which are spreading throughout the world.We have been witnessing the unfolding of the arduous and complex process of seeking political solutions to the many regional conflicts that have dragged on for decades.In Namibia  with the signing of the agreements on South West Africa  the granting of independence to Namibia  in accordance with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  has made a start  albeit not an easy one. We hope that soon the international community will be able to welcome an independent and sovereign Namibia. Ho this end it is required that all parties concerned  the South African regime in particular  abide fully and strictly by resolution 435 (1978) aid the agreements reached  ensuring the necessary conditions for a free and fair election in the Territory.We welcome the efforts made and the agreements achieved by the countries of Central America with a view to restoring peace and stability in the region. Those agreements must be observed  free from outside interference. Viet Nam further reaffirms its most vigorous support for  and solidarity with  socialist Cuba. We also extend our support to the peoples of Nicaragua and Panama  particularly at this juncture  in their struggle to defend their independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity against external interference. We support the position of the People's Democratic Republic of Korea towards the peaceful reunification of Korea.The good will shown by the Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union and their scrupulous implementation of the Geneva Agreements on Afghanistan must be duly matched. The other parties concerned must likewise implement those agreements strictly.Our strong support goes to the just struggle of the Palestinian people. The constructive position adapted by the State of Palestine has facilitated the search for a political solution to the question of Palestine. We stand for the convening of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of all patties concerned and of the State of Palestine on an equal footing.For over a year there have been positive developments in the search for a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian question  especially after the State of Cambodia and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  with the concurrence of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  issued their statement of 5 April 1989 announcing the completion of the total withdrawal of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Cambodia by the end of September 1989. Abiding strictly by its commitment  Viet Nam successfully completed the last withdrawal between 21 and 26 September last  witnessed by over 100 observers from 20 countries  6 international organizations and over 400 foreign journalists. The heroic sons of the Vietnamese nation have discharged their sacred mission and returned home. International opinion has recognized this fact of decisive significance. I am most heartened by the objective assessment of Viet Nam's good will by many delegations in this forum. From this rostrum I solemnly declare that as of 27 September 1989 there does not remain a single volunteer Vietnamese soldier in Cambodia - either army man  adviser or military employee. The arguments put forth by a minority with a view to distorting that reality are used only as an attempt to justify continuation of the war so as to restore the genocidal regime or to interfere in the internal affairs of the Cambodian people.The total withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia is an important and fundamental contribution on the peaceful settlement of the Cambodian question. It resolves one of the two key issues of a comprehensive political solution  as was determined by the Djakarta Informal Meetings. The task that now poses itself is to continue resolving the second key issue that is interlinked with the troop withdrawal and is an indispensable requisite if a comprehensive settlement is truly to be achieved. The second key issue is the need to prevent the genocidal Pol Pot clique from kindling civil war and re-establishing its genocidal rule in Cambodia. It is both a fundamental political issue and an imperative demand of the Cambodian people  former victims of the scourge of Pol Pot's genocide  as well as of the human conscience  which does not want the nightmare of the killing fields ever to repeat itself  especially in view of the fact that the fortieth anniversary of the Convention on the Prevention aid Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was commemorated not long ago. lb this end  the countries concerned need scrupulously to honour their own commitments  terminating all military aid to all the Cambodian parties and refraining from any act that may encourage civil war and from interfering in the internal affairs of Cambodia. This will be a test of their goodwill  of whether they really wish to help secure lasting peace and national reconciliation for Cambodia.On the basis of the dialogue between the two sides in Cambodia and of the conclusions of the First and Second Jakarta Informal Meetings  the International Conference on Cambodia was held from 30 July to 30 August last in Paris  under the presidency of two co-presidents  France and Indonesia. Although there remain a few substantial outstanding differences  the Paris Conference has agreed on many important issues and thus laid the ground for an early comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian question. It is generally accepted that the momentum generated by the Paris Conference should be kept up and its initial results be built upon further  if durable peace and stability in Cambodia as well as in South-East Asia as a whole is to be restored soon. This would be in the spirit of the communiquÃ© issued on 27 September by the French and Indonesian co-presidents.The Ninth Summit Meeting of Non-Aligned Countries  held in Belgrade from 4 to 7 September last  once again demonstrated the Non-Aligned Movement's judicious approach to the question of South-East Asia end Cambodia. We highly appreciate the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations himself to induce the countries concerned and the Cambodian parties to engage in negotiations. In the face of the new developments in the situation of Cambodia and South-East Asia  the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session ought to adopt an objective approach and refrain from siding with one side against the other  which can lead only to the impasse of the last 10 years. Those actions that in fact jeopardize the role which should be played by the United Nations ought not to be repeated. At the present juncture  our common expectation is to see this important world body manifest its equity and impartiality.The international community's present concern is the need to adopt urgent and effective measures to prevent the danger of a civil war initiated by the genocidal Pol Pot clique and other Khmer opposition parties. On 23 September last the Prime Minister of Thailand put forward an initiative calling for a ceasefire between the Cambodian patties and for the convening of an informal meeting on Cambodia. Viet Nam supports the efforts of the Thai Prime Minister aimed at promoting a ceasefire  preventing civil war after the total withdrawal of the Vietnamese troops  curtailing military aid to the Cambodian parties and preventing the re-establishment of the genocidal regime in Cambodia.Viet Nam supports the position of the State of Cambodia that in the transitional period from the total Vietnamese withdrawal to the general elections the political and military status quo should be maintained in Cambodia and an on-the-spot ceasefire observed between the two opposing Cambodian forces. Only the Cambodian people can  through internationally controlled free and democratic general elections  modify this status quo and choose their political regime according to their own wish.  We hold the view that foreign countries should respect Cambodia's independence and neutrality and refrain from interfering in its internal affairs. We support turning South-East Asia into a zone of peace  freedom aid neutrality  following the principles advanced by the Lao people's Democratic Republic.As we stand on the threshold of the twenty-first century  the tireless struggle for peace  national independence  development and social progress is bound to be successfully carried forward  thus enabling future generations to enjoy lasting peace and rise to new heights of human civilization.Working for our children's future and our future generations' education: such was the greatest goal of the whole life of President Ho Chi Min  whose centenary as a Vietnamese hero of national liberation aid a great man of culture will be celebrated by the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the world in 1990  as decided by the General Assembly of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization. We take this opportunity to convey our support for the convention on the rights of the child and for the convening of the forthcoming summit conference on children and the world conference on education.True to the ideals of President Ho Chi Minh  the Vietnamese people pledge to do their utmost to strengthen their solidarity and friendship with other nations of the world  contribute to the victory of the forces of peace aid socialism aid turn to the new millennium with a firm belief in a bright future of peace  development and a happy life on our planet."
"148",7430,"VUT",44,1989,"ï»¿Mr. President  ascending the steps which lead to this podium# and speaking before the United Nations General Assembly is always a great honour and privilege. Today this honour and privilege take on added significance for our delegation. I have the pleasure of conveying to you  and to the Government and people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria# congratulations and best wishes on your unanimous election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly.Furthermore# I have the honour of conveying to you a personal congratulatory message from Father Halter Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu. The Prime Minister: sends his fondest regards to you  a friend and a man he knows to be not only a proud son of Nigeria  but also a proud son of Vanuatu. We recall that the honorary title of  Chief  was bestowed upon you at a custom ceremony during a visit you made to Vanuatu in 1985  in your capacity as Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid. Thus Nigeria's pride and joy on your election is shared by Vanuatu. I will resist  for the sake of life  repeating the many words already spoken In praise of your diplomatic experience and skills. Instead  I will merely associate out delegation and myself with those words and the sentiments they express. We prefer to draw attention to four words  which those of us are privileged to know you personally find most appropriate in describing you. Those four words are: sincerity  courage  dignity  and integrity. Those four qualities make you not only a proud son of your country and of Africa  but also of all those who cherish those virtues.We join in the tribute paid to the Group of African States  particularly to the Governments of Cameroon and Egypt  by the Minister of External Affairs of Nigeria  when he addressed the General Assembly and expressed gratitude for the African consensus which led to your election. Furthermore  we associate ourselves with the very moving words of appreciation we have heard you address to our dear friend and brother  Mr. Paul Bamela Hugo  the Permanent Representative of Cameroon  What you expressed on that occasion  Mr. President - with which we concur - were fat more than the usual sentiments.We welcome the Under-Secretary-General  Mr. Ronald I. Spiers - a distinguished diplomat - to his new poet  and we wish him well. We also congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  former Foreign Minister of Argentina  for a job well done. His presidency coincided with certain historic developments which have contributed to a new atmosphere that we must now profit from in our efforts to strengthen the United Nations  and prospects for justice and lasting world peace. There is no doubt that  in a real sense  the current international climate is far better than it has ever been within the lifetime of most of those who now inhabit this planet. We now have a chance finally to cross the threshold and ensure that mankind will not  through a nuclear conflict between the two super-Powers intentionally destroy life as we know it. None the less  many major problems continue to plague mankind  and we believe that sincerity  courage  dignity and integrity continue to be essential qualities in the process of building and preserving justice  peace and a better world for every roan  woman and child in every corner of the globe.We welcome and applaud the new openness  mutual respect and generally friendlier atmosphere that characterize current relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. However  we would be less than true to ourselves  and to history  were we to forget that many of the things that plague mankind today are not consequences of the post-Second-World-War antagonisms between these two great countries but  instead  result from old contradictions and grievances that predate the cold war and reveal the imperfections of the human species  as well as of the various institutions we have shaped.An astute observer once remarked   Man's mad vanity is often mocked by life . Thus  while some raced recklessly to build and deploy newer and more powerful weapons of mass destruction  nature demonstrated  with repeated regularity  that it could outdo mankind by in leashing hurricanes  cyclones  earthquakes  floods and droughts that gave us more than enough death and devastation - if that was what we wanted. While some experimented with  and developed  silent killers  such as chemical and bacteriological agents  nature gave us more than enough infectious disease  to satisfy any longing we might have to inflict pain and suffering on other human beings. While some obsessively consumed addictive drugs with hedonistic fervour# nature revealed that  eventually  those consumers become themselves consumed by their obsession.While some raced selfishly to build temples of pagan idolatry to material wealth  with little regard for the future well-being of our planet  nature responded to the repeated violation of our environment the only way it could - by revealing how scarce are the earth's resources  and how precarious its ability to support and sustain life. While some have expended their energy in misguided efforts to deny the humanity of others  merely because of differences in skin pigmentation  religious beliefs  cultural nuances  language or gender  nature has repeatedly revealed that if we cannot now be united in life we will most assuredly be forever united in death.It is time for us all to realize that if every one of us does not have a future none of us shall have a future. Thus  the Foreign Minister of the Philippines  Mr. Raul S. Manglapus  spoke for us all - not only for the poor people of his country - when  on 27 September 1989  he so eloquently stated  among other things t Today a human being is born not only with original sin but also withoriginal debt.  (A/44/PV.9  p. 38)This chilling reality  substantiated by the fact that the developing world now- owes the developed world more than $1.3 trillion  portends a future without hope for most of the world's people. Furthermore  this debt  which has already reached unmanageable proportions  continues to grow and grow and grow  with no apparent end in sight.We would be hard-pressed to recall a recent international meeting at which a discussion of the debt crisis  end other aspects of a general appeal for economic justice  had not played a prominent role. There are some encouraging signs that the urgency of this message has finally begun to penetrate. However  every day that this problem is left unresolved in a comprehensive fashion by the international community and the developing countries of the world nearer to an economic abyss and a potentially devastating social apocalypse.â>t all of the economic ills of the developing countries result from the actions - or lade of action - of the developed world. Naturally  developing countries must shoulder a fair share of the responsibility for the general malaise that exists in so many of their own economies. However  deteriorating terms of trade - characterized by severely depressed commodity prices  reverse flows of capital  and increasing protectionist pressures - have  for most of the world  made appeals for international economic justice a matter of great urgency.Greater fiscal responsibility and restraint are needed  but certainly not at the expense of those who are the most disadvantaged in the various developing countries. This would not only be Impolite it would also be immoral.Ironically  those who are among the first to counsel the adoption of rather severe fiscal restraints with respect to the social sectors of developing countries are often among the last to adopt far milder restraints themselves when it comes to military expenditures for new methods of death and destruction. Developing countries generally find It difficult to obtain sufficient economic credits to develop social Infrastructure. The same countries usually find it easier to obtain economic credits to fuel excessive military expenditures.While some nations were busy devoting considerable resources and energy to building and maintaining elaborate military defences against real and Imagined external enemies  another  less manageable and more Insidious  foe of us all was also busy. This foe developed an ability to threaten us all; regardless of our size regardless of our wealth  regardless of our power  regardless of our professed beliefs. This foe respects no international border  no set of laws  and no boundaries of decency. This foe is as brutal  as principled and as immoral as was an earlier foe - the international traffic in human beings known is the slave trade. Today's foe - the international traffic in narcotic drugs - poses a clear and present danger to contemporary civilized society. What it cannot seduce  it attempts to corrupt  what it cannot corrupt  it attempts to intimidate} what it cannot intimidate  it attempts to Hill and destroy.Those who engage in this traffic deserve neither our sympathy nor our mercy. They are evil incarnate  and must be confronted with all means at our disposal  just as the slave traders of earlier generations were confronted by decent human beings and civilized Governments and institutions  and just as latter-day practitioners of genocide were confronted by the international community during the Second World War  and later at International tribunals  which for ever contented crimes against humanity.Today  the courage of the Government and people of Colombia presents us with an historic challenge. Should we fail to meet that challenge - should we allow Colombia to stand alone in Its confrontation with evil - we shall have written the epitaph of modern civilization. The message of Mr. Virgilio Barco  President of Colombia  delivered here at the General Assembly on 29 September 1989  moved us all to stand in unison and applaud. Let that message also lead us to stand in unison and fight for the future of our respective peoples - for the future of our children.A young playwright  raised in a section of our host city that was recently in the news  has crafted a work striking in its similarities to a tragic event that occurred recently in his former neighbourhood. The plot of his play centres on an act of mindless racial violence and exposes the raw emotions of the play's characters. At the play's conclusion  a man who had stood by and watched the fatal beating of the black victim is surprised by the reaction of his girlfriend. To exculpate himself  he exclaims  ... life is short. The past is past. Let's worry about us. When the bomb hits  we're all going to die anyways. She pointedly replies t The world's not going to end with a bomb. It's going to end with people like you standing around doing nothing. One week after the play went into rehearsal  a tragic and much-publicized killing occurred in the community where the author had been raised and where the play was set. The theme of the play could just as easily have been about the international community's inaction in the face of drug trafficking it could just as easily have been about how the world has stood around watching the violent disintegration of Lebanon  it could just as easily have been about how some of us have stood around watching the intifadah in the occupied territories of Palestine. The theme of the play could just as easily have been about those who have been satisfied to be spectators each time the people of South Africa have demonstrated that they have had  ore than their fill of apartheid. The there could just as easily have been about those who chose to be spectators when the people of Namibia  the people of Hew Caledonia  or the people of other Non-Self-Governing Territories  decided to reclaim their own identities  their own sovereignty  their own futures.In this regard  we note the very moving appeal of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal  Mr. de Deus Pinheiro  that the international community not rent in indifferent to the situation in East Timor. The Government and the people of Vanuatu will never be indifferent to conditions in East Timor  Western Sahara  or other small Territories which some tend to overlook when they assess the current state of international relations. To us  the world has not progressed nearly as far as we would like to believe  if the peoples of those small Territories are not allowed freely to express their will and determine their r perspective futures.Closer to Vanuatu's own shores  the people of New Caledonia and the Government of Trance have embarked on an imaginative initiative  hid  could prove capable of providing a framework for a genuine act of self-determination and a just and lasting solution to the trouble -plagued history of that South Pacific Territory. We continue to support an early transition to an independent New Caledonia in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of New CalÂ® dm la's colonized people.The Reads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries continue to view the decolonisation process as an important international priority. At the Ninth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Countries  held in Belgrade  Yugoslavia  the Heads of State or Government reiterated and reaffirmed their commitment to the process by which most of the countries represented here today have won their political independence. On the specific subject of New Caledonia they  strongly urged that the question ... be kept under active consideration at the United Nations until the conditions for an internationally acceptable act of self-determination} in accordance with the principles and practices of the United Nations  have been met. The important process of dialogue has led to the restoration of peace and a calm political atmosphere in New Caledonia. As a neighbouring country Vanuatu applauds the measures taken to end the violence and reform the old social order. We will continue to support the process under way in New Caledonia so long as its people continue to work within that framework  and to view that process as a vehicle for the political evolution of their country.We are grateful for the understanding and support received from the international community on this issue. We know it is not always easy to understand and appreciate all of the nuances emanating from cries for justice by the people of a small Territory in a distant region. We also know it is not always easy - owing to other constraints and limitations - for a great Power to respond in a positive manner. France has demonstrated a greatness  as well as courage and compassion  by its willingness to listen to the grievances of New Caledonia's people  and by its willingness be fashion bold new initiatives in an effort to address those grievances.Nothing would please us more than to believe that the Government of South Africa is now possessed of the greatness  the courage  and the compassion to live up to its various undertakings to promote the decolonization of Namibia  and to help forge a new South Africa built on honesty  justice  and equality. However  wÂ· share the scepticism of those who doubt the sincerity of the current rulers of Pretoria. Namibia is on its way to independence despite the many road-blocks erected by the apartheid regime. He rejoice at the prospect of an independent Namibia assuming its rightful place within the community of nations. However# the rest of the world must assure that South Africa lives up to its commitments and not just those it finds convenient.With respect to South Africa itself it is clear that apartheid is doomed.This discredited doctrine of racial superiority has been repudiated by all# save those whose hearts and minds still reside in the early decades of the nineteenth century when the ownership of one human being by another was a socially acceptable method of attaining wealth and power.Today# those who imprisoned Nelson Mandela find that in his confinement he is freer than they are as his gaolers. His freedom is the freedom of a dignity that could never be diminished a will that could never be broken a conscience that could never be compromised. The confinement of his gaolers is the moral confinement of those who are consumed by nothing but greed and hatred.Those who govern South Africa attempted the impossible. They attempted the indefinite imprisonment of an entire country. Such repression nay succeed temporarily but history teaches that such success is always short-lived. Today# the largest gaolbreak in history is occurring. Soon South Africa will be free  and all of that country's people can share its wealth and will share its future.Hurricane Hugo which recently battered the Eastern Caribbean and parts of the United States has added its name to the long list of natural disasters that continue to plague mankind. He extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of Hugo and join in appeals for emergency and long-term assistance to help rebuild what was destroyed. As horrible as the consequences of the hurricane were  however t we cannot help but note that for some unfathomable reason  mankind still seems determined to match or even exceed nature in its destructive capabilities. The follies of mankind appear to have no limits.Thus while we mourn the victims of hurricane Hugo# nuclear testing continues in the South Pacific. Why? He cannot understand. Every delegation that has participated in the general debate has commented on a new positive international atmosphere and greatly enhanced prospects for world peace. Why  then must the people of the South Pacific continue to see their environment violated by the testing of nuclear weapons? For what conflict are these weapons necessary?Against whom have the peace-loving peoples of the Pacific sinned? Why must our lands  our waters* and our skies be used to test weapons that the people of no other region want tested on their lands  in their waters  or in their skies?We are pleased by recent expressions of concern for the environment. However  we find considerable irony in these expressions of concern. We are waiting for new voices to join us in appealing for an end to nuclear testing in our environment. We are waiting for new voices to join us in appealing for an end to the dumping of hazardous materials in our environment. We are waiting for new voices to join us in an appeal for an immediate end to the drift-net fishing that is devastating our marine ecology. We are waiting for new voice  to join us in appealing for a more equitable and universal distribution of the resources that have already been extracted from the Earth.We will continue to raise and articulate our strong environmental concerns. We will do so not to keep pace with any existing fashion  nor because of a new awareness of how fragile is the thread by which the environment supports life on this planet. We will do so because of our traditional respect for the very delicate balance of life we call our environment. We  ill do so because of our concern for the future  and because we know that our children - and their children - have no other place to go but the four corners of the Earth. We will do so because we do not want our world to end as a result of too many of us doing nothing - or not enough - when so much needs to be done.  "
"149",7505,"YEM",44,1989,"ï»¿Allow me at the outset of my statement to express to you  Sir  on behalf of the delegation of the Yemen Arab Republic and on my own behalf  our warmest congratulations on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. We are fully confident that your wide knowledge  expertise and ability will contribute greatly to the success of the work of the session.I am also pleased to express through you our heartfelt thanks and warm appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  who displayed throughout his presidency over the forty-third session great ability in guiding the proceedings of that session.The brilliant and efficacious efforts of Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar with regard to the issues facing the world last year and his good offices in finding suitable and just solutions impel me  on behalf of my country and on my own behalf to express to him our deepest gratitude and wish him further success in all endeavours entrusted to him.I wish also to congratulate the Under-Secretary-General and all those who work in this international organization  including the peace-keeping forces all over the world  who have dedicated their lives to the service of peace and the preservation of international security. I thank them for their sincere and meritorious efforts on behalf of peace and prosperity of mankind.The comprehensive and valuable report presented by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar on the role of the Organization and the tasks it has carried out throughout last year is cause for optimism. We are confident that our Organization  especially within the framework of the positive changes in the international arena  will be able to carry out its responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and security and that its ability will be enhanced in order fully to assume the role for which it was formed and prove to the international community that it is the best alternative and the only authority to solve all problems confronting our world today. Thanks in particular to the efforts of the Secretary-General and his associates  the United Nations has proved that the language of dialogue is the only means for achieving justice and consolidating peace. This was made evident in last year's detente on the path of peace concerning a number of international issues  such as Afghanistan  Namibia  Cambodia. Western Sahara and  last but not least  the relative tranquillity manifested on the border between Iraq and Iran by dint of the efforts of the Organization's Observers supervising the cease-fire there  notwithstanding the lack of concrete progress in the peace negotiations between the two countries to achieve a lasting  just and honourable peace in that region  a region that witnessed the longest and most ferocious war since the Second World War. This session was convened in an atmosphere of satisfaction and optimism owing to positive developments in international relations and also to the detente achieved between the two super-Powers. Some of the most positive indications of this detente are the continuation of negotiations to reach an overall solution to halt the nuclear-arms race and for general and complete disarmament  together with a mutual understanding and fuller co-operation between the super-Powers in order to eliminate hotbeds of tension and extinguish the flames of war throughout the world. To that end  appropriate and just solutions must be found through peaceful negotiations and by other peaceful means. We believe that co-operation in achieving settlements of disputes by peaceful means  guaranteeing the just and legitimate interests of oppressed peoples  is the most ideal alternative to a policy of confrontation and escalation  which usually pushes the world to the brink of an abyss and therefore has serious implications for the peace  security and stability of the world. All the members of the international family fully realize that ending any conflict inevitably requires that representatives sit down at a negotiating table and remove themselves entirely from the policy of imposed solutions and hegemony.In this respect  my country reiterates its full support for the total elimination of nuclear weapons by the nuclear-weapon States by the end of this century. We also support the repeated calls for banning nuclear-weapon tests and diverting the tremendous expenditures freed thereby to economic and social development in the interest of mankind as a whole  and particularly of the countries of the third world. No sooner had those countries freed themselves from the shackles of colonial domination than they fell victim to economic subservience as their resources became hostage to the debt problem. They are now subjected to the control of certain creditor States and creditor organizations by means of the prices that are set for their products.Despite the optimism prevailing on the international scene as a result of the trend towards the peaceful settlement of regional and international problems  the situation in the Middle East is still fraught with danger and poses a threat to peace not only in the region but in the entire world. That situation is the result of the aggressive policy pursued by Israel against the Arab Palestinian people  whose courageous intifadah is about to enter its third year. That heroic people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has been confronting the brutal force and oppression of the Israeli occupation only because it is claiming its legitimate tights. The occupying forces respond to those just demands by murder  expulsion  torture  imprisonment and the demolition of houses. The ruthless oppression and suppression are carried out against that people in contravention of human rights and international law and norms. Despite all that  there are those who  while unceasingly proclaiming respect for human rights  at the same time ignore these barbaric practices. In addition  a super-Power abstains from voting on any resolution that condemns the Zionist entity  which the international community has unanimously denounced and condemned. Here I must pay a tribute to  and honour all  those steadfast heroes under the yoke of the Israeli occupation - all those men  women Â¡I children and the elderly.The Yemen Arab Republic wishes to reaffirm its support for the efforts exerted to achieve a just and honourable peace in the Middle East  and in particular for the positive resolutions adopted by the Palestine National Council last November in Algiers. We agree with what was stated by brother Yasser Arafat  the head of the State of Palestine  at the forty-third session of the General Assembly in Geneva  when it convened to consider the item on Palestine. That session was held by our Organization to prove to the entire world the importance of this question and our responsibility in regard to it.Despite the fact that a whole year has passed since the General Assembly adopted resolutions at that session  and despite all the proposals made by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestine people  displaying a flexible position in response to the call for reason  justice and peace  Israel continues arrogantly to refuse to comply with the international community's resolutions by occupying the Arab territories in the West Bank  the Gaza Strip  the Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon. Israel persists in its acts of aggression against the defenceless Palestinian people. It categorically rejects all the calls for peace based on United Nations resolutions and rides roughshod over such resolutions. This demonstrates once again that for more than 40 years it has been carrying out its colonial settler policy and has had recourse to all types of acts of ruthless oppression and arbitrary actions.We call on the international community to shoulder its responsibility with regard to the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Arab territories and to compel the Zionist entity to respond to the call for peace by withdrawing immediately from the Arab territories that it has occupied since 1967 and to sit at the negotiating table with the parties concerned  foremost among which is the Ð LO  the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  at an international peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations  so that the Palestinian people may regain its tight to return to its homeland  to self-determination and to establish its independent State on its national soil.Moreover  we repeat that the major responsibility for achievement of that task rests  in the first place  with the five permanent members of the Security Council  in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.Proceeding from that premise  my country also reaffirms that it is not sufficient for one country to state that the ball is in Israel's court  while the leaders of the usurper entity continue to play with fire. The responsibility of those who are able to extinguish that fire is no less than the responsibility of those who set the fire in flames.With respect to the question of Lebanon  the good offices exerted by the tripartite Arab Committee established by the emergency Arab summit conference held in Casablanca give us a reason to be optimistic  because of the response made by all the parties concerned to the good offices of the Tripartite Committee and its endeavours. All the parties have demonstrated their sincere desire for a solution to the Lebanese crisis and their common conviction that it can be arrived at only through political dialogue and by peaceful means  and not by resorting to arms  which has proved futile for the past 13 years. We appeal to all peace-loving countries to exert every possible effort to ensure the success of the endeavours of the Tripartite Arab Committee to put an end to the Lebanese crisis  and to display solidarity with the Lebanese people so that it may preserve its national unity and sovereignty over its territory. An end must be put to the displacement of that people and the fear and suffering it has endured for many years. We also appeal to the international community to exert greater efforts and to bring real pressure to bear on the Zionist entity to induce it to withdraw from Lebanese territory  in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978).The Yemen Arab Republic appreciates the speedy acceptance by Iraq of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) the Islamic Republic of Iran did not accept it until one year after its adoption. Therefore  we wish to express our grave concern about the continuing state of no war no peace between Iran and Iraq. Intensification of the efforts of our Organization and all peace-loving countries is necessary to move from this situation  so fraught with danger  to direct and continuous negotiations between the two parties concerned in accordance with Security Council resolution 598 (1987). We consider that that resolution provides a comprehensive framework for the achievement of peace and for the removal of all obstacles and barriers to its implementation in letter and spirit  including persuading Iran to accelerate the process of the exchange of prisoners of war between the two parties. That is the ultimate test of good will and reaffirmation of the genuine desire to achieve durable peace and to solve all disputes by peaceful means in order to reach an agreement on a comprehensive and durable peace between the two countries and the return of normalcy to relations between them.The achievement of peace and stability around the Horn of Africa  the consolidation of the principles of good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries figure prominently in our regional policy. We therefore welcome the positive developments unfolding in relations between the States of the Horn of Africa. We also welcome the policy of co-operation and understanding between fraternal Sudan and the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. My country also supports the new peace initiative announced by the Ethiopian Government on the basis of which negotiations were launched under the auspices of former United States President Mr. Carter. My country welcomes the decision of the two negotiating parties to select from among a number of other capitals as the venue for their negotiations  and reaffirms it will do its best towards the attainment of an honourable and just solution guaranteeing peace stability  co-operation a\d national unity for the prosperity and progress of the peoples of the littoral States of the Red Sea.Preservation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity  and of its people's right to choose its economic and political system without outside interference or coercion  and strict observance of the Geneva Convention on this issue  represent for my country the keystone of the process of reaching a comprehensive and definitive settlement of the Afghan issue. Taking that as our premise  we wish to express our great satisfaction at the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghan territory. We appeal to this international Organization and its Secretary-General to intensify their efforts and make greater use of their good offices to assist in the reaching of a convergence of views between the Afghan parties in conflict so that security and national unity may be restored to the Afghan people and peace and stability nay prevail in the region.In our opinion ongoing negotiations and dialogue between the two Cypriot communities is the only way to achieve concord and the restoration of unity in Cyprus. The Organization's efforts to achieve a convergence of views between the two communities leading to settlement of their disputes must have our support so that the sovereignty and unity of Cyprus and the security and stability of the region may be preserved.The negotiations and meetings aimed at settlement of the Kampuchean crisis give us reason for optimism  especially after Viet Nam's declaration on the withdrawal of its troops from Kampuchea. This augurs well for settlement of the crisis in the near future so that the Kampuchean people may exercise its natural right of freedom and sovereignty on its territory in the absence of foreign intervention. As regards the situation on the Korean peninsula  we support efforts to achieve Korean reunification peacefully and democratically.Apartheid and the racial discrimination practised by the Pretoria regime is the root cause of the conflict  the continuing state of war and the destabilization in southern Africa  end constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security. The racist Pretoria regime still denies the most fundamental rights to the black majority in South Africa. It is pursuing a policy of aggression and interference in the affairs of the States of the area. This has led to destabilization in those States and is a hindrance to the efforts at economic development of the peoples of the region. The international community is duty-bound to provide moral and material support for the militant people of South Africa and to bring full pressure to bear on the racist South African regime to make it comply with the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.Positive steps have been made towards implementation of the United Nations plan for the independence of Namibia  credit for which goes to the efforts of our international Organization and its Secretary-General in the face of the challenges and barriers set up by the racist Pretoria Government to prevent the Namibian people from gaining its freedom and independence. On behalf of my country  I express gratification at the launching of the United Nations plan for Namibian independence  and at the same time I call on all the countries of the world  especially the major Powers  to stand by the efforts our Organization is making under the Namibian independence plan in accordance with Security Council resolution 43 5 (1978) to provide a favourable environment for free and fair elections to be held in all the provinces of Namibia. The important and positive developments taking place in Latin America are characterized by democratic principles and political harmony  and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. Moreover there is mutual respect for the right of the States of the continent to choose political and economic systems that suit their conditions and realities. There also exists a commitment not to interfere in the internal affairs of any State. All this requires that our Organization and the countries of the world support such efforts aimed at the achievement  once and for all  of peace and stability.The halting and banning of nuclear tests is one of the priorities of nuclear disarmament. In this respect we welcome the efforts of more than 40 countries directed at the holding of an international conference to amend the Partial Test Ban Treaty and make it a comprehensive convention banning nuclear tests. We also support the call to prevent an armaments race in outer space. As it is the common heritage of mankind  it should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. Proceeding from this premise  our international Organization has to play its rightful role in the field of disarmament and the non-militarization of outer space  together with the establishment of a stringent inspection system  to pave the way for further special sessions on disarmament.We in the Arab Yemen Republic are keen on reaffirming each and every year from this rostrum our stance on the paramount importance of keeping the Indian Ocean and its natural extensions free of the military presence of any foreign State and to turn it into a zone of peace  security and international co-operation  free of the threat of nuclear and chemical weapons. We also support the proposal to hold an international conference on this subject in the city of Colombo  capital of Sri Lanka  next spring.The progress achieved at the Paris Conference on Disarmament on the complete elimination of chemical weapons in which the signatories to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and other interested States participated  has proved beyond any doubt that the States of the world are convinced of the necessity of signing a general and comprehensive convention on the banning of the production  development  use and stockpiling of all chemical weapons and on their final destruction.In this respect my country wishes to express its deep concern over the international community's indifference to the Zionist entity's refusal to subject all its nuclear installations to international control which has encouraged this entity to continue in this course and to conduct tests on long-range missiles  increasing the anxiety and destabilization hanging over the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean  the main cause of which was and still is Israel.Significant events relating to international security have taken place and led to new directions in international relations. Serious negotiations have replaced direct conflicts. However for peace and security to prevail  the international community has to intensify its efforts. All countries of the world should participate and contribute equally.I wish to reaffirm on behalf of my country that there is a close link between disarmament and international detente and respect for the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. If this is coupled with the strict observance of the principles of equality in sovereignty among States  the settlement of disputes by peaceful means  non-recourse to the threat or use of force in international relations  respect for the right of all countries to self-determination and national independence  endeavours to achieve economic and social development  the elimination of colonialism  Zionism  racial discrimination  non-intervention in the internal affairs of States  and respect for human rights  peace and security can prevail.International peace and security cannot be achieved without the economic development of all countries of the world. The exacerbation of the development problems of developing countries threatens the positive gains that have been made in the field of international relations.The acute discrepancy between the astronomical military expenses on the one hand and the dire poverty in many developing countries on the other reaffirms the importance of stressing the concept of the link between disarmament and development in the third worldÂ·  but the bitter fact remains that the present international economic situation is still criticized and characterized by disequilibrium. The gap between the developed a\d developing countries is ever widening as a result of the disequilibrium in the terms of trade  the debt crisis  the higher interest rates and the collective trade barriers to which the developed countries have recourse. In addition  the reverse flow of resources from the developing countries to the developed countries poses a danger to international peace and security and a concrete barrier to the growth and development of the developing countries. Therefore  as much as we are interested in the outstanding political problems of the world  we are equally interested in the world's economic problems. Hence  we wish to reaffirm that the present international economic system needs to be amended and a new international economic order established based on equality amongst all the countries of the world  a system which would narrow the gap between the industrialized rich world and the impoverished third world.My country maintains that the suffering of the third-world countries through a stifling economic crisis and an economic situation characterized by disequilibrium and inequity requires that the international community intensify its efforts and strengthen co-operation in order to rebuild international economic relations on the basis of equity  justice and equal opportunity.We also maintain that it is necessary to hold an appropriate international forum  under the auspices of the United Nations  with the participation of the international financing institutions and the international banks  with the aim of defining concrete solutions to the crisis resulting from the foreign debt problem  in the framework of a favourable environment for continuous development and relief of the debt burden of developing countries which blocks their development and progress.In conclusion  I wish to indicate that the democratic march on the path of development and the achievement of Yemeni unity is increasing and becoming more solid day after day due to the wisdom of its political leadership  as represented by President Ali Abdullah Saleh  President of the Yemen Arab Republic  Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and Secretary-General of the General Popular Conference. I also wish to commend the historical steps taken by my country  together with the brotherly countries of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  the Republic of Iraq and the Arab Republic of Egypt  in February of this year by establishing the Arab Co-operation Council  which aims at achieving the highest degree of co-operation  co-ordination and integration amongst its four members in the economic  cultural and social fields. The aim is to achieve comprehensive co-operation and integration amongst all the Arab countries  especially with the Gulf Co-operation Council and the Maghreb Union.In conclusion  I wish to reaffirm our readiness to co-operate with you  Sir  in order to achieve the goals and purposes of this session of the General Assembly  through which we are seeking the prosperity  security and progress of humanity."
"150",7552,"YUG",44,1989,"ï»¿ It gives me pleasure to congratulate you  Sir  most cordially on your election as President of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. As a representative of a prominent African country  friendly Nigeria  and as a person of vast diplomatic experience and wisdom  you are eminently qualified to preside over this Assembly.At the same time  I wish to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Dante Caputo  the representative of Argentina  for his very successful presidency of the forty-third session.There are many reasons for which I should like to express special appreciation and gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar. I have primarily in mind his important contribution to seeking solutions to the most acute problems of the world during the past year.His view of the present state of international relations and its reflection upon the position and role of the United Nations  presented in his annual report on the work of the Organization  is indeed noteworthy.The Ninth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries was recently held in Belgrade  the capital of my country. I trust that the Assembly shares our conviction that this was one of the major international events this year.It is my great privilege and responsible duty to present to the Assembly the results of the Ninth Conference contained in the final documents and messages of that most important gathering of the non-aligned countries. I believe that in this way I shall contribute also to the consideration of the issues on the agenda of this year's General Assembly session.The Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries adopted a Declaration as well as a number of separate documents on specific questions in the political and economic fields. The summit documents reflect the views of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on current developments in international relations  as well as its aspirations to contribute to these processes.In the briefest possible terms  these views could be expressed as follows. After a long period of tension over the past few years the situation has started to change; world tensions are easing  and this is having a positive effect on the process of resolving some protracted world crises and problems. Basically what has been happening is what the non-aligned have always advocated  but the situation is still far from that which is desired. International relations today contain the characteristics of both the old and the new. Detente is far from being universal as wars are still being waged in many parts of the world. Political detente along East-West lines has not been followed by economic detente along North-South lines. The process of the pauperisation of the South is continuing  ""technological achievements can bring about vast improvements in the quality of life  but tragic destruction as well. While human rights are in some places a basic premise of living  elsewhere they are but a far-off objective.In the assessment by the non-aligned countries  the world is at a crossroads. There may be an acceleration in the progressive development of the international community  but there may also be drastic retrogression.In a world of growing interdependence  the non-aligned countries have expressed their readiness to bear their share of responsibility for resolving common problems. Accordingly they have opted for dealing also with those problems which are of growing concern to the entire international community  such as  for example  the issue of environmental protection and the drug problem.For decades we have been opposing confrontations in the world  aware of the fact that problems can be resolved only through dialogue and co-operation. We are determined to co-operate with all other countries of the world to that end  confident that realism will prevail over prejudice and dogma.In keeping with their views  in their Declaration the non-aligned countries highlighted several areas to which they assigned priority in their future work. The first priority is efforts to keep the peace  to achieve disarmament and to settle disputes by peaceful means.The notion of security is not confined to its military component. Closely associated with disarmament are: the observance of the principles of the United Nations Charter; the peaceful settlement of disputes; economic development; and respect for all collective and individual human rights.Now  when the veritable process of disarmament has finally been initiated  non-aligned countries continue to work for its strengthening and expansion. The  total elimination of nuclear weapons remains the primary objective. Yugoslavia  together with other non-aligned countries  gives top priority to a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. We also advocate the earliest possible adoption of a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and their elimination.At the Ninth Summit Conference the non-aligned countries also emphasized their readiness to make their full contribution to the initiation and realization of the process of conventional disarmament at global  regional and sub regional levels.I should like also to underline our full support for the central role and responsibility of the United Nations in the field of disarmament. Such a role would be further affirmed by the establishment of an integrated multilateral verification system under the auspices of the Organization.The next priority is a common quest for effective and acceptable solutions to the problems of international economic relations.In welcoming the positive changes in international relations the non-aligned countries at the Ninth Summit Conference pointed out that ""a detente devoid of economic content is unlikely to endure"". This specific assessment has been thoroughly elaborated: the ever-more-difficult position of developing countries whereby a majority of mankind is denied access to scientific and technological achievements is the major obstacle to global aspirations to integration on the basis of interdependence and equitable co-operation. Such a trend is not only an impediment to the faster and more-balanced development of the world economy as a whole  but also a latent threat to global peace and stability.In their analysis the non-aligned countries have noted the complex changes taking place in the world economy; its increasing multipolarity; new technological breakthroughs; the strengthening of integration groupings world wide; and reforms in socialist countries. These changes have new potentials for development but their course is intricate and their outcome uncertain. There are also new dangers of processes closing in and excluding third parties.However  practice increasingly is proving that the world economy is hard to manage on the basis of agreements reached in a narrow circle. The more favourable international political climate  the greater general awareness of interdependence and the years of relatively stable growth by developed countries could indeed be fertile ground for a new beginning in the North-South dialogue and co-operation.The messages of the Ninth Summit Conference and the ministerial meeting of the Group of 77 which preceded it unequivocally express the readiness of non-aligned and other developing countries jointly to seek effective and generally acceptable solutions to the key and interrelated problems of external debt  development  financing  trade  raw materials and technology  as well as to the specific and particularly acute problems weighing upon the least developed countries. We are convinced that today there are realistic conditions for establishing a new global development consensus and that this is an opportunity that the international community must not miss. I should like to point out that the external-debt problem of a considerable number of developing countries is one problem whose solution can no longer be postponed. The protracted economic stagnation of these countries and the constant outflow of capital  through external-debt servicing  to the economies of the developed countries cannot but have grave social and political effects on the debtor countries  as well as on the international community as a whole. We support the evolution in the position of creditors and the signs of their goodwill to approach this problem with more inventiveness  thus offering better prospects for its settlement  but we also wish to emphasize that it is necessary to deal with this problem in a more expedient and more efficient manner  in the interests of all.We do not expect that solutions to all problems can be found here in the United Nations. It is necessary to combine action at national  regional and global levels. The specialized agencies and forums have a clearly defined role. However  it is from this universal and most democratic forum that the very necessary political impulse and guidelines should be given to ensure that all activities are coherent and conducive to the creation of conditions favourable for the more rapid inclusion of developing countries in the mainstream of the world economy. More fruitful communication and the reaching of agreement on a larger number of key economic and development issues would at the same time constitute the best guarantee of the success of the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly scheduled for April next year.The imperative need for a new development consensus also requires the political engagement of countries at the highest level. Therefore  the idea of regular consultations between the leaders of the North and South is a timely one and deserves our full support.The next important priority for the non-aligned countries is support for the right of all peoples living under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation to self-determination and independence. Stressing their commitment to the goal of complete eradication of colonialism  the non-aligned countries once again pledged to strengthen their solidarity with non-aligned and other countries facing aggression  intervention or interference in their internal affairs. The greatest remaining colonial problem  Namibia  is hopefully being brought to an end. The process of gaining independence on the basis of Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  which is now taking place and is the focus of the attention of the entire world public  represents a victory for long efforts made primarily within this Organization of ours to end the illegal occupation by South Africa. That process is now entering its final but most critical stage. It is our responsibility to prevent through resolute action all attempts to thwart the United Nations plan at the last moment. The people of Namibia must not be prevented from freely expressing their will at the elections.To this end  in a special Declaration adopted at the ninth summit meeting  the non-aligned countries called upon the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations urgently to take a series of measures to counter all possible future violations of the United Nations plan. However  this time the non-aligned countries are also taking action themselves. Their fact-finding mission  which visited Namibia early in August  will return there to oversee the November elections and report immediately to the Movement. Together with its other actions of support and assistance to the Namibian people  now and in the future  and in keeping with its fundamental goals and priorities  the Non-Aligned Movement is thus demonstrating in practice its active solidarity with peoples in the process of gaining their freedom.BConsistent with the positions of the Movement  the Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries most strongly condemned the continuous existence of the system of apartheid and supported the continuation of all existing measures and the taking of new ones for its elimination. At the same time  by adopting the Harare Declaration of 21 August of the Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  they supported the determination of the people of southern Africa to put an end to apartheid through peaceful means and  negotiation. That determination is fully in line with the current situation in international relations  and our Organization is in duty bound to use all its influence to prevent this courageous and wise move of the people of Africa from being frustrated. A historic responsibility now rests upon South Africa. The road towards peace and co-operation in the region or the road towards an eruption of revolt by the subjugated people and bloodied is the choice it has to make. All that is rational and humane in man tells us there cannot be  there must not be  a dilemma.Other points of crisis and instability in the world also require our urgent and undivided attention. At this favourable moment  it is our responsibility  as Members of this Organisation  to use every avenue to bring about the successful completion  or at least the speeding up  of the processes that have been initiated for their (solution  or to restart them where they have come to a halt.We believe that it is indeed high time that the statesmanlike and constructive position of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people  be met with an equally worthwhile and constructive response on the part of other principal factors on whom the peace process in the Middle East depends. While welcoming every partial step which might bring that region closer to peace  we feel that the continuing opposition to the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations and with the full participation of the PLO should be overcome as soon as possible. The vast majority of the countries of the world long ago expressed their support for this realistic way towards a comprehensive solution to the Middle East crisis  which would create the possibility for all countries in the region to live in safety and peace within their territories.The tragic escalation of conflict further endangers the prospect of bringing unity  full sovereignty and territorial integrity to non-aligned Lebanon and prolongs the suffering of its people. Now is the time for all factors concerned to assist the continued efforts of the Arab Tripartite Committee which  enjoying the broadest support  could lead to a situation in which the vicious circle of violence might be broken and replaced by agreements.A political solution to the problem of Afghanistan requires that the Geneva Agreements be consistently and completely implemented and that all their signatories and guarantors consistently abide by the letter and spirit of those Agreements. This would facilitate the opening of an intra-Afghan dialogue  aimed at establishing a broad-based Government comprising representatives of all segments of the people of Afghanistan.Although this summer's conference on Cambodia in Paris did not yield a comprehensive solution  the momentum of diplomatic efforts must not be allowed to abate. Slow and laborious as it may be  the negotiating process is bringing certain results  strengthening hopes that conditions will soon be created for the people of Cambodia freely to determine their destiny. The withdrawal of foreign troops is certainly the most important step in that direction.The recent peace agreement of the Presidents of five Central American countries concluded in Tela  Honduras  has  it is to be hoped  removed hindrances to the implementation of the Esquipulas II peace Agreement. Welcoming the actions of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States in support of international verification of the implementation of the peace Agreements  I wish to express our conviction that strict observance of those Agreements by all is essential for the achievement of lasting peace in the region.The consistent and full implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987) remains the basis for achieving a comprehensive  just  honourable and durable settlement of the conflict between Iran and Iraq.As regards Western Sahara  we are convinced that full co-operation by all parties with the United Nations Secretary-General and the Chairman of the OAU in their further efforts is essential if there is to be a just and definitive settlement. Despite all the difficulties  we believe that continuation of the Secretary-General's good offices and the inter-communal talks  in an atmosphere marked by an overall improvement in international relations  will lead finally to decisive breakthroughs in resolving the Cyprus problem. The way to the peaceful reunification of Korea is through dialogue and mutual confidence-building  in conformity with the principles of the 1972 North-South joint statement.Next on the list of priorities of the non-aligned countries is the environmental protection problem. The dangers menacing the atmosphere  the seas and the forests today threaten all countries alike and dramatically highlight the interdependence of the contemporary world. Proceeding from that conviction  the non-aligned countries voiced their full readiness to contribute to the strengthening of global co-operation to protect and improve the environment. They also stressed that this objective can be realized only within the context of growth and development  and with the allocation of additional resources  giving developing countries access to ecologically cleaner technologies and making possible their active participation in global ecological co-operation. It is on that basis that the non-aligned countries will call  at the forty-fourth session  for the adoption of a final decision on convening the World Conference on Environment and Development in 1992.The next priority is the full realization of human rights and freedoms. The non-aligned countries stress that the right of every individual to full enjoyment of civil  political  economic  social and cultural rights is the source of the greatest inspiration to the Movement  and one of its basic objectives. They confirmed that they share fully the wide and growing recognition of the special importance of the full enjoyment of human rights and freedoms  both collective and individual. Indeed  there can be no rights and freedoms of people without the individual rights and freedoms of every person. We in Yugoslavia believe that the extent to which an individual enjoys fundamental rights and freedoms is the measure of the degree of democratisation of the society and of the possibility of their inclusion in broader democratic processes in the world to which we aspire.In this context  one should  however  bear in mind the fact that civil and political rights cannot be separated from the economic  social and other rights and needs of man  and that in a great majority of developing countries the economic and social conditions are quite difficult. Finally  the non-aligned countries are pledged to strive to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations in discharging its legitimate responsibility for resolving all major problems of the world. For this purpose  they will endeavour to ensure that the machinery of the Organization is reinforced  and its activities efficiently coordinated - convinced that  as they have stressed  the role of multilateralism is growing at both the global and the regional levels. I am confident that this view is shared by other members of the Organization.Those are the priorities set by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at their ninth summit in Belgrade. My country fully supports and endorses them and  as co-ordinator of the activities of the non-aligned countries  will endeavour to see them realized in the near future. On the basis of their political decisions  and in keeping with these priorities and with their positions on specific issues  the non-aligned countries approach the work of this session determined to make a constructive contribution. This session of the General Assembly  like the last one  is being held in an international climate amenable to the consideration of crucial world issues. This facilitates our work  but also heightens our responsibility for future developments. It is our special responsibility  by ensuring the success of this session  to make a substantive contribution to the strengthening and further affirmation of the United Nations in resolving key global problems. May the forty-fourth session of the Genera] Assembly bring more genuine co-operation and less confrontation than any previous one. If we achieve that  the results will more than live up to our expectations. What is more  we might even manage to overcome some of the psychological limits that ingrained beliefs and long-established practice impose on us. Those are the factors that limit  perhaps even imperil our future."
"151",7616,"ZMB",44,1989,"ï»¿Let me start by expressing ray delegation's sincere congratulations to Mr. Garba on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly. His election to that high office is clear testimony of his widely acknowledged deep understanding of the many and complex problems that beset mankind today. We represents a friendly and peace-loving country with which Zambia and the other front-line States have joined efforts to bring about peace in southern Africa. We are therefore happy to see him in that hot seat.To his predecessor  Mr. Dante Caputo  the former Foreign Minister of Argentina  we wish to pay a deserving tribute for the very able manner in which he guided the deliberations of the forty-third session of the General Assembly. He came to the throne at a very crucial time during the developments in southern Africa. We wish him well in his new endeavours.To the Secretary-General of our organization  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  we wish to express Zambia's profound appreciation for his continuing efforts and commitment to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts  we wish him success in his noble and difficult task. We meet today against a background of great hopes and expectations for the success of multilateralism  which is so vital for the well-being of mankind. The climate of co-operation and accommodation between the two super-Powers has had global ramifications and augurs well for the gradual elimination of tensions. We look forward to the end of the cold war era which has been characterized by the unprecedented arms race.As we approach the last decade of this century  which has witnessed two major and destructive wars  among others  our efforts should be geared to ensuring that we lay a solid foundation for the eventual elimination of all weapons off mass destruction. The issue off arms control and disarmament must be off high priority if we are to avoid a nuclear holocaust  which could be triggered either by accident or by miscalculation. Indeed  there are also other compelling reasons in favour of ending the arms race  one off which is that the limited resources off the world cannot sustain the ever growing production and improvement off weapon systems off mass destruction. It goes without saying that the world  particularly the developing countries  would have a lot to gain from the reallocation of resources into economic and social development. In this regard  we welcome the ongoing efforts for a reduction not only in the levels of nuclear weapons of the super-Powers  but also in the conventional forces in Europe. He also welcome recent initiatives to stop the production of chemical weapons. It is our hope that these efforts will lead to the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.Nearer home  there is now some hope of an end to the colonial situation in Namibia. After more than 100 years of colonialism  the settlement plan embodied in Security Council resolution 435 (1978) is in the process of implementation. But the implementation process remains a matter of serious concern to the international community  with the elections less than four weeks away  a number of issues pertaining to implementation off the resolution remain unsolved. We have repeatedly stated  in this Assembly and elsewhere  that South Africa has sinister intentions in Namibia  aimed at denying the South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) its deserved electoral victory. It is no secret that South Africa intends to retain its influence in Namibia by arrogating to itself a role in the evolution off the Constitution of the new State of Namibia by ensuring that SWAPO does not get the required two-thirds majority. Widespread intimidation off SWAPO supporters  particularly in northern Namibia  by Koevoet elements must be seen as one of South Africa's desperate attempts to achieve that objective - no doubt  the last kicks of a dying horse.The assassination of a prominent SWAPO member  Mr. Anton Luborski  in Windhoek  underscores our expressed concern for the security of the leadership off SWAPO. The existing law-enforcement agents in Namibia are  by their training and background  unsuitable for the protection of SWAPO leaders. It must be stated that if assassinations of SWAPO leaders continue  the process of implementing Security Council resolution 435 (1978) could be seriously jeopardized. We call on the Secretary-General to take urgent measures to resolve this problem.Under the settlement plan  all military paramilitary and citizen forces  commandos and ethnic forces were to be disbanded  and their command structures dismantled. Regrettably  South Africa has not  so far  complied fully with the requirements of resolution 435 (1978)  and has thus created an atmosphere of uncertainty and uneasiness  which is not conducive to the conduct of free and fair elections in Namibia. We wish to reiterate that failure to implement resolution 435 (1978) in its original and definitive form could seriously tarnish the image of the United Nations  under whose supervision and control the elections in Namibia are being conducted.South Africa's sincerity is on trial in Namibia. Its behaviour during the electoral process will determine whether its promises to end apartheid can be believed by the international community.The United Nations should ensure that all the remaining discriminatory and restrictive laws in Namibia are repealed  as provided for under the settlement plan. Similarly  both the electoral law and the Constituent Assembly proclamation should conform to the provisions of Security Council resolutions 435 (1978) and 640 (1989)  in keeping with internationally accepted standards  so that the people of Namibia can freely exercise their right to self-determination and national independence. Indeed  in his comprehensive report to the General assembly at this session  the Secretary-General  refer rim to implementation of the settlement plan  stated  ""there are serious problems to be overcome"" (A/44/1  p. 3).We wish to reiterate that the United Nations has direct responsibility for Namibia until independence is achieved. For that reason  it is absolutely essential that the General Assembly provide the necessary financial resources to enable the Council for Namibia to carry out its programme of work for 1990 until independence. Indeed  in this regard  the United Nations should mobilize resources to assist Namibia during the transition period and beyond.It must be emphasised that the newly independent Namibia will need further assistance in the integration of various military units into the national defence force. In this connection  we believe that the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) can play a role to ensure orderly integration. We therefore call on the United Nations to consider retaining some military elements of UNTAG in Namibia after independence  for this purpose.In South Africa nothing much has changed  despite recent pronouncements  including yesterday's  by the new leadership. The system of apartheid  which the United Nations has rightly condemned as a crime against humanity  is still intact. There are still no clear indications pointing to the immediate abolition of apartheid. Nelson Mandela and many other political prisoners remain in South African gads. The Group Areas Act and the state of emergency are still in force.In order to achieve peaceful change in South Africa  the Pretoria regime must  as a matter of urgency  engage in serious dialogue with genuine leaders of the black majority. To that end  we call upon the Pretoria regime to: release unconditionally all political prisoners  and not just a few; unban the African National Congress  the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania and all other political organizations in South Africa and ensure the return of all political exiles without hindrance) lift the state of emergency-  halt political executions and detention  and withdraw the army from the townships.Those demands are contained in a very important document adopted by the organization of African Unity's Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa  which met in Harare  Zimbabwe  in May this year. That document is  in our opinion  the blueprint for ending apartheid peacefully. Much has been said about the effectiveness of economic sanctions against South Africa. In our assessment  the economic and financial sanctions new in place are having the desired effect. In this regard  we wish to express our appreciation to the countries that have individually imposed sanctions on South Africa  and we urge them to continue applying those sanctions until apartheid is completely eradicated. Similarly  we appeal to those countries which  for selfish interests  are opposed to sanctions against South Africa to reconsider their position  because the alternative is a bloody armed conflict  which would not be in the interests of any of the peace-loving nations. He wish also to appeal to the international community to observe strictly the mandatory arms embargo  in terms of Security Council resolution 418 (1977)  and the United Nations oil embargo against South Africa. Economic interests cannot supersede human rights.Apartheid is the root cause of tension and conflict in southern Africa. It is in defence of apartheid that South Africa has  over the years  engaged in acts of aggression against  and destabilization of  front-line and other States in our region. This has been done through direct action and the use of surrogate elements  such as UNITA bandits in Angola and RENAMO bandits in Mozambique. In a recent United Nations Children's Fund publication  the overall cost  so Car  of aggression and destabilization in the region is estimated at $46 billion.As a result of South Africa's direct military action against Angola and Mozambique and its support of bandit groups  thousands of refugees from these countries have sought sanctuary in Zambia and other neighbouring countries. Until recently  Zambia also gave sanctuary to thousands of refugees from Namibia  most of whom have since returned home under the terms of Security Council resolution 435 (1978).We stress that despite its limited resources  Zambia will continue to give shelter and sanctuary to our displaced brothers and sisters who are victims of aggression by the apartheid regime. So far it is estimated that South Africa's aggression has resulted in the loss of 1.2 million lives. We therefore call on the international community to continue to give diplomatic and material assistance to the front-line and other independent African States in the region in order to enable them to withstand the effects of South Africa's aggression and destabilization.Zambia welcomes the mediation efforts currently under way for the attainment of peace in Angola and Mozambique. We believe that  without external interference in the internal affairs of those countries  solutions for a lasting peace can be found. To this end  we continue to appeal to the United States Administration to cease all its assistance to UNITA so that Angola's efforts for national reconciliation may yield fruit. Similarly  South Africa should cease its assistance to the RENAMO bandits in Mozambique in order to facilitate the current mediation efforts by Kenya and Zimbabwe.Since its independence Zambia has developed and maintained friendly relations with neighbouring countries. We strongly believe in the resolution of disputes through dialogue as one way of promoting good-neighbourliness. Indeed  this is in conformity with the United Nations Charter which provides for the resolution of international disputes by peaceful means  in such a manner that international peace  security and justice  are not endangered. As members are aware  after years of dialogue  Zambia and Zaire have bilaterally resolved a long-standing border dispute between them.In Western Sahara  we remain supportive of the efforts by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to organise a referendum in which the Sahraoui people would be given the right to decide the political destiny of their country. Zambia wishes to express its pleasure at the turn of events regarding the relationship between Chad and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. We welcome the agreement signed at Algiers on 31 August 1989  establishing diplomatic relations between the two neighbouring countries.Elsewhere in Africa  we are following with great interest various efforts that are being deployed to reduce tension and strife.In the Middle East  one long-standing issue is the question of Palestine  the core of the conflicts in the region. Unless the question of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians is justly addressed  peace in the Middle East will be unattainable. Zambia therefore supports unequivocally the convening of the International Peace Conference on the Middle East with the participation off all parties to the conflict  including the Palestine Liberation Organization  on an equal footing. The heroic intifadah is a clear demonstration that nothing will stop the Palestinian quest for freedom  dignity and their eight to a homeland.In Lebanon  we call for the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of all foreign forces in order to create an atmosphere conducive to the resolution off the problem by the Lebanese people on their own. Meanwhile  Zambia welcomes the mediation efforts by the League off Arab States.In the Gulf  the guns have fallen silent but the cease-fire remains precarious because Security Council resolution 598 (1987) has not been fully implemented. Further effort on the part of the international community is necessary in order to bring lasting peace to the region. We therefore call upon the parties directly involved to co-operate with the Secretary-General in his continuing efforts to implement Security Council resolution 598 (1987).In Afghanistan  the withdrawal of Soviet forces  far from bringing about a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful resolution of the problem  seems to have set the stage for self-annihilation. The wounds of a prolonged conflict in that troubled country have endured beyond expectations. We appeal to all who may have an influence on the parties to the conflict to play their role in bringing about a climate conducive to the full implementation of the Geneva Agreements.In Cyprus we must work for the elimination of mistrust  which is the root cause of the present situation. In this regard  we call for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from the area in order to pave the way for the success of the intercommunal talks. The Secretary-General of our Organization should similarly be encouraged to continue his mediation efforts.Kampuchea has seen long years of devastation and extreme suffering. We are encouraged by the recent announcement of the Vietnamese authorities concerning total withdrawal of their forces from Kampuchea  we call on the international community and the member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations in particular to ensure the success of the peaceful efforts through the Jakarta Informal Meetings.In the Korean peninsula we must work for the dismantling of the artificial barriers which have long prevented the reunification of the two Koreas. In tills connection  the presence of foreign forces In the peninsula must be seen as a serious obstacle to the peaceful resolution of the Korean problem. We call upon all concerned to take advantage of the improved International political climate to seek out ways of bringing an end to this long-standing problem.The situation in Central America Is a source of serious concern to all peace-loving people in the world. Zambia has supported the peace Initiatives of the Contactors countries and the Esquipulas II Agreement aimed at the peacefulresolution of the problems in Central America. The Tela meeting held recently is a further step by the people of the region to see to it that their problems are resolved by peaceful means. This meeting  which has sought the active involvement of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and that of the Organization of American States  deserves the fullest support of the international community.Drug abuse and drug trafficking have become a serious social menace. Encouraged by the high yields from the sale of illicit drugs  the drug cartels have acquired the status of private armies  threatening the security of both supplier and consumer countries. The world must take a united stand against this new threat and make it impossible for drug money to be laundered and for the drugs to reach intended users. In this regard  Zambia has enacted legislation against drug trafficking and consumption. At this session the Assembly cannot fail to focus attention on the serious international economic situation. The positive and encouraging signs the world community is witnessing in the political and military spheres are at variance with the trends of international economic relations.For the majority of the people of the world  the problem of external debt continues to pose a great danger to their economic and social well-being. Last year  developing countries received $92 billion from developed countries in various forms of development aid. In turn  these countries exported $142 billion to the developed countries to repay old loans  thus producing a net transfer of financial resources worth $50 billion to the developed countries. This trend of negative transfers has been rising since 1984  when it first emerged. In simple economic terms  the trend translates into a dehumanising life of poverty  malnutrition  infant mortality and moral degradation faced by many people of the developing world.Over the years  many developing countries have embarked on various programmes to restructure their economies  which have yielded positive rates of growth.We are happy that debt reduction has been widely accepted as a means leading towards resolving the critical debt problem. However  debt reduction as envisaged in the Brady Plan still remains widely unrealised. Practical results remain elusive because of the problem of under-financing owing to the lack of a consensus on how far the commercial banks and international financial institutions should be committed to debt reduction. The international financial institutions must obviously continue to play a major role in tine process of debt reduction This will inevitably require extra resources being made available to these institutions so that funds committed to debt reduction are additional to current levels of financial flows.My Government appreciates the efforts made by creditor countries to cancel some outstanding debts in respect of developing countries. In the case of Zambia  this measure has provided the critical financial support so urgently required to establish a minimum level of import capacity and ease the burden of adjustment. Notwithstanding this support  further measures of debt reduction are still needed to stimulate sustained growth. This is a reality not only for Zambia but for all debt-distressed countries.The case for more liberal access by developing countries to markets in developed countries remains as valid as ever. More positive commitments to liberalization within the framework of the Uruguay Round are needed in order to give real opportunities to developing countries to expand output and export earnings.It should be remembered that the relative weakening of the growth of the output of developing countries and tine decline in foreign exchange earnings caused by the shrinking import capacity brought about by debt-servicing and poor export prices has also had the unfavourable impact of reducing trade among themselves  From a share of 7.8 per cent of global trade in 1981  trade among developing countries shrank to 5.1 per cent in 1987. This negative development has come at a time when preferential trading arrangements have been evolved to establish better complementarities in the production structures of developing countries as a way of rapidly modernizing their economies and improving their position in the international division of labour. In the face of formidable regional trading blocks emerging in the industrialized countries  this shrinkage threatens to marginalize the developing countries further  since they are already less important markets for developed countries.Trends in markets for primary commodities  as reflected by tine recent collapse in tine prices of coffee  palm oil  bananas  aluminium and maize are far from favourable. This is due to a number of factors  including substitutes and recent advances in science and technology  which are reducing demand for primary products. My delegation welcomes the launching of the Common Fund for Commodities as a viable means of stabilizing export earnings from primary commodities.The international community is not without opportunities and means for a global attack on underdevelopment. We have the opportunities offered by the spirit of multilateralism  to which we all subscribe. The United Nations and its specialized agencies remain indispensable forums for negotiating a liberal  viable and durable system of international relations to govern sustained development for all the people of the world. Multilateralism offers commonality of interests  a basis upon which joint efforts to combat underdevelopment can be adopted and implemented. It is in this context that my delegation welcomes ongoing preparations for tine special session of the United Nations devoted to international economic co-operation  scheduled for April 1990  the international development strategy for tine Fourth United Nations Development Decade and tine United Nations conference on environment and development  scheduled for 1992.We also have the opportunities offered by the growing interdependence of the economies of the world. Interdependence remains a valid means of expanding global economic opportunities so that the awful waste of human resources now going on in the developing countries is halted. The rapid developments in science and technology  coupled with changes in factor endowments and market forces  provide the world economy with comparative advantages that are potentially beneficial to the vast majority of countries currently faced with the crisis of underdevelopment. It requires only the political will of the major actors in the world economy to let the laws of the market forces take their course.As called for by the General assembly in its resolution endorsing the new international economic order  developing countries must be enabled to participate meaningfully in the world economy. The political  ideological and moral dangers inherent in the present global imbalances far outweigh the risks of enabling developing countries to participate more fully in the formulation of a global economic policy and have a greater share in the vast opportunities for development.There is now widespread awareness of the critical role played by a safe environment in the survival and sustained development of mankind. Indeed  there must be a serious attempt to produce without destruction. In this context  Zambia has enacted legislation on the environment. This legislation makes it mandatory for policy makers to ensure that all issues concerning the environment are fully incorporated in national development plans.Zambia welcomes international co-operation on environmental issues because the various agents of stress on and damage to the environment are essentially of an international character. It is in this spirit that Zambia looks forward to theconvening in 1992  in Brazil  of the united Nations conference on environment and development. It is our hope that the conference will provide guidelines on a global scale for maintaining the man-nature balance.Co-operation is very new in the long history of mankind. The heroic spirit of multilateralism now emerging with the growing prestige and constructive role of the United Nations in world affairs has laid a firmer foundation for mankind's supreme struggle for oneness  comfort  security and prosperity. My delegation would like to leave the Assembly with the firm conviction that this foundation will be used scrupulously by all countries of the world to resolve the outstanding problems of peace  democracy  underdevelopment  illicit drug use and trafficking and environmental degradation. Heads of State and Government and national delegations who have spoken before me have shared with us the same view.I wish the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly all success in its deliberations."
"152",7650,"ZWE",44,1989,"ï»¿I should like at the outset to express my delegation's satisfaction and pleasure at your election  Sir  to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session. The unanimity of that decision reflects not only your own distinguished record as Foreign Minister and Permanent Representative of your country to the United Nations but also the prestige of your country  Nigeria  of which all of us in Africa are proud.The outgoing President of the General Assembly  Mr. Dante Caputo of Argentina  shouldered the responsibility of his office with distinction in a momentous and difficult year. We wish to acknowledge our debt to him.Our Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  has been at the head of our Organization during some of its roost troubled and also some of its most productive and successful years. The turnaround in the fortunes of the United Nations during his watch owes much to the skill of the helmsman and we want to reassure him of our continued confidence.The current session of the General Assembly must seriously address itself to problems affecting the world economy. In the vital field of international economic relations  the fresh breeze that has led to such excitement in international political relations has not even made a ripple. The direction of the world economy is still determined by a small circle of rich and powerful nations for which short-term expediency and the requirements of individual national economies have all too often taken precedence over the steps required for a healthier world economy from which all States would benefit in the long run. For the smaller countries the result has been a collapse in commodity prices causing severe prejudicial terms of trade  where several times the volume and quality of produce is now required to purchase the same amount of manufactured goods from the North than was required only a few years ago. In addition  the necessary borrowing on the part of the developing countries  coupled with high interest rates  has resulted in a debilitating debt-service burden for those countries that has culminated in a net reverse transfer of resources from South to North in the order of nearly $50 billion annually according to the calculations of international financial institutions. Fifty billion dollars annually is a very big amount to owe and we ate informed that more money is still continuing to flow from the developing countries to the developed countries. How can we  in all conscience  talk of kinder  gentler times and continue to countenance the continual transfer of such a phenomenal amount of resources from the poor and the hungry to the rich and the affluent? We welcome the positive developments on the international political stage and we believe that all peoples should enjoy political and civil rights. Conscience  however  enjoins us to submit that these rights are not enough. People have economic and social rights as well: the right to good health  the right to food and shelter  and above all the tight to a decent standard of living. It should be the lot of no one to suffer the degradations of illiteracy and poverty. Hunan rights are a package the elements of which are mutually reinforcing  and the denial of any of them weakens the entire package. A poor man  a sick man and an illiterate man are just as manacled as the man who is denied individual freedom or the right of free speech. It is the package that is important  for it goes beyond the selective  and at times cynical  championing of this or that right to the core of the purpose of existenceÂ·  the tight to a decent and meaningful life. Any attempt to separate one from the other or to compartmentalize these rights and champion one right at the expense of the other is to sow confusion and set the stage for futile recriminations.All States represented in the Assembly should subscribe to that view and attempt to pursue the objective of a good and decent existence for all human beings. The pursuit of a healthier world economy  of growth and development of the poorer countries and of fairer terms of trade between the North and the South is fundamentally a struggle for human rights and for the tight of people to a decent existence.In our interdependent world that struggle must involve a concerted approach  including greater recourse to multilateral mechanisms on the part of all States. Nations must act together to solve the global and interrelated problems of the world economy  as low commodity prices  high interest rates and acute external Indebtedness. The politics of inclusion that appear to be gaining ground in international political relations  particularly through professions by the big Powers of their readiness to give a larger role in the management of international affairs to the United Nations  should also be reflected in international economic relations.The initiative taken by the developing countries in urging the Assembly to hold a special session on economic co-operation  in particular for the revitalization of the growth and development of developing countries  in April 1990  is a timely development. The special session should focus on the need to renew the stalled North-South dialogue and on the direction of the world economy. I am pleased to note that the recent summit Conference of the Countries of the Non-Aligned Movement  held at Belgrade  endorsed this suggestion and all the member States of the Non-Aligned Movement will be co-operating in the exercise. In this era  when economic mega-blocs are in the process of being formed in North America and in Europe  and where East and West are drawing closer in many spheres  it is essential that developing countries are not left out of the discussions and the mechanisms that will affect the future course of international economic and political relations. We also note that preparations are under way for the elaboration of the international development strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade. We wish to stress the complementarity we see between that process and next year's special session on economic co-operation  to which I have already referred.Following the 1986 special session of the General Assembly on the critical economic situation in Africa  the Assembly adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. That Programme represented a compact between the African countries and the international community  especially the donor countries. The African countries were to take steps to redress their economies through structural adjustment programmes  which they have done - often at a significant social and political cost - and the international community undertook to create an international environment conducive to African recovery by facilitating an increase in commodity prices and resource 21ows to the continent. The mid-term review of the implementation of the Programme  annexed to resolution 43/27 of 1988  clearly states that the international community has not kept its side of the bargain. The African States have made the adjustments that were required of them. Let me echo the words of Mr. Michael Manley  Prime Minister of Jamaica  when he sand recently:  We have done everything that was asked of us. But what has the other side done?  Commodity prices have continued to fall and resource flows to Africa have not increased in any appreciable way. Given the sacrifices the African countries have made to keep their part of the bargain  it is important that the Programme be made o work. Since the review of the Programme will take place in 1991  and the programme itself is to run only up to 1990  it is important that the Programme be mandated to run until the final review  and we hope that decision will be taken at this session. Problems of the environment affect the entire globe  which is our common abode  and many speakers have referred to this important factor. From the depletion of the ozone layer to the poisoning of the atmosphere and the rivers  the degradation of the environment affects all of us. The global warming of the general climate affects com tries in Europe  in the Americas  Africa and everywhere. For us in Africa the problem of the environment is important as we face what one representative has described here as the encroaching deserts. We have heard from many delegations of the encroachment of the desert on to their own fertile lands. We also have the related problem of the dumping of nuclear and toxic wastes which have been the subject of resolutions by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the International Atomic Energy Agency and the General Assembly itself  last year. Greater responsibility is needed in the way the world uses its natural resources and disposes of the dangerous waste products of its factories. In the last year representatives will have read press reports about the very dangerous dumping of wastes in certain African countries  which action was rightly condemned by the OAU and other internal forums. We therefore welcome the intention to hold a special international conference on the environment in 1992. We are also aware that all too often the weak ate made to pay for the sins of the strong - if only because controlling the strong is so much more difficult. It is important that the burden attendant upon safeguarding the environment should be shared judiciously according to resource usage  waste production and need. Particularly  it is essential that no new obstacles are put in the path of the economic progress of the developing countries  which are already at the receiving end of the imbalances and inequities of the present international economic order and of the abuse and misuse of the international environment. Respect for the right of peoples to self-determination and independence is not only just? it is also good politics and essential to the attainment and maintenance of world peace. The General Assembly clearly recognized that fact when it adopted the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples way back in December 1960. Yet today  nearly three decades later  colonialism is still very much in evidence. Again  that is a practical reality of our times. The right of peoples to decide their own destiny is being denied not only in the well-publicized cases of southern Africa and the Middle East  especially Palestine  but also in countries in the Pacific  the Caribbean basin and elsewhere. However  the major issue facing the Organization this year is the decolonization of Namibia. That is as it should be. The birth of a new nation is a supreme event in international affairs. And when the United Nations is the appointed intermediary the event becomes even more special to all of us. We ate now entering the horns stretch in the implementation of the Namibian independence plan. Much ground has already been covered and much reference has been made to this phenomenon in speeches we have heard in the last two weeks. But a lot more still remains to be done in the remaining four-and-a-half weeks. Pretoria and its functionaries in Namibia are still refusing fully to comply with Security Council resolution 435 (1978)  the South West Africa Territory (SWATP) command structure has not been disbanded  end we are told that it has only been stood down  the so-called disbandment of Koevoet on 30 September has proved to be illusory  restrictive laws  in particular AG-23  continue to inhibit freedom of assembly and the registration  electoral and constituent Assembly proclamations leave much to be desired. These proclamations were affected only last week  end more information is still being given as to what exactly has been agreed to. Some improvements have been made  some changes have been recorded  and we commend the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) for this  but we need to be vigilant and to ensure that in the next four-and-a-half weeks nothing will be done to reverse the clock. Intimidation of followers of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) by the South-African-sponsored Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) end the South West African Police is regularly reported. In fact  if members read Namibian newspapers they will find they ate full of reports of attacks on SWAPO men and supporters  at times with the police just standing by. UNTAG police units are stretched to the breaking-point we are told  and the assassination of SWAPO leaders has actually taken place.So  while we ate on the home stretch  a grave situation still surrounds events in Namibia  and it is important that we should all keep our guard and remain vigilant. As we enter these final weeks of the election campaign the desperation of the anti-SWAPO forces in Namibia is becoming evident daily. It is important  therefore  that urgent action be taken to strengthen UNTAG police units and to increase the number of projected electoral monitors. We are very pleased that a number of States represented here have agreed and are going to send observers  monitors and guests to Namibia over the next few weeks to observe what will be happening. The more observers  the more guests  the more people we can have in that country  the better. We welcome the effort being made by many States around the globe.Meanwhile  the United Nations must prepare well-thought-out plans for the post-election period in Namibia  assuming the election proceeds satisfactorily. For there can be no doubt that  as the decolonizing authority  the United Nations has a continuing responsibility to see that Namibia's independence is a success. A good mother does not give birth only to abandon the baby immediately. This session of the General Assembly must ensure that the United Nations prepares itself to be a good mother. My delegation is ready to contribute in the process of clarifying the united Nations role during the transition period following the elections and in the elaboration of a continuing United Nations responsibility to ensure that Namibian independence is a success. These are urgent tasks which require our immediate attention. Every effort has been made to draw the attention of the United Nations Secretary-General and of the United Nations generally to these natters  especially the question of convening the Assembly after the elections. Whoever wins the election  it is not yet clear how the Assembly will be convened and how it will proceed to draw up the constitution leading to independence. We would be pleased if the United Nations would remain seized of these problems and would continue to provide solutions until the time of independence itself.In South Africa itself  apartheid  the root cause of all the problems in southern Africa  continues to be firmly entrenched. The state of emergency still continues  Mandela and other political prisoners remain incarcerated j liberation and mass democratic movements ant still proscribedÂ·  the Group Areas Pet and other obnoxious legislative acts continue to be on the apartheid statute books. That is the reality of the situation in South Africa itself.President de Klerk's talk of reform so far remains only mere talk. It is important that the Pretoria regime be urged to go beyond rhetoric to concrete action. The liberation movements are ready to engage President de Klerk in serious negotiations. They have formulated an imaginative negotiating platform which was adopted by the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on Southern Africa  in Harare  on 21 August 1989  as well as by the ninth non-aligned summit conference in Belgrade  It is on the table for South Africa to take advantage of. This is an olive branch from the liberation movement. It outlines a number of confidence-building measures needed before negotiations can begin and sets out the fundamental human rights that should guide the formulation of a new constitutional dispensation for a future South Africa. It is quite obvious of course that negotiations  or any form of dialogue  cannot take place while the leaders are incarcerated in gaols or while the present restrictions emanating from the state of emergency remain. The international community has warmly welcomed this important initiative for peace to which I have just referred  taken by the liberation movement. So far Pretoria has remained mum on this proposal. We are told that certain of the seven leaders who are now incarcerated nay be released sooner or later. That might be a palliative  but what we need is a complete and full constitutional dispensation that can being peaceful conditions in which negotiations can truly take place for the future of an independent South Africa.Until Pretoria dismantles apartheid it is important that the international community intensifies its pressure on it and increases the sanctions against it. There is no secret about the fact that Pretoria is now talking reform is directly related to the impact of international sanctions and the pressure exerted by the liberation forces and other democratic forces in South Africa. There is no doubt whatsoever that sanctions are working and can continue to work. They have damaged the South African economy to a great extent  as has been admitted by the economic spokesmen for that regime. Therefore  more sanctions will certainly put more pressure on the regime. The medicine is slowly taking effect. We appeal to those friends of Pretoria who oppose sanctions to join the rest of the international community in bringing meaningful pressure to bear on Pretoria by applying sanctions and supporting the liberation movement.To the international banking community we say that 1990 will be a critical year for the apartheid regime  because in that year it has to reschedule its debt. Rescheduling the debt is not an automatic right for the racist regime let it be a favour  granted as an inducement to meaningful change in South Africa. The concatenation of events makes the coming rescheduling exercise a particularly potent force for positive political developments in South Africa. We urge the bankers to use it. We have given them adequate information to ensure that they ace quite clear about the choices before then.  Elsewhere in southern Africa  there are regional efforts to bring peace to Angola and to Mozambique. The Assembly has heard statements by the Foreign Ministers of both those countries  elaborating on those measures. We in Zimbabwe appeal to outsiders to stop supporting rebel elements in Mozambique and Angola  especially UNITA in Angola  which has created difficulties in the process of reconciliation. We are seeking African solutions to African problems. The Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations can help as requested and as required  but we ask them to give these initiatives a chance.We also seek peace efforts in the dispute between Mauritania and Senegal  the situation in the Sudan and the situation in Ethiopia. African solutions  initiated by the OAU  are at work in those situations  and we again appeal to outsiders not to interfere in the processes of reconciliation that ate taking place. We are satisfied that the initiatives taken by the Organization of African Unity  if given time to mature  will provide solutions and bring peace to the three areas I have mentioned.We are also anxious to see Western Sahara's independence consolidated with speed and firmness. The Secretary-General's efforts to bring permanent peace to Western Sahara are commended. We also commend the meetings that took place earlier this year between the King of Morocco and the POLISARID Front. We hope these efforts will continue.The denial of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination is a continuing sore in international relations. We deplore the heavy-handed methods of the occupation forces against the aggrieved heroic Palestinian nation. We wish to reiterate our conviction that only an international peace conference under United Nations auspices  with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as an equal partner are addressing all aspects of the Middle East crisis  can bring peace to the region. The proclamation of a Palestinian State last year was an important development in this area. We commended  and commend  the PIO for the step it took  and we are pleased that over 85 countries have recognized the Palestinian State. From that strong position  the Palestinian leadership should be able to proceed to meaningful negotiations with big Powers  small Powers and others in the region that are seized of the problem of Palestine. The independence of Palestine has been long delayed  and we should like to see the Palestinian people take their place as equal citizens alongside the peoples of other nations.In Central America  we welcome the decision to disband the contras and the scheduled elections in Nicaragua  which are to be monitored by the Organization of American States  the United Nations and a host of other international observers. We are pleased that a dialogue has resumed between the Salvadorian Government and the Marti National Liberation Front aimed at bringing peace to El Salvador. We urge flexibility on both sides so that a peaceful solution can be found to their conflict. The only warning we as outsiders would issue regarding the Central American situation again takes the form of urging outsiders not to interfere in the processes that are taking place there. The effort being made by the leaders of Central America to corns together and produce plans that enable them to enjoy self-determination and full human rights and provide peace for their own territories is commendable - if only outsiders do not interfere. In that respect  the main instigator of problems that have arisen in Central America is  of course  the United States  which has continued to fail in troubled waters in Latin America. In Afghanistan  we again urge all outside Powers to stop supplying arms to the opposing sides  and we call upon the Afghan people to negotiate an end to their civil war in a spirit of national reconciliation. We are pleased to note the departure of Soviet troops  and we are also pleased to note the confidence and patriotism that act brought to the Afghan people themselves. We hope that sooner or later they will convene a shura - an assembly - that will make it possible for all Afghans inside and outside Afghanistan to get together to resolve their problems. We believe all Afghans can solve their problems in peace in a shura  their traditional assembly which had met periodically over the past 300 or 400 years.On the question of Kampuchea  we welcome the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and urge the parties concerned to negotiate their differences among themselves in order to arrive at an acceptable solution. We noted with disappointment the failure of the recent Paris Conference. We also noted with disappointment that both the Vietnamese and the Phnom Penh delegations to that Conference refused to accept the international mechanism that was suggested a United Nations peace-keeping force. We have made it clear to them  and we make it clear now  that we do not see any possibility of disarming the rival forces  bringing peace to Cambodia and holding elections there without the active participation of the United Nations. The United Nations has much experience with peace-keeping forces around the world  and  in our view  is the only organization that can assist in the peace-making and peace-keeping process. With regard to the Korean peninsula  it is our view that the Korean people should be left alone to negotiate their reunification without outside interference. We urge that the military manoeuvres by outside forces that often take place on the peninsula or in waters near it be stopped.With regard to Cyprus we appeal again to both parties to co-operate with the Secretary-General in the search for a lasting solution. We commend the meetings that have taken place under the chairmanship of the Secretary-General between the President of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish Cypriots. Again  we call on outside Powers to cease interfering in the internal affairs of Cyprus.In Belgrade the leaders of the non-aligned countries called for self-determination for the remaining colonies of New Caledonia  Malvinas  Diego Garcia  Mayotte and a dozen other territories scattered across the globe. The forty-third session of the General Assembly declared an International Decade for the eradication of the retrograde system of colonialism. We repeat that call from this rostrum.As can be seen from the problems I have just touched upon  we have not yet readied the Promised Land  the new detente notwithstanding. Much remains to be done  and in that the United Nations must play a central role. We therefore welcome the declarations that have be Ï made from this podium by the great Powers  renewing their faith in the United Nations. These days of change also mean a period of uncertainty  a period of opportunities  yet also of danger. In such a period  recourse to and respect for the Organization and its agencies becomes more indispensable than ever before.It was in recognition of that fact  and motivated by the desire to strengthen peace and the rule of law  as well as to bring the age of reason to international relations  that the non-aligned countries convened at The Hague  from 26 to 30 June 1989 a Conference on Pace and the Rule of law in International Affairs. We were pleased by the wide attendance at that Conference  which included important countries not members of our Movement. The Conference was a landmark in the struggle to bring the rule of law and the role of the World Court to the centrality they should enjoy in the resolution of conflicts and in the management of international relations. An important initiative was taken at the Conference to have the General Assembly declare at its current session a decade of international law from 1990 to 1999  leading to a third Hague Peace Conference. That is one of the concrete acts that can be achieved at this session of the General Assembly in the cause of peace  justice and the rule of law. We urge all Member States to support that noble initiative by the non-aligned countries. I am informed that a concrete proposal has already been submitted to the Sixth Committee and that it is now being debated.Last - but by no means least - is the all-important issue of nuclear disarmament  to which I have not referred extensively in my statement. We have all had the opportunity to welcome the signing of the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles - INF Treaty - in 1987. That was a truly significant step in the right direction  but what remains to be achieved is even more formidable. In comparison to that  the INF Treaty is indeed only the tip of the iceberg. The super-Powers have a special responsibility in this regard. As the possessors of the largest arsenals of nuclear  chemical and other weapons of mass destruction  they have a duty to take the lead in the disarmament process.But of course we of the non-aligned movement  as well as the Organization of African Unity  can take some credit for the fact that at the special session of the General Assembly convened last year to discuss the question of disarmament we made our position abundantly clear. We indicated the hazards of war with which the road to disarmament is replete  and we are pleased that our call has been heeded in some quarters.Today the world still has many problems  but in 1989 there is a window of opportunity to address some of them. History will judge us harshly if we miss that opportunity."
