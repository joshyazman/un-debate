"1",22,"AFG",47,1992,"I shall read out the following statementon behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Afghanistan.""Allow me to express my warmest congratulations on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that the work of the Assembly will yield fruitful  indeed radiant  results under your wise guidance  and with the endeavors of the Secretary-General.""It is a source of pleasure for the delegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan to see the new Bulgaria  having renounced communism  taking its place in the international community with new principles and values in line with the true aspirations of the Bulgarian people.“The wise and effective stewardship of your predecessor.Ambassador Samir Shihabi  will always be remembered by those who participated in the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. He were glad to see a record of such high quality placed at the disposal of the General Assembly by a skillful diplomat who represented the brotherly country of Saudi Arabia.""The universality of this Organization has been further strengthened this year by the admission of 13 new Members. He welcome them to this world family and assure them of our cooperation in the realization of the purposes of this Organization.""It is the grace of Almighty Allah that gives me the great honor of conveying this message to the General Assembly for the first time since the establishment of an Islamic State in Afghanistan. ""The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is convened in conditions where the remnants of the cold war and a polarized world are melting  where colonial structures are falling apart and where a new and just order is being forged on our planet.""The 14-year resistance of the heroic Afghan mujahideen  of the liberation movements of nations under tyranny  and of reform movements in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  coupled with the unjust and unrealistic nature of communism and totalitarianism  contributed to the collapse of those systems and consequently to smashing the myth of world-power polarization. This weakened the concept of military pacts and to some extent changed the political map of the world. The years of cold war came to an end and the hope of a new and fair world order emerged. Such positive developments and their subsequent outcomes have given shape to new horizons for the world order  and also to the role of the United Nations in world affairs.""For my delegation  the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly session has two significant features. First  the representatives of the Afghan nation are taking their seat once again in this Organization and  secondly  we are participating in this session with the expectation that the United Nations and other international organizations  as well as international financial institutions and Member States will continue to extend their assistance to the second phase of our struggle:	the	economic reconstruction and social rehabilitation ofour country.""I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to express  on behalf of the people and the Islamic State of Afghanistan  my profound appreciation to all those Member States that firmly stood by our side in condemning the aggression of the former Soviet Union and supported the righteous struggle of the Afghan people for the restoration of the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of Afghanistan  and its non-aligned and Islamic character. Their dynamic political and generous humanitarian support has been a source of encouragement during the entire years of our struggle  in which we have never felt alone  believing that God Almighty and righteousness were on our side.""In this respect  our special heartfelt thanks and gratitude is extended to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan  the Islamic Republic of Iran  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Arab Republic of Egypt. We will always remember the strong political and generous humanitarian assistance of the United States of America  the People's Republic of China  the United Kingdom  Western European countries and Japan.""We thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations  his Special Representative and the Office of the Coordinator for United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance programs Relating to Afghanistan (UNOCA) for playing a conciliatory role for bringing peace to Afghanistan  as well as channeling assistance to our people.""We would expect that this Organization may continue to assist Afghanistan in the realization of the noble aspirations of our people.""Speaking for the first time after the establishment of the Islamic State of Afghanistan  I deem it necessary to make a brief reference to a matter that concerns the circumstances that culminated in the collapse of the previous regime and the establishment of an Islamic State in the country.""The understanding reached between the leaders and commanders of Jihad with the regular and irregular forces of the previous Government in the country contributed to a smooth and peaceful transition of power from that Government to the newly established Islamic Government of Afghanistan on 28 April 1992  avoiding  perhaps  a blood-bath in the capital.""Based upon the high objective of avoiding further loss of life and bloodshed  the newly established Islamic State has tried to solve existing political problems  which are the legacy of the 14 years of war and destruction in the country  through peaceful means of dialog  negotiations  tolerance and understanding  thus preparing the ground for holding free and fair elections as a viable procedure of guaranteeing democracy and social justice.""It should be obvious that holding a general election in a country requires  first and foremost  an atmosphere of complete peace and security. Unfortunately  the recent irresponsible non-stop three-week rocket attacks on Kabul resulted in the tragic loss of some 2 400 innocent people  as well as 9 000 injuries. These senseless attacks have also seriously disturbed the speedy and final resolution of the present political problems. This situation  as well as the ongoing program of repatriation of refugees and that of the resettlement of displaced people  as well as the lack of adequate security and financial resources  and facilities that are essential requirements for holding a general election  brought the Government to the point of taking a preliminary step  which would prepare the ground for the holding of a free and fair election. This first step is the convening of a traditional Loya Kirgah""a Grand Council  a Council of Representatives:	in	other words  aShura-i-Ahli-Hal-wa-Aqd  a term used for the same gathering  in Arabic ""comprising the representatives of the people of Afghanistan. This assembly is to be held at the earliest convenience  probably within the next two months. ""During the past month  some assemblies have been convened in different parts of Afghanistan to deliberate on the present political situation in the country. On 8 September 1992  an assembly consisting of 2 500 Jihad commanders  heads of tribes  ulama"" religious scholars ""and influential Afghan personalities representing 16 of the 29 provinces of Afghanistan was held in the city of Ghazni  somewhere near Central Afghanistan. After discussing various issues pertaining to security conditions  the political situation and basic needs in the provinces  and especially in Kabul  the assembly made a request to the Government to call a Loya Jirgah  which would be the best and shortest path for resolving the present crisis. Their deliberations call for convening  by the end of October  a Shoura  that is  a Jirgah or a Council  of all segments of Afghan society  including Afghan refugees living abroad.""On 12 September 1992  another assembly was convened  in the city of Kandahar. In this gathering. Jihad commanders and heads of several tribes of southern and southwestern Afghanistan called for the convening of a Loya Jirgah. It is noteworthy that the participants in this assembly  among other things  requested the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations jointly to supervise the convening of such a grand assembly.""In addition to the above-mentioned assemblies  there have been a number of other gatherings throughout Afghanistan that have asked the Islamic State to convene a Loya Jirgah as the only authoritative platform to decide on the political future of the country.""The position of the Islamic State of Afghanistan  which reflects the righteous demands and suggestions of the valiant people of Afghanistan  obligates it to ensure that all ways and means and are utilized in seeing that this wish of the nation  echoed through the convening of various assemblies  is heeded.""The safeguarding of the unity  sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Afghanistan could only be ensured if the will of the nation  which is the source of sovereignty  is expressed. Such aspirations  under prevailing conditions  could be reflected through the convening of a Loya Jirgah  which in the absence of the possibilities of holding elections is the only authoritative and inclusive body to determine the political destiny of the country.""The Islamic State of Afghanistan is exerting every effort to bring about appropriate safeguards and guarantees for facilitating the speedy transition of power to an elected government through Loya Jirgah.However  for the purpose of ensuring appropriate safeguards and guarantees  the Islamic State of Afghanistan  if necessary  may request the United Nations and the Organization of the Islamic Conference to supervise the proceedings of such an assembly.""Our struggle has been victorious because of the 14 years of continuous  valiant and dedicated sacrifices made by our Muslim nation against a super-Power and its supporters. This victory is a brilliant milestone and turning-point in our history. But the price of victory has been very high.""To portray the extent of death and destruction in Afghanistan  it is perhaps sufficient to quote the first paragraph of the 'Consolidated Appeal by the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Emergency Humanitarian Assistance for Afghanistan'  which says:	'Few countries inhistory have suffered to the extent Afghanistan has over the past 14 years. Aside from the physical destruction  which was often nothing short of cataclysmic  the results of the war include over 1 million people killed  over 2 million disabled  nearly 6 million refugees in neighboring countries and 2 million internally displaced persons'.""The total destruction of most of the villages and towns has been estimated at 200.000 hectares of forest. 8.000 water arteries. 6 million cattle.114 medical centers. 2.700 kilometers of main roads and more than 2 000 school buildings. Almost all our power stations and communications systems have been either totally destroyed or very badly damaged. The real estimate of losses is to be reckoned. There are about 10 million mines implanted by the Soviet occupying forces all over Afghanistan. Perhaps the coming Afghan generations may not be able to walk without fear on their own soil. And this is the saddest part of it.""The completion of the repatriation program is directly related to de-mining. According to United Nations reports  in recent months there have been many returnees who were killed or injured by the mines. Medical clinics in the border town of Peshawar in Pakistan are overcrowded with the mine-affected returnees. In this respect  we call upon the international community to respond positively to the appeal of the Secretary-General in supporting financially the related projects ofthe United Nations.""While the international community is celebrating the end of the Decade of Disabled Persons  there are 2 million people who fall into the same category in my country  and their destitute and meager existence deserves special attention.""Our problems are so great that we  with our limited capabilities  cannot address the critical needs of disabled persons. The Islamic State of Afghanistan  with its war-shattered economy as one element affecting its rehabilitation programs  has prioritized the construction of new hospitals and clinics which need to be financed by international assistance programs.""The efforts of this Organization in adopting principles for the purpose of ensuring the implementation of measures and a monitoring system for the rights of disabled persons is commendable. However  the problem in my country is of a different nature. We have to create appropriate national machinery to support almost 2 million disabled persons  victims of armed conflict. Without appropriate international assistance  that objective cannot be achieved.""As for the orphans of war  if we estimate that each Afghan killed in the 14 years of war had one child  there are 1.5 million orphans in Afghanistan. Because of that great number  the Islamic State of Afghanistan is in critical need of international assistance for the rehabilitation of orphans of war.""In appreciation of the severity of the problems of orphans of war and armed conflicts and their deserving of particular international attention  my delegation proposes the establishment of a special fund in the framework of the United Rations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for the rehabilitation of orphans as a result of armed conflicts  wherever they are and to whatever country they belong. In this regard  it may also be appropriate to declare the year 1994 the international year of the orphan.""There can be no political stability in any country without economic viability. The Islamic State of Afghanistan has inherited a country that is physically devastated  psychologically battered  economically depleted  and politically and socially tormented; the population is in dire need of moral and material support. The Islamic State was established as a result of immeasurable sacrifices and the great suffering that the Afghan nation has endured for the sake of its freedom and its conviction to its faith. Our people's struggle has had international significance in general and has had wide-ranging impact on the promotion of freedom and the emergence of new States. Without a sound economy  the peace that has been achieved at such a terrible cost cannot be guaranteed  and instability in Afghanistan is sure to affect the region.""The war has destroyed the economic infrastructure of Afghanistan. Rebuilding the country's economic structure is crucial for the future existence of Afghanistan as a productive and self-supporting member of the world community. Comprehensive and methodical economic programs  with the assistance of friendly countries and the United Nations  will ensure the reconstruction process  a solid foundation upon which future economic progress can be built.""At the. moment  however  the issue of emergency humanitarian relief efforts takes priority because of the obvious food shortages  lack of clean water and electricity and inadequate medical care  which are threatening the survival of the nation as a whole and the capital in particular. Unfortunately/ the Islamic State of Afghanistan has not received adequate support from the international community in this regard.""The United Nations Special Representative on Afghanistan recently expressed dismay at the lack of enthusiasm on the part of the international community in responding urgently to meet the $180 million target of assistance proposed by Bis Excellency the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his appeal of 5 June 1992. So far  almost $40.5 million has been received in response to that appeal. The positive response of some countries is greatly appreciated by the Islamic State of Afghanistan.“Aside from the human calamities  in the first week of September of this year a natural disaster hit Gulbahar and other neighboring towns of Parwan Province of Afghanistan. That flood was of a severity unmatched for many decades. According to reliable reports  about 3 000 people were killed  and hundreds of houses were totally demolished. It is astonishing that international authorities have not addressed their attention to that large-scale calamity. He are requesting the international community to provide emergency humanitarian assistance for the flood victims and their families.“The Islamic State of Afghanistan wishes to solicit the support of United Nations Member States in ensuring due consideration of item 141 of the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly  entitled 'Emergency international assistance for the reconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan'- It is our sincere and earnest hope that Member States will consider extending their full support to the two separate draft resolutions that are to be submitted by the delegation of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on agenda item 141. ""The Islamic State of Afghanistan is of the opinion that  in spite of many positive changes in international relations  some of the main objectives of the United Nations  such as total disarmament - especially with respect to nuclear arms settlement of conflicts through peaceful means  the observance of human rights and the establishment of a new and just international economic order  have not been fully realized. Perhaps it would be more in line with the aim of realizing the purposes of this Organization for the positive new climate of international understanding to be utilized for the purpose of strengthening the role of the United Nations in bolstering the socio-economic advancement of the developing countries  especially the least developed ones. The willingness of the developed countries to ensure greater cooperation with the needy countries could contribute positively to the realization of this objective.""The Islamic State of Afghanistan holds the conviction that the multidimensional problem of the environment already threatens the future of our world. At the recent summit of Heads of State or Government in Rio de Janeiro  this global problem was discussed extensively  and a credible document entitled Agenda 21 was adopted  providing a sound basis for solving global environmental issues.""It is promising to see that dependence on ideology in the settlement of regional conflicts is vanishing and a tendency is emerging in favor of strengthening international cooperation for the settlement of existing conflicts.""The Islamic State of Afghanistan will work for international peace in full cooperation with the United Nations and stand by and respect the United Nations Charter  the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and all accepted norms of this world body. In the arena of international relations  the Islamic State of Afghanistan  as one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement  will continue to pursue an active non-aligned policy  free judgment on international issues  sincerely supporting the objectives of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  strengthening friendly ties with all countries on the basis of parity and mutual respect for independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's affairs. The Islamic State of Afghanistan pledges sincere adherence to all international agreements  stands against every form of colonialism and all racial ideas  supports the elimination of nuclear weapons and will help in erasing international and regional tensions.""The Islamic State of Afghanistan welcomes the current negotiations between the concerned parties in the Middle East and hopes that they will result in the realization of the legitimate right of the people of Palestine to establish their own independent State. Without an immediate halt to Israeli settlement in the occupied territories  there can be no firm assurance that those negotiations will lead to permanent peace and stability in that region. Afghanistan  in conformity with the principle of the right to self-determination and in compliance with the resolution of the Islamic Conference of Istanbul  supports the rights of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and asks for an immediate halt to the massacre of the innocent population of that Republic. We denounce the heinous policy of 'ethnic cleansing'  which  in spite of world-wide condemnation  is still taking place. Afghanistan  as one of the sponsors of draft resolution A/46/L.76 of the resumed forty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  advocates decisive action  under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  aimed at ensuring the rights of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to self-defense and to the protection of their territorial integrity and sovereignty. ""While supporting the right of all people to self-determination  the delegation from the Islamic State of Afghanistan believes that the question of Kashmir should be settled through negotiations and dialog on the basis of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations.""The Islamic State of Afghanistan  while desiring friendly relations with all countries  attributes special importance to its relations with the neighboring countries Pakistan and Iran  as well as with the fraternal country of Saudi Arabia.""We have a sincere desire to maintain and strengthen our traditional friendship with the United States of America. Afghanistan seeks friendly relations with Japan and with Western European and other Far East countries.""The Islamic State of Afghanistan aspires to positive and friendly relations with the new Muslim Republics of Central Asia and wishes to strengthen its commercial  economic and cultural ties with those republics.""The Islamic State of Afghanistan also wishes for friendly relations with non-aligned India and hopes that India will cooperate with the people of Afghanistan in the needed areas.""Our country desires close and friendly relations with the People's Republic of China and hopes that technical cooperation and trade with that neighbor will be expanded.""Afghanistan wishes for the improvement of friendly relations with the Russian Federation and expects that the Russian Federation will participate fully in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan. The Russian Federation  as the inheritor of the former Soviet Union  has the responsibility to compensate for the destruction caused by armed aggression of the former Soviet Union against Afghanistan.""It is also necessary to express our concern for the suffering families of more than 30 000 Afghans still missing after the years of the former Soviet Union's aggression in our country. This tragedy has seriously affected the sentiments of all Afghans  and they expect that the Commonwealth of Independent States will address this issue urgently and seriously. Believing that a sincere desire based upon goodwill and mutual trust between the parties concerned could positively contribute to resolving this important humanitarian issue  the Islamic State of Afghanistan will try to use bilateral channels as a first step towards resolving this issue  unless circumstances require otherwise.""In closing  I deem it necessary to point out that the United Nations  which plays an increasingly important role in the settlement of regional conflicts and world problems  should increasingly focus its activities on overcoming global problems and difficulties. As a Member of the United Nations  the Islamic State of Afghanistan is prepared to extend its full cooperation to the Organization in overcoming the world's existing difficulties and will spare no effort in implementing the resolutions and decisions of the present session.""May Allah Glory Be Unto Him bestow ever greater successes to all participants of this current session of the Assembly."""
"2",61,"AGO",47,1992,"Allow me  first of all  on behalf of the Angolan Government and on my own behalf  to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session and to wish you success in carrying out your mandate. I am sure that your experience and competence will guarantee the success of our work. The Angolan delegation wishes from the outset to assure you of our complete cooperation. To the outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi  I should like to express my appreciation for the valuable work done during his mandate. To Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  I express my Government's profound appreciation of his goodwill and selfless efforts  demonstrated in the constant search for just and lasting solutions aimed at preserving peace and international security. My Government supports and will contribute in a positive way to the realization of the valuable concepts formulated in his report ""An Agenda for Peace""  whose sub-heading includes the words ""Preventive diplomacy"" (A/47/277). On behalf of the Government and people of Angola  I wish to welcome the new States that have been admitted to the United Nations; we are certain that their participation will contribute to the Organization's betterment. The world has witnessed important political transformations occurring in Angola in the past. The armed conflict that had ravaged the country since 1975 was ended with the signing of the Bicesse Accords on 31 May 1992. There  83 is no occasion more appropriate than the present one to sum up the situation which has followed the peace accords. The Angolan people is preparing for and awaiting with great expectations the holding of the first multiparty general elections on 29 and 30 September  which demonstrate my Government's determination to comply with the obligations it has assumed under the Bicesse Accords. While the incidents taking place in my country represent transitional occurrences in a process as complex as ours  their recurrence in almost all parts of the country is a source of grave concern to my Government and to the Angolan people. In this regard my Government believes that the United Nations and the rest of the international community have an important role to play during this decisive phase of the Angolan peace process. The environment of peace and relative tranquillity that prevails in my country is the result of persistent and arduous work and of the tenacious will of the Angolan people  which counted upon the international community. The Angolan people has provided proof of civilian rule and political maturity by spontaneously and massively participating in electoral registration and in all the activities which will bring about the elections in spite of the difficulty in communications. Of the estimated number of slightly more than 5 million voters  4.8 million have registered. The national electoral council has demonstrated foresight and has performed its work with praiseworthy efficiency. And from this podium  I wish to express once more Angola's appreciation to all those countries and organizations which lent us their support in so many forms. My Government sincerely hopes that before the election definitive accords can be reached on certain aspects which continue to be a source of concern with regard to the conduct of free and fair elections at the end of this  84-85 month. I am speaking  in particular  of the disbanding of the present governmental armed forces and the military wing of UNITA  of the cessation of the wave of violence and intimidation provoked by the Government's co-signatory to the Bicesse Accords and of the formation of a national army. The process of peace and democratization under way in my country  to which I have previously referred as a historic event in the life of Angola  cannot but have positive repercussions and effects in the international sphere. Associated with this is another factor of profound significance for the southern region of our continent. I am referring to the negotiations being conducted in South Africa within the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA)  which Angola considers the most appropriate means to find a fair  lasting and satisfactory solution for all the parties involved. As a result  Angola supports and shares the African position that CODESA should achieve concrete objectives  such as the establishment of a transitional government and the creation of mechanisms for elaborating a constitution for a democratic South Africa and for holding free elections based on the principle of ""one person  one vote"".  86 I should like also to make reference to the situation in Mozambique and in other parts of the African continent. The Angolan people stand in solidarity with our brethren in Mozambique. For that reason  my Government encourages the Government of Mozambique to persevere in its peace effort for the country and urges the international community to give its assistance to the parties involved with a view to achieving peace and national reconciliation. Another question that still worries us is the unjust situation that persists in East Timor. The position of the Angolan Government is well known by all; we continue to defend the principle of direct negotiations between Portugal  as the administering Power  and Indonesia  without excluding the presence of the legitimate representatives of the Maubere people  so that a comprehensive solution can be found  taking into consideration the aspirations of the Maubere people. In this context  we express our wish that the next meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and Portugal  under the auspices of the Secretary-General  will produce positive results. In relation to Western Sahara  my Government supports the holding of a referendum in that Territory and sincerely hopes that the obstacles that still exist will be removed as soon as possible. Angola looks with concern to the situation which prevails in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  where the short-term outlook for reaching a lasting peace is poor  and where the lives of innocent people are being taken. In relation to the Middle East  the Angolan Government has always favoured holding an international conference to reach a comprehensive solution on the Middle East  in particular the Palestinian question. Therefore  we support the rounds of negotiations that are taking place; we hope that although there are many obstacles to overcome  the concerted efforts and the good will of the parties will bring positive results and that the tragedy of the Palestinian people will finally end. A fact which cannot but bring us satisfaction and which has our total support and encouragement is the holding of direct negotiations between Israel and the other parties concerned on the occupied Arab territories. We hope that those negotiations will yield fully satisfactory results for the parties participating in the negotiations  and that peace will finally be restored in the region. In our view  whatever measure is taken  or whatever solution is advised  will never be satisfactory or lasting unless it takes into account and is based upon the true interests and concerns of the peoples involved. The great changes that have recently taken place in the international arena have in a certain way dictated the necessity of providing our Organization with greater dynamism in taking decisions and greater efficiency in implementing and monitoring them. The increase in the membership of the Organization  while strengthening it numerically  has also created the need for greater participation  on an equitable basis  in the various agencies of the United Nations system which bear mandates of fundamental importance in resolving the affairs of mankind with respect to problems of peace  international security  development and environmental protection.  88 We hope that the work under way for the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations will take our needs into consideration. Angola considers such restructuring to be opportune provided it is directed towards eliminating mechanisms for taking action that are outdated or are no longer attuned to the present reality  and provided that the restructuring has as its fundamental objective the strengthening of the role of the Organization to the benefit of all mankind. In recent decades the world economic situation has swung widely in various corners of the planet. But the general trend has been towards polarization. As a result  while we observe an increase in economic growth for the developed countries  we note a substantial decrease in growth for developing countries. The situation in some cases is critical. The second Conference of the Least Developed Countries  held at Paris in September 1990  concluded that the economic and social situation of those countries as a whole has deteriorated over the past decade  since  with very rare cases of better performance  the average annual growth rate was 2.2 per cent. In many cases the rates were negative. Faced with this sad reality  the Conference set forth a new programme of action for the present decade which provides for national and international measures in favour of these countries and indicates the basic principles which must orient relations between those countries and other countries and organizations which cooperate with them for development. In each case  effective implementation of that programme will require serious and profound reflection  and commensurate action.  89 With the end of the cold war  a new era has begun in which decisions on matters of world interest are dealt with more and more on the basis of consultation and understanding  instead of confrontation and competition. This has rapidly transformed isolated cases of integration into a general trend  with countries in various regions organizing themselves into more closely aligned economic and political entities. This trend towards the formation of larger economic blocs will inevitably transform the world economically and politically. This poses a challenge for which we must be duly prepared in order to avoid deepening still further the gap that separates rich countries from poor countries. It is a challenge with respect to which all of us  rich countries and poor  large countries and small  must make a commensurate collective effort to maintain effective  multifarious international cooperation directed always towards the development of the parties involved  based always upon the true needs of the development process. However  certain political situations are now viewed as faits accomplis. or as conditions to be perpetuated. These must be the object of immediate and radical revision  with a view to harmonizing positions and interests  and weakening wide barriers that impede true cooperation between countries and nations separated by vast differences in their levels of economic  social  scientific  technical  cultural and educational development. In our view  this revision should consist  inter alia  of the following elements: abolition of protectionist measures by developed countries that block or impede access to their markets for products from underdeveloped  90 countries  or their limitation to those that are strictly necessary; total or partial cancellation by the developed countries of the underdeveloped countries' external debt; in the granting of loans or credits  the imposition of no further conditions with respect to concomitant  mandatory adoption of political measures that are not always in keeping with the level of development of the beneficiary country; concessions or an increase in grace periods  and rescheduling of payment; a reduction of interest rates and the non-capitalization of interest; favouring of investments in nationally defined areas  with particular emphasis on industrial development; and transformation of technology and its application to development. Those are some of the basic aspects around which the strategy of international economic cooperation must revolve if we intend  as is our duty  to eliminate the poverty in which the majority of the inhabitants of our planet languish. Poverty grows daily  especially in our African continent. It is worsened by natural calamities that exacerbate the present grave economic and social situation in Africa.  91 Angola is a country with many natural resources. It exports petroleum  diamonds  coffee and other products  and with the advent of peace we intend to diversify fully our export products  in this manner participating more effectively in the division of international labour. However  we are concerned by the exaggerated protectionist measures practised by developed countries in international trade  which are manifest in the unprecedented drop in the prices of raw materials and in the deterioration of the terms of trade  as well as the lack of success in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiation rounds. As a third world country  and with the objective of correcting the distortion in its economy  Angola reformulated its socio-political situation with measures which will necessarily have positive effects on the economic life of the country and which are consonant with this new situation. We recently adopted a Government programme of action designed to decentralize the economy  liberalize trade  revitalize business  democratize the banking sector and encourage foreign investment. In this manner  we believe that adequately carrying out this programme in response to these new conditions will permit us  as is our desire  to participate actively in international economic cooperative efforts  making our contribution  to the extent possible  to the socio-economic development of Africa and the world. Allow me to express here my country's profound interest in the need to protect the environment. The Rio Conference  held in June this year  not only constituted a means for an interesting exchange of experiences and viewpoints concerning a most important programme but also provided a moment for reflection on the continuing need for coordinated efforts for the benefit of  92 all mankind. Most certainly  the Conference allowed us to see clearly that  given current trends in scientific and technical development  any brash misstep detrimental to the environment could lead to the destruction of our planet. I wish for this reason to reaffirm here my country's commitment to observe and fully apply the decisions of the Conference and to express our readiness to engage in unrestricted cooperation with the international community in undertaking all necessary steps so that we  together  can save the Earth. "
"3",108,"ALB",47,1992,"It is an honour and a particular pleasure for me  on behalf of the Albanian delegation and the Albanian people  to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you  Sir  upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. It is a tribute to your personal accomplishments  an honour to your country  and an expression of the qualitatively new role that countries in transition are playing in the international arena. I believe that the current session  under your presidency  will successfully attain its goals  which are the goals of the international community at large. I should like to assure you of the support of the Albanian delegation in the Assembly's work during this session. I take this opportunity to convey my thanks and express my highest consideration to your predecessor  Mr. Samir S. Shihabi  for the admirable way in which he presided over the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. Allow me also to extend my greetings to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his commendable role at the head of the world Organization  for his contribution to the strengthening of the spirit of cooperation  and especially for his personal contribution to solving various problems in different hotbeds of tension in the world of today.  29 My special greetings go also to the 20 newly admitted Members of the Organization  which are going to play their part in upholding the common values of the new society that is taking shape. Their accession to membership of this world body has enriched the universal character of the United Nations. The Republic of Albania has strongly supported their membership  believing that it will further promote the peace process and strengthen the democratic way of development. Since the last session of the General Assembly we have witnessed a number of significant events which followed the cold war and which will have an effect on the future of mankind. The fundamental values of the post-cold-war era are being established. Confrontation between the blocs  and the attendant political tension  has been supplanted by the universal values of democracy and equality in international relations  which are interdependent in terms of the economic and social development and security of every country. This has been confirmed. Today  the aspirations of the peoples towards self-determination and their striving to establish their national identity  which had been marred under communism  as well as their thirst for democracy and equality  have become the driving forces of the situations we are faced with today. Nationalism is not a product of democracy. Nationalism is the affirmation of national identity which  only afterwards  will work towards integration. The blows dealt by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to the paralytic system of some years ago are today translating euphoria into onerous efforts to overcome a very difficult period of trial and transition. The year that has passed has strengthened the tendency towards political union and has witnessed the victory of the basic principles of respect for human rights  democracy  the rule of law and the move towards the market economy system.  30 The contribution of the United Nations and in particular of the Security Council to these ends since the last session of the General Assembly has been remarkable. In seeking to add a human dimension to the delicate balances to be struck  the United Nations is shouldering historic responsibilities. The political vector of its activities is aimed precisely at promoting those principles and thus at creating a common political psychology of thought and action. Unity in diversity that is  the realization of one's national interests in the overall equation of world development is undoubtedly the foundation and the raison d'etre of the Organization; it is the very embodiment of the predominance of peaceful reasoning over passionate action and the preservation of the very delicate balance between the two. The resolutions of the Security Council  especially the one imposing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro; the Middle East peace talks that are increasing the chances of finding a solution; the talks on resolving the conflict between the communities in Cyprus  as well as other activities  all reaffirm the universality of the Organization and the overall impact of its unique and inalienable role  which is the universal yardstick in measuring compliance with implementation of the principles of international law and tacit norms of world civilization.  31 In this context  Albania welcomes the recent contribution of the Secretary-General in the form of his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" as a comprehensive approach to the challenges of the world of today and of the Organization. This session of the General Assembly gives Albania the opportunity to proclaim from this rostrum the remarkable victory scored by the democratic anti-communist forces in my country in the general parliamentary elections of 22 May 1992 and in the local elections of 26 July. Those events finally determined the course upon which Albania has embarked and which it is persistently pursuing. Those events laid the foundations  in Albania  of the rule of law which is becoming institutionalized. They marked the beginning of our first epoch of non-communist  democratic governments  the first of which is implementing a very profound reform as the only course towards the overall transformation and development of the political  economic  social and other fields  at the level of the individual and of society as a whole. My Government's main goal is to establish the legal framework needed to facilitate that reform in order to harmonize the integration of the Albanian economy with the world economy  in order to eradicate the disastrous consequences of isolation and to overcome the economic collapse which the Government inherited from many years of totalitarianism. That  however  is not all the Government inherited. It also inherited active human resources inclined to change  human beings full of potential who are endeavouring to follow the models of the new system  people who  for no fault of their own  lack experience. These are the people who are working to shape the new Albanian society  and to do so they have turned to international political life to find remedies against impatience. In this context  the  32 involvement of various United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the World Health Organization (WHO)  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  already active in the country  is a valuable contribution to democracy in Albania. I would single out in particular the remarkable contribution of the IMF in working out the programme of economic reform that is being implemented. Albania is faced with a very challenging economic crisis resulting from the total failure of the centralized economy which it inherited and from the inevitable difficulties of transition itself. At present  Albania is living on the emergency humanitarian aid offered by the European Community and the Italian Government on the one hand  and on the modest contribution of the growing private sector on the other. The Albanian economy  in this initial phase of recovery  badly needs financial support  substantial investments and raw materials to invigorate industry and employ the large work force  one of the youngest in Europe. Everything cannot of course be done overnight; hence the difficulties of transition. Understanding  support and assistance on the part of the international community are the sole guarantees of improvement of the situation in Albania and of the success of the reform. In that process  Albania is trying to develop its economy against a background of environmental safety. We are fully aware of the possible consequences of neglect  and equally aware of what we have inherited as a result of underdevelopment in this regard. We look forward to benefiting from the relevant experience which the United Nations has to offer. In this context  we welcome the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held earlier this year in Rio.  33 Under those conditions  Albanian foreign policy has also acquired a new dimension and orientation. Concrete proof of its new orientation is the establishment of diplomatic relations with a number of countries such as Estonia  Lithuania  Saudi Arabia  Slovenia  Croatia  the United Arab Emirates  Paraguay and Qatar; the active participation of Albanian delegations in various activities such as the Black Sea initiative and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). In the course of this year  the Republic of Albania has joined the International Fund for Agricultural Development and has adhered to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol on the status of refugees. The situation in my country is unfolding against a very tense and perilous background in the Balkans. In some parts of the region  unfortunately  the practices being carried out go against the general political orientation and acceptable norms of behaviour of a civilized society. All-out war has been going on in the former Yugoslavia for more than a year now. The persistent efforts of the international community have been stubbornly flouted by malicious proponents of Serbian nationalism in its unprecedented affront to civilization and the norms of common democratic life. For more than a year now  a number of international organizations have been directly seized of that crisis  which is ravaging more human lives by the day. The United Nations  the CSCE and the European Community  among others  have been forced to consider stern measures to counter that uncivilized challenge. The war  however  is still going on. Albania  a neighbouring country in that region  is suffering the consequences of regional insecurity. Moreover  my country  situated as it is beside that region  is living under the constant threat and real danger of a  34 spill-over of the conflict into Kosovo. That threat is even greater if we take into account the continuing repression of the third group of peoples of the former Yugoslavia  the anti-constitutional amendments there  the laws governing special circumstances  and the complete and total paralysis of institutional life. The danger becomes alarming if we take into account the cruel refusal by the Belgrade authorities to allow the exercise of institutional power by the Albanians of Kosovo  who are peacefully and democratically organized  in conformity with all the norms of international law. Kosovo is one of the most delicate issues of the Yugoslav crisis. The conflict there is a highly political one  a conflict deriving from the impossibility of coexistence with the occupier. It is a conflict between the peaceful exercise of the principle of self-determination and blatant hegemonistic refusal to allow that exercise. Consequently  the situation remains explosive. That is also the conclusion of a number of missions of the European Community and the CSCE which have visited Kosovo. The international community  fully aware and desirous of avoiding violence  is seized of the situation. The Albanian delegation  however  cannot but notice that preventive diplomacy has not as yet yielded the desired results. The legitimate leaders of Kosovo  on their part  although determined to pursue the road of unconditional political dialogue to which the CSCE Helsinki summit gave its blessing  and which was refused by the authorities in Belgrade  are finding it more and more difficult to keep the agitation of their people under control. The sacred principles of the United Nations Charter  the Helsinki Final Act and other fundamental documents of world political life apply equally to the Albanian people of Kosovo. Principles cannot be selectively applicable.  35 The Albanian side has  for a long time now  voiced its concern and called on the international community to concert its efforts towards finding a just and lasting solution that would be acceptable to the parties involved. The Yugoslav crisis is a complex one. As such  it has been considered by a number of international bodies. The London Conference  the most recent initiative  has set itself the task of finding an overall solution. Albania appreciates and endorses the praiseworthy contribution rendered by the United Nations in trying to solve the crisis over the last year  especially now  as Co-Chairman of that Conference  which we believe will be able to ensure the political commitment of all parties. Albania is participating in that Conference in order to make its contribution to its proceedings  particularly as regards the question of Kosovo. And in those endeavours  it will continue to advocate the finding of an acceptable solution. In our view  the Yugoslav crisis is the crisis of peoples who cannot live under Serbian hegemony any longer; it is not a constitutional crisis or a crisis among republics only. Accordingly  a solution will entail broader direct participation. It will entail the full participation of the legitimately mandated representatives of Kosovo when their future is being discussed. It will entail international mediation. That is the only way to control the various factions which are seeking to obstruct the way to peace. The Republic of Albania trusts that the United Nations  with its valuable contribution  will ensure the triumph of reason over passions  and will adopt the measures necessary to enforce the implementation of its decisions and to stand forcefully against the policy of fait accompli.  36 The social model to come embodies the loftiest standards of respect for the human being. The new world order  based on security  understanding and cooperation  is the guarantee that current structures will be strengthened and further developed. All of us must contribute to strengthening this edifice. The United Nations will continue to provide us with a framework in which peoples can count on good will and mutuality. "
"4",176,"ARE",47,1992,"It gives me great pleasure  on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  to extend to you. Sir  sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that your vast experience in the area of international relations will enhance the role of the Organization and promote its goals. (Mr. Al-Nuaimi. United Arab Emirates!He wish to express our gratitude for  and our deep appreciation of the tireless efforts of your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  during his tenure as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session  which was characterized by many constructive achievements.This session represents a historic turning-point in the enhancement of the universality of the United Nations. Hence  we believe that the admission of the new States Members will strengthen the role of the Organization  especially in the current international situation  and we reiterate our commitment to cooperation with all States in maintaining international peace and security.I take this occasion to reaffirm our confidence in and our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to contain existing problems and to find peaceful solutions thereto within the context of a strengthened role for the Organization in consolidating the basis of international peace and security.As we approach the beginning of a new century  the United Nations passes through a very delicate phase that will have far-reaching effects on the nature and course of international relations. One of the most outstanding features of that phase is the disappearance of bipolarity and its attendant phenomena. This is a development that ushers in a new era whose principal characteristic is that most countries of the world  particularly the major Powers  now resort to the United Nations  thus strengthening the Organization and enhancing the effectiveness of the role envisioned for it by the Charter. Consequently  the Organization has become the appropriate forum for resolving regional conflicts and maintaining international peace and security.Over the past few years  the world has been witnessing the emergence of a new world order after which every nation has been aspiring. We in the United Arab Emirates welcome this development and consider that it is positive in its basis  substance and goals  as  in our view  it will promote cooperation towards the building of a better future of respect for the rights of nations and equality between States  freedom and independence for all peoples and the peaceful settlement of disputes.My country  proceeding from its traditions  cultural values and history  firmly believes in the United Nations Charter. We also support the organs of the United Nations as well as the peaceful means prescribed in the Charter for the settlement of inter-State disputes  and reject violence as a means of settling such disputes.In spite of the optimism created by the recent changes in the world and the constructive role played by the United Nations in creating an environment of peace  there is still a number of problems that endanger international peace and security and require a great deal of hard work. Moreover  the new spirit of detente that pervades world politics does not mean necessarily that we now live in a world of absolute harmony. The security of small nations is still threatened  in the still existing maelstrom of regional conflicts  by the dangers arising from the ambitions of those States that still seek hegemony and expansion at the expense of their neighbors. This  of course  contravenes the principles of the United Nations Charter  undermines the rule of international law and runs counter to the desire of the international community to live in peace and to resolve disputes by dialog  peacefully. Consequently  we must take the appropriate collective measures that are capable of preventing those who wish to create situations that threaten international peace and security from perpetrating such actions. Such an undertaking on our part would be compatible with the new international realities especially now when we are on the verge of turning a new leaf and ushering in a new era of international relations based on peaceful coexistence and mutual respect. One of the most important lessons history has been teaching us since the Second World War is that aggression does not pay and that we must forswear the use of force to achieve political expansionist goals. It is indeed the responsibility of the United Nations to focus attention on this lesson and to translate it into concrete action through the exercise of a collective will that is capable of deterring aggression and warding off the grave dangers which threaten international peace and security.Over the past few years  the Gulf region has witnessed grave events  from the Iran-Iraq war to the Iraqi aggression against the sisterly State of Kuwait. These events had deleterious effects on the region's security  economic  social and environmental conditions. Because of those events and the changes in the world situation which have arisen from the end of bipolarity and the emerging features of a new world order based on understanding  dialog  the maintenance of security and stability  peaceful coexistence  and the peaceful settlement of regional disputes  we have been trying  together with our sister States  members of the Gulf Cooperation Council  to translate those new concepts into rules and principles that would govern the relations and ties of the States of the region.While we have been taking substantial strides along this peaceful constructive path towards restoring stability and security to our region  and  in the context of this effort  have been trying to initiate dialog with the Islamic Republic of Iran to settle the outstanding issues between our two countries  especially the Iranian military occupation of the three Arab islands that belong to the United Arab Emirates  namely Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Mousa  the Iranian authorities have embarked upon the adoption of a number of unlawful measures with regard to the island of Abu Mousa in violation of the Memorandum of Understanding concluded in 1971.My country has declared its rejection of these measures since they are in flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the United Arab Emirates. They also run counter to the principle of good-neighborliness and contravene the letter and spirit of the Memorandum ofUnderstanding  which  in effect  lacks equality and justice as it was imposed by coercion and the threat of force.Iran's recent measures aim at controlling and annexing Abu Mousa island  thus following in the footsteps of the previous Iranian Government which  in 1971 militarily occupied the two islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates  namely. Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. Naturally  the recent Iranian measures will increase tension and threaten stability and security in the region. They contravene the principles of peaceful coexistence and good-neighborliness and undermine the traditional relations between the two countries.On 29 November 1971  Iranian armed forces attacked and occupied the islands of Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. This resulted in the killing of a number of civilians and the eviction of the rest by military force. On the next day  30 November  Iran occupied Abu Mousa island. In response  the United Arab Emirates moved on every Arab and international level  and at every forum  including the Security Council  to resolve this issue and regain those three islands  which are an indivisible part of its territory. Throughout more than 20 years of Iranian occupation of those islands  the United Arab Emirates opted for quiet diplomacy and used every diplomatic channel in the firm belief that right is on its side and that the three islands will return to its sovereignty. This conviction has been strengthened by the current international climate and the desire of both the United Arab Emirates and the international community to resolve regional conflicts  with the aim of maintaining international peace and security by diplomatic means  in accordance with international law.Proceeding from the desire of the United Arab Emirates to settle all outstanding issues and problems relating to the continued occupation by the Islamic Republic of Iran of the two islands of Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb and its violation of the 1971 Memorandum of Understanding relating to the island of Abu Mousa  and in the interests of stability and security in the region  meetings between the two countries were held recently in our capital  Abu Dhabi  with a view to reaching a peaceful negotiated settlement. However  the Iranian delegation refused to discuss ending the military occupation of the two islands of Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb and refused to have the case referred to the International Court of Justice. Consequently  the United Arab Emirates had no recourse but to put the issue before the international community. My statement today stems from our desire to find a peaceful settlement of this dispute based on the principles of the United NationsCharter and the norms of international law.International documents and historical / geographical facts  confirm that  from time immemorial  sovereignty over the three islands in question has been the United Arab Emirates'. Iran's military occupation of the islands has not changed their legal status. Under international law  occupation by the use of force does not bestow upon the occupying Power sovereignty over the territory it occupies  regardless of the length of that occupation.Iran's occupation of the islands and the subsequent measures it has taken contravene the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and run counter to the principles of international law  particularly the principle of respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of States  good-neighborliness  non-interference in the internal affairs of others  the non-use of force or the threat of force and the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.My country has been and continues to be prepared to resolve this matter by peaceful means in accordance with Article 33 of the United Nations Charter  taking into consideration that sovereignty over the three islands of Abu Mousa and Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb belongs to the United Arab Emirates. In this context  we call upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to move towards the settlement of this problem by those means in accordance with the rules of international law and the fundamental principles that govern international relations.The Gulf region still suffers from Iraq's aggression against the sister State of Kuwait. The international response to that aggression  as embodied in Security Council resolutions and the subsequent steps that culminated in the liberation of Kuwait  represent a positive application of the principles of the Charter and international law. It is also a clear indication of the international community's commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty of States  and to defend them.In this respect  we reaffirm our insistence that it is incumbent upon Iraq to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions. Moreover  we urge the international community to exert more pressure on the Iraqi regime to secure the speedy release of Kuwaitis and other detainees and prisoners of war so as to put an end to this human tragedy which runs counter to the most fundamental principles of human rights and international law.The end of the cold war and of the possibility of military confrontation between East and West has led to the settlement of certain intractable regional disputes. Moreover  it has become possible  under the prevailing conditions of international legality reflected in the unanimity of the Security Council  to move forward to resolving other chronic disputes.Proceeding from this  we would have hoped to experience the effects of these positive trends in the new world order in our Arab area  and particularly in the endeavors to settle the Middle East conflict and the Palestinian problem  which is the core of that conflict. Our region has suffered greatly from the devastating negative effects of those two unsolved problems. It was against this backdrop that the United Arab Emirates welcomed the call to convene the Madrid Conference  supported the current Middle East peace negotiations and participated in the multilateral negotiations on the basis of the international legality embodied in United Nations resolutions  most notably Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).My country has called and continues to call for Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab and Palestinian territories  including the Syrian Golan Heights and the Holy City of Al-Quds and for enabling the Palestinian peopleto exercise their right to self-determination. In conformity with the United Nations Charter  we express our opposition to the acquisition of territory by force. Moreover  we call upon Israel to desist from confiscating Palestinian and Arab lands and completely to halt its settlement activities and the deportation of Palestinians.My country supports the unremitting efforts of the Government of sisterly Lebanon to extend its national authority to all of the territory of Lebanon within the framework of the Taif Agreement  which was accepted by all the parties concerned. In this context  we call for the full implementation of international legality  as embodied in Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which calls for Israel's withdrawal of its armed forces from all of Lebanon's territory. He also urge the international community to help the Lebanese Government in the reconstruction of Lebanon and the achievement of peace  stability and security in the country.We follow with great pain and sadness the suffering of the fraternal Somali people. The fighting raging in Somalia has resulted in substantial loss of human life and property. We appeal to all the parties concerned and to all national forces in Somalia to put an end to the bloodshed and to set aside their differences. dialog should replace this internecine fighting  and all the parties concerned should give their full support to the international efforts aimed at bringing about a peaceful settlement of theirdisputes.Through its financial support and active participation in international relief efforts  the United Arab Emirates has tried to alleviate the suffering and distress of millions of our brethren in Somalia. He have also supported the Arab and international efforts aimed at reaching a settlement that would restore and safeguard the territorial integrity  stability and internal security of Somalia.He commend the unremitting efforts of the international community as represented by the League of Arab States  the Islamic Conference  the Organization of African Unity  and the United Nations to provide humanitarian assistance and support to Somalia and to facilitate the return of peace and stability to that country in implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions.The unspeakable tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is cause for grave concern to us all. The entire world is shocked at the immeasurable loss of human lives and the brutality of the crimes that are being committed against the people of that beleaguered republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina who are being massacred daily because of their ethnic and religious identity. And this is in addition to the arbitrary destruction of historic and religious monuments.He  like others  put the blame for this tragedy squarely on Serbia and Montenegro and their policy of ""ethnic cleansing""  aggression  expansion and violation of the independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this respect we condemn the practices of the Serbian forces and the Yugoslav army and the criminal acts they continue to perpetrate against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He call upon theto exercise their right to self-determination. In conformity with the United Nations Charter  we express our opposition to the acquisition of territory by force. Moreover  we call upon Israel to desist from confiscating Palestinian and Arab lands and completely to halt its settlement activities and the deportation of Palestinians.My country supports the unremitting efforts of the Government of sisterly Lebanon to extend its national authority to all of the territory of Lebanon within the framework of the Taif Agreement  which was accepted by all the parties concerned. In this context  we call for the full implementation of international legality  as embodied in Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which calls for Israel'^ withdrawal of its armed forces from all of Lebanon's territory. We also urge the international community to help the Lebanese Government in the reconstruction of Lebanon and the achievement of peace  stability and security in the country.We follow with great pain and sadness the suffering of the fraternal Somali people. The fighting raging in Somalia has resulted in substantial loss of human life and property.

He call upon theSecurity Council to take all the necessary measures prescribed in the Charter in order to preserve the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and to safeguard its security  political independence and territorial integrity.The recent positive developments in South Africa  most notably the meeting of the leaders of the parties to the conflict  reinforce our belief in the importance of exerting additional international efforts in support of this peaceful process with the aim of reaching an agreement that would lead to the establishment of a democratic  non-racial society in which equality will prevail regardless of race  color or creed.The new world order  which seeks to rid the world of nuclear  chemical  biological and other weapons of mass destruction  must be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence  prohibition of the use or threat of use of force  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  and the right of every State to choose the course that best suits its development and the conservation of its natural resources. These are the principles that have guided the United Arab Emirates since its independence. Today  these principles assume greater significance because we are committed to the building of a world order anchored in justice and equality  without the threat of force. Recent events have proved that political goals cannot be achieved by military means. It follows  therefore  that the logical choice before us is to work towards achieving security for all through total nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of other weapons of mass destruction.We believe that such courageous steps  if taken  will promote international and regional security and strengthen the role of the United Nations in this regard.The end of the cold war and its bipolarity places a greater responsibility on the United Nations in dealing with world economic problems. This emphasizes the general consensus at the last session of the Economic and Social Council  which affirmed that the goals of peace  development and justice are complementary.At present  the developing countries continue to face an unfavorable international economic climate that limits their development efforts. That climate has several manifestations the most prominent of which is the increasing deterioration of the conditions of many developing countries. Needless to say. this deterioration has a deleterious effect on the world economy as a whole.The role of the United Nations in the area of promoting international cooperation for development is based upon the principles set forth in the Charter  which take into consideration the universality of the United Nations and the equality of all its Member States.The new importance attached to development and environmental issues marks a significant step forward in international economic cooperation for development. The Rio de Janeiro Summit gave rise to a new concept of international cooperation based on international participation within the framework of the right of every State to utilize its natural resources in accordance with its developmental and environmental strategies.There is no doubt that cooperation between the countries of the South themselves is indispensable for the resumption of the dialog between North and South. By virtue of its promoting common interests  such dialog  if resumed  will promote the process of social and economic development and thus contribute to the emergence of a more secure and stable world. This session marks the beginning of a phase of transition from a past mired in ideological conflicts  confrontation and rivalry to a future that may well usher in an era of understanding  cooperation and peaceful coexistence in a world of equality  development and justice for all.In the words of the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization ""He need a new spirit of commonality  commitment and intellectualcreativity to transform a period of hope into an era of fulfillment.""This is more than an expression of faith. It is  indeed  our duty towards humanity and our future generations. "
"5",223,"ARG",47,1992,"I should like to congratulate the President on his election. I am convinced that his work at this session will be crowned with success  as was that of his predecessor. Ambassador Shihabi  to whom we express our gratitude for his outstanding work. We have noted with satisfaction how our Organization  in keeping with its universalist vocation  has increased its membership in the course of the past year. We welcome the delegations of Croatia  Slovenia  Bosnia and  68 Herzegovina  Kyrgyzstan  Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan  Moldova  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Armenia  Azerbaijan  Tajikistan  and San Marino. Their presence is perhaps the clearest demonstration of the deep-seated and positive changes that have occurred in important parts of the world since the end of the cold war. Moreover  we would like to extend our recognition to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  for his hard and valuable work in the course of the first year of his term of office  thereby continuing the excellent job done by his predecessor  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. The Secretary-General's stewardship has already had a sizeable impact on the current international situation. In our view  the general panorama of international relations  despite some serious regional conflicts  gives rise to promising prospects throughout the world. The end of the cold war and the considerable extension of democracy and the economic opening-up in many countries encourage that perception. This will necessarily lead to a reformulation of the North-South relationship that will replace confrontation with cooperation. That perception does not imply ignoring the seriousness of some regional conflicts  in particular in the former Yugoslavia or the tragic situation of such countries as Somalia. Neither war  hunger  poverty nor disease has been eliminated. Far from it: situations persist that evoke horror and concern. Moreover  in some regions there are still significant disputes that  though lacking the tragic aspects of the troubles I have mentioned  none the less impede the consolidation of stability. The case of the Malvinas Islands  to which I shall refer later  is one example. In that regard  the situation has unfortunately been affected recently by unilateral positions taken by the British Government on the sensitive matters of hydrocarbons.  69-70 In any case  apart from these issues  in recent years the world has taken important steps towards creating a better framework for solving serious problems. The fundamental change has undoubtedly been the more effective functioning of the system of collective security established in San Francisco in 1945. That major development is the prerequisite for moving towards full respect for the purposes and principles of this Organization. That explains the fundamental role of the Security Council  to which the Charter allocated paramount responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  and the necessity for all States firmly to support that body and implement its decisions. Convinced of that  in keeping with Article 25 of the Charter we strongly support the decisions of the Security Council. We did so with regard to the Gulf by participating in the coalition to liberate Kuwait  and we continue to do so through our increasingly active presence in the peace-keeping operations of the United Nations.  71 Our support of the Security Council flows from our deeply-rooted beliefs about the rules of conduct of civilized nations  from an appropriate assessment of the world power balance and from our perception of Argentina's actual interests. After long years of miscalculations and frustrations  today Argentina needs to grow and develop. Our chances of doing so depend to a great extent on our own efforts  but also on the existence of a world and regional context of dialogue and cooperation that will enable us to devote our energy and resources to that task. As a result  we also favour the regional development of more specific formulas for cooperation with the United Nations. There can be no doubt that the United Nations cannot on its own guarantee the climate of detente that we need  which is to say that each region should create mechanisms of its own. We  therefore  together with other American countries  have supported reforms to the charter of the Organization of American States with a view to giving it the power to respond politically to breakdowns in democracy in our hemisphere. The organization is studying specific responses  which we trust will soon be adopted. By the same token  we have contributed  together with our neighbours  to consolidating a promising subregional framework. The climate of harmony and cooperation between the countries of the southern cone is a veritable example for the world  and is the result of promising agreements on economic integration  such as the Southern Cone Common Market  and of specific measures to build confidence and transparency in the area of security. Our countries are firmly united in the struggle against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Argentina  for its part  has turned this struggle into one of the fundamental axes of its foreign policy. The achievements have been particularly significant in the relationship between Argentina and Brazil; in a few short months  we have signed a  72 bilateral agreement on nuclear safeguards  set up a bilateral agency for accounting and control of nuclear materials  signed an agreement on full safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency - which has already been ratified by my country and have successfully pushed for amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco to allow it to come fully into force. In this latter effort we have also joined with Chile and  later  with Mexico. The changes to the Treaty of Tlatelolco are very positive  since they offer guarantees that did not exist before on the control system  special inspections and the protection of technological secrets. Argentina  Brazil and Chile have committed themselves to beginning the process of legislative approval of the amendments promptly. We are sure that in a few months all of Latin America and the Caribbean will be protected by a nuclear-free zone in full operation. In addition to measures taken in the nuclear area  the southern cone countries have signed the so-called Mendoza Declaration on chemical and bacteriological weapons. This model document  which eradicates these weapons from our region  is in complete conformity with the Convention on Chemical Weapons recently negotiated in Geneva; that Convention has Argentina's support  and is an undeniable triumph in the struggle against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Argentina's firm commitment in this area has also been reflected in concrete form in our domestic legislation. This year the Argentine Government issued a decree which regulates sensitive nuclear  chemical  bacteriological and missile exports  and incorporates major international agreements  such as the Missile-Technology Control Regime (MTCR) outlines and the so-called Australian ""List of chemicals""  into Argentina's legal system. It also stipulates that Argentina shall coordinate its actions in the area of  73 non-proliferation with other countries that have a similar approach. We plan to accept the invitation to join the group of nuclear-exporting countries in the near future. Naturally  if the main elements of the MTCR are incorporated into Argentine legislation  they would expect our country to become a member of that system. I should like to emphasize that  besides contributing effectively to non-proliferation  the new policy should serve to reopen Argentina's access to high technology through international cooperation. Its former ambiguous policy in this regard was a major obstacle in this field and was responsible  to a great extent  for the technological backwardness of our country  and for hindering procurement even of spare parts and minor supplies for our defence. Another important contribution to stability in our part of the world has been the complete normalization of diplomatic relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom and the development of growing and fruitful economic and trade links between the two. However  the dispute concerning sovereignty over the Malvinas  Georgia and South Sandwich islands still persists. Today I reaffirm the sovereign rights of my country over these territories and their maritime areas. The permanent defence and reaffirmation of these inalienable rights are at the core of Argentine foreign policy. Thus  the recent decision of the United Kingdom Government to move unilaterally into prospecting for oil in the area in dispute is strongly rejected by my country. This rejection has been immediately transmitted to the United Kingdom Government and to the potential prospecting companies. This imprudent step by the United Kingdom stands in the way of the real opportunities for cooperation in the South Atlantic and does not strengthen the good bilateral relationship in which both countries are strongly interested.  74 These developments hinder our developing creative and pragmatic formulas which  without undermining our inalienable rights  would foster cooperation in the South Atlantic. We are convinced that the establishment of a cooperative framework rather than of a confrontational one would benefit all those who live in the South Atlantic area  including the inhabitants of the Malvinas. It is the duty of the Argentine and British Governments to do their utmost towards that end by overcoming major problems such as the ones that I have described. The Secretary-General is the author of the document entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  which is a fundamental contribution towards outlining the future structure of the United Nations. The document clearly indicates what road must be taken to strengthen the Organization  particularly in the area of preventing and ending conflicts. Argentina supports this document  which is to a great extent in line with the conclusions of the Rio Group. We share  in particular  the opinion of the Secretary-General that it is necessary to set in motion all the mechanisms of collective security provided for in the Charter  in a framework of strict observance of the areas of competence established therein. Peace-keeping operations have become one of the main instruments of the international community. This year we have witnessed an unprecedented participation by the Blue Helmets in four continents. Argentina has decided  for its part  as a major component of its foreign policy  to participate actively in this new development by providing military personnel and materiel. In that connection  I wish to point out that the financing of peace-keeping operations must be effected in a manner that balances the need to ensure the effectiveness of such operations and the financial capabilities of Member States. In that connection  we emphasize the special  75 responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council in that respect  as well as the greater capability of the more economically developed countries to cope with such expenditures. The Secretary-General's report is at the same time an essential document in the development of appropriate responses to current conflicts. Some of these need decisive action on the part of the international community. It is vital for us to continue to exert maximum pressure to put an end to the tragedy in former Yugoslavia. Argentina supports the steps taken by the Security Council  the Secretary-General and the European Economic Community  and joins with those who demand respect for self-determination  for minorities and for the boundaries of the republics of former Yugoslavia. The tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina  with which Argentina is in the process of establishing diplomatic relations  is a challenge to us all. We join in the appeal to all parties to respect the principles I have mentioned  and we demand that Belgrade contribute effectively to putting an end to the aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The presence of more than a thousand Argentine soldiers in the United Nations Protection Force bears witness to our interest in a solution that respects both the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We are also following  with concern  the difficulties in Cambodia and the lack of progress in Western Sahara  and we are following political developments in southern Africa with great attention. Argentina  for its part  is paying particular attention to the special situation in South Africa. Argentina and South Africa share the South Atlantic area and have  75(a-z) great opportunities for future cooperation. That is why we again urge the Government  the African National Congress of South Africa and all parties involved in the search for a concerted solution to persevere  through negotiations  in their efforts to find a solution to the serious problem created by the policy of apartheid. The process of eradicating these terrible practices must be completed and  at the same time  the establishment of a democratic  free and peaceful society must be ensured in that great country.  76 I have mentioned the South Atlantic. We are firmly convinced that the time has come for all the countries involved to set up concrete mechanisms of cooperation in that important maritime area. The South Atlantic is one of the few areas in the world on which there are no specific agreements. Argentina advocates decisive advancement in that area. Progress in the Peace Conference strengthens our hope for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. We feel that the role of the General Assembly at this crucial stage is not so much to ratify well-known positions as it is to contribute decisively to promoting agreement and flexibility among the parties. Argentina is prepared to cooperate actively in the efforts to achieve that goal. We must say that we feel deep admiration and respect for the Middle Eastern leaders who have had the courage and vision to put aside the rigidity of dialectics and undertake these crucial negotiations with determination and in a conciliatory spirit. We Argentinians have also suffered the consequences of the irrational violence unleashed everywhere as a result of that serious situation. The attack carried out last 17 March against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires  with its heavy toll  was an unmistakable sign of the tragic imprint left by these conflicts at the criminal hands of international terrorism. As regards other regional situations  we are pleased to note the current progress in the high-level talks between the Cypriot leaders and the Secretary-General. As a result  we look forward to a prompt agreement in the framework of the good-offices mission of the Secretary-General. We wish to commend the parties involved in this conflict  including Greece and Turkey  for their spirit of cooperation  and the permanent members of the Security Council for their active role in this process.  77 We reiterate our firm support of the Security Council decisions regarding the situation in the Persian Gulf and we insist that Iraq should abide by its resolutions and fully respect the human rights of all minorities and of the population as a whole. One of the essential conditions for peace is the full enjoyment of human rights. Argentina reaffirms its active role in the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental liberties in the deliberative international bodies on human rights  both at the United Nations and the Organization of American States (OAS). It is also fitting to mention some serious problems that the international community must face  attack and eliminate once and for all. I am referring to drug trafficking  terrorism and corruption. The first one drug trafficking - is at present a subject deserving of concerted action by States. This  however  is not enough. We must get to the deepest roots of this scourge at all its stages  from production to consumption  and in particular the movement and laundering of its financial resources. In their actions in this area  States must recognize the various characteristics of the countries that are most involved. Argentina has joined and will join any initiative that will allow us to put an end to this malady that affects the whole of the international community  without exception. As for terrorism  there can be no questions  only an answer in the form of the strongest  most determined and implacable commitment of each State to struggle against it until it is eradicated. Its activities are always deadly and cruel. This year Argentina suffered one of the most savage terrorist attacks in the annals of international crime. Our country will support all steps or processes that will strengthen law and the respect for standards of coexistence among nations.  78 Finally  the cancer of corruption must be rooted out. It is harmful and pernicious and undermines the efforts of States and their civilian societies for the healthy development of their political  economic and social institutions. Corruption knows no borders and coexists  or attempts to do so  with any political or legal system on our planet. Argentina is in the front lines of the struggle to combat this crime and to create the mechanisms for doing so. Allow me to return to our region and refer to some other facts of great significance. Argentina's foreign policy is geared towards creating an external context favourable to the competitive incorporation of Argentina into the world economy. In that regard  we have made the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) the axis of our activity in Latin America. The agreement on trade and investment with the United States  called ""Four plus One""  shows that the concepts of MERCOSUR and the Initiative for the Americas are fully compatible. With MERCOSUR we endeavour to create a stable external context for the economic growth of the four countries through the implementation of collective economic discipline freely agreed upon by the parties. The concept is characterized by a marked realism as to our potential and limitations. MERCOSUR is not  nor could it be  the embryo of a new economic fortress. Before the end of 1994 we will have a common external tariff  but we have already clearly determined that it must allow for the increasing international competitiveness of our economies. It would make no sense to close at the subregional level the doors that each of our countries is opening at the national level. The reference to MERCOSUR leads me to recall that Argentina expects the creation of great economic blocs to be the forerunner of freer  more efficient  79 international trade  not of a greater space to make protectionism legal or to disguise clear market reserves. Argentina prefers to believe in the sincerity of the purposes stated in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and in the principles outlined to launch the Initiative for the Americas  the same ones that form the basis of the Treaty of Asuncion  in which MERCOSUR is defined. But my country notes with justifiable concern the way in which the most powerful economies on our planet interpret the concept of opening the market  since they promote such opening only for those sectors in which their countries are competitive or where they themselves exert influence on international prices. Part of that conception is to be found in the section on agriculture and other decisions that have so far stalled the Uruguay Round of GATT. Precisely in the agricultural sector  the leaders of those economies do not display excessive courage or desire to put an end to annual subsidies of more than $300 billion for production and foreign trade  with which they distort international markets and  besides  contribute to environmental degradation. Some of their decisions reflect a greater interest in solving minor difficulties in domestic policy than in avoiding isolationism and trade wars. Only very rich countries can pursue policies that are so harmful and costly that they undermine the finances of their urban populations and of course do considerable harm to the developing countries. This is also an apt occasion to confirm our great satisfaction at the political agreements reached by Canada  the United States and Mexico to create a free-trade zone. We trust that this achievement will be one of the central modules of the broader zone foreseen when launching the Initiative for the Americas to make of the hemisphere one great market. While this takes shape   80 we are worried at the many legislative attempts fiat tend to hinder the access of developing countries to the various international markets. Argentina has started a process of sustained economic stability based on a market economy in the framework of a democratic system. This has allowed us to initiate proceedings for our admission to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  where we hope to take part in the discussion of global and sectoral economic policies that may contribute to economic growth. At this session  the General Assembly will consider the report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de Janeiro. No previous international event had convened so many Heads of State or of government. In the framework of the new international situation  it has been possible for the first time ever to reach basic agreements on questions that are important for the survival of this planet as we know it. The progress achieved on the American continent does not preclude the persistence of some specific problems. At the last two sessions of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  Argentina made clear its position regarding the situation in Cuba. At all times my country has expressed a desire that Cuba should bring about the necessary reforms to allow its full integration  both political and economic  into the community of democratic  pluralistic nations. I repeat that it was expressed as a brotherly wish  not as interference in the affairs of that country Argentina strongly condemned the coup d'etat against the President of Haiti and supported the relevant resolutions adopted by the Organization of American States (OAS). I myself was part of the delegation that accompanied the Secretary-General of the OAS to Port-au-Prince. We have kept our  80(a-z) diplomatic ties with Haiti  have maintained our embassy there and have spared no effort to support an understanding between the parties to the conflict. As regards El Salvador  the signing of the peace agreement is a landmark in the process of peace-making in Central America and we hope that the understanding reached can be extended to the rest of the region.  81 Peru  our sister country on the Pacific  continues to face serious problems in its development and progress  suffering the effects of drug trafficking and of bloody nihilistic terrorism. We should  however  note the advances recently made on that front. We also welcome the process which will  we hope  lead to a well-balanced and full return of Peru's representative democracy. We are awaiting with close attention and a willingness to cooperate the constituent elections of 22 November. With regard to Chile  we continue to move slowly and inexorably closer to a final solution to all of the unresolved border problems  along the world's third longest frontier. Very little still remains to be done before we reach a full understanding  which is already yielding fruitful results in advance  with greater and very promising economic cooperation. We are replacing a long history of discord with a full and fraternal relationship. I cannot conclude without commenting on the actions of the Rio Group. I reaffirm my conviction that it has proved to be a highly effective mechanism for consultations and for reaching political agreements  as was shown in such situations as the one which earlier this year endangered institutional stability in Venezuela. The Rio Group has also demonstrated an important presence and participation in connection with Peru and Haiti. It has provided an excellent tool for communication  information and consultation with  inter alia  the European Community  with which  in addition to the enormously important Santiago Declaration in May of this year  a significant cooperation agreement was signed. In 1992 we have been able to confirm that the United Nations  free of the shackles imposed on it by the cold war  is now fulfilling the essential role entrusted to it by mankind in 1945. Although the sources of distress still persist  we can affirm that we are moving towards the consolidation of the  82 ruling principles that guide the United Nations  and we reiterate our hopeful conviction that the closing years of the strife-torn twentieth century will enable us to strengthen universal respect for the letter and spirit of the Charter  which will mean the triumph of wisdom  solidarity and justice. "
"6",248,"ARM",47,1992,"At the outset  on behalf of the Republic of Armenia and the Armenian people  I wish to express my gratitude for the support of the General Assembly for our request to be admitted to membership of the United Nations. I wish also to congratulate you. Ambassador Ganev  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Today is the first anniversary of Armenia's declaration of independence  so it is a signal honour for me to be addressing the General Assembly. The past year has been significant both for a newly independent Armenia as well as for the international community at large. Our Government  which was formed as a result of free elections  has continued its policy of democratization  economic liberalization and the creation of a State of law. The Parliament of Armenia has voted in favour of freedom of conscience  freedom of religion and freedom of the press. It has instituted a multiparty system and has acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and all international conventions on human rights.  3 In this relatively short time  Armenia has succeeded in carrying out agrarian reform by distributing to the people 80 per cent of its agricultural lands. Moreover  Parliament has already enacted the laws underlying denationalization  and has begun the privatization of small and medium-sized enterprises and of certain service industries. In addition  bills relating to reform of the banking system  credit  finance  the budget and communications are already before Parliament with a view to creating the legal infrastructure necessary for a market economy. The entrenchment of democracy and economic reform are taking place against the backdrop of blockades  skyrocketing unemployment  free-falling standards of living and an acute energy crisis. That energy crisis  which is the main reason for the drop in national production  is the result not only of regional blockades but also of the closing of our nuclear power plant for safety and ecological reasons. In those conditions the Government must still devote a major portion of its resources to rebuilding the Spitak region  hit hard by the earthquake of 7 December 1988. Democratization and independence have had a no less fundamental impact on the new direction of the foreign policy of the Republic of Armenia  which is based on two principles: First  the security of the State and the people hinges on normalized relations with all of our neighbours  on a negotiated solution to conflicts  and on strengthened regional economic cooperation. All of this should lead to the establishment of a system of regional collective security.  4-5 Secondly  Armenia is ready to participate in any constructive process that would guarantee the development of international economic and political cooperation and the strengthening of regional stability. That is why Armenia pursues an active policy in the Commonwealth of Independent States  in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and in the Black Sea economic cooperation process. Armenia wishes also to play a role in economic cooperation and a system of collective security in the Middle East. On the basis of those two principles  Armenia has already signed bilateral agreements with two of its neighbours: Georgia and Iran. We have also begun serious negotiations with Turkey on normalized relations with that country. In the light of the respective interests of our two countries and sharing a concern to restore regional stability  Armenia is convinced that it will be able to achieve that goal on the basis of international law. With equal persistence  Armenia has been pursuing that policy with respect to its fourth neighbour  Azerbaijan. Armenia harbours no territorial claims with respect to Azerbaijan  but we insist that the people of Nagorno-Karabakh not be relegated to the status of ethnic minority  that they not be denied their right of self-determination and that this population not be sacrificed on the altar of the principle of territorial integrity.  6 It is indeed high time that the security of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh should be ensured with sound international guarantees. Armenia is very pleased to note that the position which we have been defending since the outset of the conflict is being increasingly taken into account and even endorsed by other States involved. For us it is clear that the cease-fire is the necessary initial stage in advancing towards a solution to this question. Negotiations must follow  first between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh  together with the necessary international guarantees  and  secondly  between Azerbaijan and Armenia to resolve questions arising from the conflict. In order to bring about the required cease-fire  Armenia has welcomed all proposals made to date and thus Armenia  like the parliament of Nagorno-Karabakh  has just given an unconditional and favourable response to the cease-fire appeal made by the President of the Minsk group of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Unfortunately  Azerbaijan did not adopt the same position. At all events  Armenia is prepared to make a positive contribution in talks with Azerbaijan in the hope that the attention which we give to the well-being of all the peoples in the region will lead us to peace and stability. It is not too early to declare that the United Nations is in a position to assist in achieving these ends. As the Armenian people acceded to democracy and independence by constitutional and non-violent means  independent Armenia is moving towards peace and justice in the context of strict respect for international law. Similarly  in accord with the two principles I referred to previously  Armenia has attempted to transform the burden of history into an historic  7 opportunity to lay bare the historic roots that unite it with this region  to restore the communality of culture which connects it with the peoples of this region  and to transform ethnic and religious differences into a source of wealth conducive to resolving all the problems besetting our common house. This year was equally significant for the United Nations. The Republic of Armenia would like to congratulate the Secretary-General of the United Nations on his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). The report contains a number of constructive proposals to which I am sure the United Nations will give the closest scrutiny. Whether it be as a Member of the United Nations or as a party involved in a regional conflict  Armenia is very interested in proposals to create specific machinery for the implementation of Article 43 of the United Nations Charter. The creation of peace-keeping and cease-fire forces  binding arbitration for conflicts  and encouraging active recourse to the International Court of Justice under the aegis of the United Nations would be a major success for the international community and the new world order. Armenia realizes that other proposals to change the structures of the United Nations also contain constructive ideas which  if they were acted upon  would make it possible more surely to achieve collective security and the concepts of the new world order in the United Nations today. Armenia has acquired some experience in the creation of  new structures while the former ones are gradually disintegrating. Accordingly  we are fully prepared to participate in the creation and implementation of a new world  8-10 order so as to avoid inertia  a lack of will or imagination  or simply a lack of vigilance and cause a return to the old system which attempted to impose solutions on peoples by involving them in even more bloody conflicts. In the new world order States should be able to shoulder the problems of their neighbours regardless of considerations of race  religion or ideology. "
"7",281,"ATG",47,1992,"Exactly 500 years ago  in 1492  two worlds collided. That collision completely altered the fate of human civilization and the destinies of the two peoples involved. One people achieved ascending heights; the other virtually disappeared. What remains of the indigenous populations of the Caribbean  or much of the ""new world""  serves as a measurement of man's ability to be brutish in the pursuit of wealth. My Caribbean island country has been more than a witness of change in the 500-year decline  transformation and recreation of the region. From conquest through slavery  from colonial hegemony to political independence  Antigua and Barbuda has been a maker of history in the Caribbean and  indeed  in the larger region. In 1992  however  our country stands  with the rest of the world  on the threshold of yet another momentous collision. This time the collision is between human civilization and nature; this time there are no ascending heights; this time humanity itself could disappear. For 500 years  from Columbus to Rio  our forests and our oceans  our air and our lands - the Earth's gifts to humanity have been wrongly regarded as inexhaustible and unchanging. ""If Columbus uncovered our Earth's expanse  Rio revealed its limits."" Humanity  all agree  cannot march along on its present course for another 500 years. In fact  humanity cannot proceed with business as usual for even another 100 years. Island countries  like my own and others in the Caribbean and in the Pacific  stand in real danger of being submerged by swollen oceans. Moreover  global warming  insidious climate change  ozone-layer depletion  the loss of forests and other dangers threaten humanity's very existence. Dramatic changes in the systems of production  distribution and disposal are required of the industrialized countries if we are to save ourselves. Developed countries cannot consume the Earth's resources at current rates; developing countries cannot be made to languish in the dusty exhaust of rapidly accelerating technological societies. Sustainable development that takes account of environmental costs must begin to guide humanity's technological future. Only the United Nations and its General Assembly can construct the new world which  in Rio  this family of nations agreed to commence building immediately. It is thus fitting that  in 1992  a representative of Bulgaria has been selected to preside over the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. His nation is taking part in a great regional experiment  the outcome of which is sure to influence the course of human civilization worldwide. Antigua and Barbuda hails Bulgaria for its courage  and I pledge the full support of my delegation for the President throughout the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Permit me to applaud the outgoing President  Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  for his unfailing efforts to bring reform to the United Nations and for his diligence during Saudi Arabia's year-long tenure. This community owes Mr. Shihabi a debt that can be repaid only through a continuous effort to strengthen the General Assembly during the coming years. We must focus our efforts on economic  social and humanitarian matters with no less vigour than is currently directed at political and security concerns. Antigua and Barbuda can be relied upon to promote the multilateral approach to problem solving  confident that multilateralism will always prove to be superior. In that regard  it may be recalled that when we commenced the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly one year ago Haiti was free. The first  democratically elected President of Haiti stood at this podium. The United Nations had contributed to the ending of tyranny in the Caribbean's oldest but poorest Republic  and all delegations celebrated with President Aristide. Ten days after President Aristide""s triumphant declaration in this Hall  tyranny once again raised its ugly head in our sister Caribbean isle. The military plotters who brutally seized power in Haiti one year ago are still on their perch. But this Assembly will never rest until democracy is restored and Haiti's people are again free. Antigua and Barbuda  working within the framework established by the Organization of American States  will continue to press for the expansion of sanctions in order to isolate further the military regime in Haiti and to return Haiti to democracy. If we do not succeed quickly in Haiti  the United Nations will risk tarnishing its well-earned reputation for being able to tackle exceedingly complex problems in extremely violent situations in other corners of the globe. In South Africa  for example. United Nations sanctions have assisted in bringing the apartheid regime to the negotiating table. It was 46 years ago  in 1946  that India brought the question of apartheid in South Africa to the attention of the United Nations; today  179 Member States are anxious to see legalized racism exorcized from the body politic. Twelve weeks ago  when the Security Council convened to seek a solution to the violence in South Africa  my delegation gave notice to the racist regime that any attempt on its part to delay the establishment of democracy in South Africa by fomenting violence would cause us to press for the reintroduction of the sanctions that had been relaxed. We repeat our pledge today. While they praise the courage of those who have entered into constitutional talks  my countrymen will never lose sight of the fact that apartheid is an evil whose demise the world's peoples eagerly await. Until apartheid is eliminated. South Africa will continue to be excluded from this family of nations. Antigua and Barbuda takes this opportunity to welcome to our family the 12 newly independent nations that have emerged with the end of the cold war and the collapse of an empire. Island countries in the Caribbean gained their independence  beginning 30 years ago  during the decline of another empire. It is thus with a shared sense of exhilaration that we welcome Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to membership of the United Nations. It may be too late to caution our new Members to avoid the pitfalls of fierce nationalism and unharnessed ethnic rivalry. Both inevitably lead to fractious and violent turmoil  which  we know  surely end without victors. All multiracial and multi-ethnic societies must learn to settle historic and current differences peacefully. Notwithstanding the domestic discord which may obtain following the arrival of independence  small nations which dwell in the geopolitical shadow of a giant must be forever diligent in protecting their sovereignty. The United Nations  fostering as it does respect for international law  remains the most certain guarantor of a small nation's independence. Knowing the importance of the United Nations  therefore  we work towards fashioning a system which responds favourably to the interests of even the least among equals. Our world parliament cannot become  and must not ever appear to have become  the handmaiden of a few powerful Member States. The integrity of the United Nations lies in the ability of even its smallest Member to participate meaningfully in shaping United Nations policy. Antigua and Barbuda thus welcomes San Marino to membership in this our family of nations. As our smallest Member State  San Marino bears a special responsibility to pronounce on the responsiveness of the United Nations to the initiatives of the less powerful. Antigua and Barbuda pledges its fullest co-operation with the delegation of San Marino  now and in the future. We also congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  on demonstrating a willingness to speak boldly concerning matters to which insufficient attention has been paid. United Nations leadership must chart a course which promotes peace  justice and freedom wherever these cherished human values are in danger of disappearing. The danger to cherished human values is also manifested in underdevelopment. Island developing countries  and other small countries  must look increasingly to the multilateral institutions for varied assistance in finding solutions to vexing problems. The United Nations system cannot reduce its economic and social development roles without adversely affecting prevailing material conditions. Notwithstanding this admonition  our experience confirms that development is also greatly influenced by good governance and the intelligent use of scarce resources  including investment capital. While we have relied and will continue to rely on ourselves to provide good governance  our investment capital has to be imported. Our small size  however  puts us at the mercy of the major capital markets  over which Antigua and Barbuda  like other small countries  exercises not one iota of control. The United Nations  aware of the special disadvantages that are inherent in the small island developing country  must respond in a manner which appropriately reflects these circumstances. My delegation thus takes this opportunity to commend highly the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Its funding of  and support for  a number of beneficial projects within my region earns it great applause. However  we continue to object to the use of the per capita gross national product (GNP) device for determining development status and funding eligibility of small island countries. For large countries  the device is perfect. It was devised with large countries in mind. But when applied to a small island country  the per capita GNP device results in a distortion. The measurement device fails to take into account the much higher cost per person which small populations incur for routine services that are provided at minimal cost to large populations  even large populations in poor countries. It fails to reflect the inherent inability of our embryonic manufacturing industries to penetrate major markets because their production  levels reflect small size. It fails to reward good governance and sacrifice  preferring instead to believe the fiction that a well-run small island developing country has graduated  is developed and  hence  in need of no assistance because a distorted per capita GNP device so determines. We are flattered to be regarded as developed  but that characterization is inaccurate. We reject the per capita GNP device and therefore call for the use of more reliable indicators when assistance to small island developing countries is contemplated. In projects relating to improvement of the environment  small island developing countries have been successful in persuading their larger partners to accept the fact that their unique vulnerabilities require special consideration. In this regard  Antigua and Barbuda  in its country report to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)  identified high-priority areas pertaining to its heritage resources that require special assistance. It is our hope that the UNDP and its capacity 21 funding mechanism will be persuaded to acknowledge our special needs. Antigua and Barbuda applauds the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for its very compelling promotion of the rights of women. It takes no special effort for my small island developing country to recognize that successful development requires the unhindered contribution of every able-bodied adult  regardless of gender. The elimination of de facto discrimination against women is therefore of paramount importance in my country and my region. UNIFEM  an active partner in the development process  can rely upon Antigua and Barbuda's solid commitment to its universal objective of empowering women in order to strengthen development and to ensure that justice is gender-blind. The injustices heaped upon the heads of the world's indigenous peoples must also quickly cease. To that end  the United Nations has declared 1993 the International Year for the World's Indigenous People. In December 1993 progress made will be measured by deeds  not words. National legislation and funded projects which are intended to ensure the continued survival of the indigenous peoples that inhabit remote corners of the Earth must be in place. Having lost the indigenous Arawaks and Caribs of Antigua and Barbuda beginning in 1492  my country is duty-bound to ensure that powerless indigenous people who have inhabited the lands of their ancestors for many millennia are adequately protected by the United Nations. Each year  Antigua and Barbuda brings to the attention of the Assembly the state of affairs prevailing on Earth's last uninhabited continent Antarctica. Last year  we applauded when the 26 voting members of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties entered into a binding agreement forbidding mining and oil exploration on Antarctica for 50 years  until the year 2040. Although the agreement successfully curbs this generation's cupidity  we believe that Antarctica must never become the possession of large States only. Transforming Antarctica into a world park or protected area under the umbrella of United Nations control would be a more certain guarantee of its preservation. During the past year  more human beings died of starvation and violence in Somalia than the entire population of my country. Tens of thousands more will die in the coming months by self-inflicted violence complicated by the ravages of nature. The United Nations  recognizing the desperation of Somalia's 4.5 million people  must further increase its efforts to find a solution to the crisis.  On the question of Bosnia and Herzegovina  the United Nations has spared no effort to end the crisis. The European Community is apparently determined that some crises require more than a regional response. Those of us from Latin America and the Caribbean  whose regional organization has addressed the intractable question of Haiti with little success  have the benefit of the European experience as a guide. My country rejoices with the Central American countries as peace blankets their region. The sound of working hands has replaced the sound of working guns  we are told. If future civil war is to be prevented  however  the economic systems which prevail in Central America must become far more inclusive: the sharing of wealth must result in more than a trickle going to the poor. The trickling flow of peace in the Middle East is most heart-warming. Antigua and Barbuda applauds the Israelis and the Palestinians for finally sitting down together and negotiating their future. It is our hope that  soon  Israel will be allowed to exist within secure and accepted borders and that the Palestinians will have a sovereign State of their own. We rejoice at the wave of peace which has engulfed Lebanon. Despite the unresolved problems  which the electoral system has attempted to address  Lebanon is facing the future with a certainty of peace that has eluded it for more than a decade. A land as beautiful  as culturally diverse and as full of so many warm people as is Lebanon must pledge to enter the twenty-first century at peace with itself. My delegation concludes by recalling that the modern history of our peaceful Caribbean began 500 years ago when another world collided with it. The pursuit of accumulated wealth which propelled one world towards the other remains the motive force of the dominant civilization of today. Yet  complex webs have been weaved into this underlying theme  which even a small country  a small place  like mine can take credit in reshaping. For example  on 3 October 1736  exactly 256 years ago this year  an unsuccessful slave revolution took place in Antigua. The leaders of that revolution are the heroes of the freedom-loving people of Antigua and Barbuda. In 1736  our heroes attempted to destroy a wicked system which guaranteed the most certain accumulation of wealth at the expense of human misery. By our own choosing  therefore  Antiguans and Barbudans of today  the descendants of those slaves and those slave-masters  have declared that in our hierarchy of values freedom is superior to all else. In 1992  the human being  not wealth accumulation  is at the centre of development and civilization. Yet  our countries are now engaged in a great debate about the future  and the United Nations General Assembly is the platform. The importance of keeping the entire United Nations system from becoming homogenized in its thinking is most important at a time when the emerging new world order is being shaped increasingly by a single Power. Our task is not merely to express a differing point of view  but to demonstrate in a concrete manner that the raison d'etre of the civilization of the next 500 years has not yet been decided. In fact  given the threat to the very existence of small islands from rising sea levels  violent hurricanes  hazardous-waste disposal and other looming environmental calamities  the burden of defining the future may very likely fall upon the thinkers and actors from these most vulnerable  small countries. Indeed  our Prime Minister  the Right Honourable V. C. Bird  has frequently said that small size does not mean small minds or the absence of grand ideas. And so  my countrymen and I  having learned well the lessons of our history  shall continue to do all in our power at this United Nations and elsewhere to influence the future. We shall rely upon our collective wisdom. the strength of our institutions  the vitality of our youth  and the will of our leadership to exercise that influence. Our very existence requires success; and so we shall succeed. "
"8",328,"AUS",47,1992,"I congratulate you  Mr Ganev  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. You take this important position at a very challenging time for the United Nations and its Member States  not least for your own country  which is so admirably consolidating the gains of the democratization process. The Australian delegation looks forward to working closely with you as the session progresses. I also extend  at the outset  Australia's very warm welcome to the 13 States for which this session will be their first as Members of the United Nations: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Moldova  San Marino  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan  Croatia  Slovenia  and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have  I believe  in our own highly multicultural Australian population immigrants from every one of those States  and we already feel  as a result  that we know them well. In the past year we have seen the total collapse of the bipolar global structure which had underpinned international relations since 1945. The risks of a global nuclear holocaust have receded almost to the vanishing point. So too have the sterile ideologies of the past which for so long set obstacles in the way of the development of a new international system of cooperation under the authority of the United Nations and its agencies. But while the opportunities for cooperation have never been greater  the challenges to the international community posed by regional conflicts  humanitarian crises and unresolved transnational problems have also never been greater. What is expected of the United Nations system is now immense  but there is still a very big question mark over the capacity of our system to deliver. In the past twelve months the international community has had some conspicuous success in meeting some of these challenges. We have seen  for example  the signing of the Paris Agreements on Cambodia last October  the recently completed negotiation of a chemical-weapons Convention text  the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) summit in Rio in June  movement forward in the Middle East peace process  and hopes for the resolution of the long-standing problems in Afghanistan  Cyprus and Western Sahara. But a number of problems have to date been beyond the capacity of the United Nations  or international cooperative efforts more generally  to resolve in a timely and wholly effective way. The most significant and tragic of these have been the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia. Equally  the world has failed so far in efforts to strengthen and expand the liberal international trading system through the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  a failure of just as much concern to the developing nations as to the developed. This session of the General Assembly gives us the opportunity of systematically reviewing where we have got to and how far we still need to go on the range of acute problems - political  economic and humanitarian - now confronting us around the globe. We are much assisted in this respect by the Secretary-General's report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  on some key aspects of which I want to focus in this statement. The report  although concentrating specifically on the role of the United Nations in peacemaking  peace-keeping and related areas  was of course written very much against the background of the total challenge facing the United Nations international system  and in particular the critical importance of finding lasting solutions to the age-old problems of basic human survival and  in the words of the Charter  ""better standards of life in larger freedom"".  If we have learned anything from the passage of years about the sources of conflict and war  and what is necessary to achieve peace and security  it is that these problems have to be addressed at many different levels. Threats to security arise not only from military ambition and the race to acquire armaments  but also from economic and social deprivation  from ignorance of countries about each other  from a failure to address problems that by their nature cross international boundaries  and from a failure by national leaders to trust the sense and judgment of their own people. An effective system of international cooperation to meet threats to peace and security itself has to operate at all these levels simultaneously. In the first place  when unbridled aggression occurs across national frontiers  the international community has to have a credible collective capacity to resist that aggression. Chapter VII of the Charter provides for such a peace-enforcement function. There is now in the post-cold-war era a manifest willingness in the international community to utilise interventionist Chapter VII functions  so long rendered impotent by the veto in the Security Council  in cases of overt aggression and other obvious cross-border threats to international peace and security. Of course not every case of aggression  or the deliberate infliction of suffering  occurs across State borders or in such a way as to clearly and unambiguously constitute a threat to international peace and security. And there will be a number of such situations in which the intervention of the international community could make a difference  so much so that there are large moral and political pressures upon us all to take action. It seems likely  unhappily  that the United Nations will increasingly be confronted with situations in which the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs will be matched by a compelling sense of international conscience. It may be that our Charter will never be capable of formal amendment so as to precisely define those circumstances in which such intervention is legitimate and those in which it is not. But recent experience has shown that there is an emerging willingness - which my country has certainly shared to accommodate collective intervention in extreme  conscience-shocking cases  and it may well be that a body of customary precedent will emerge over time and will constitute its own source of authority for such intervention in the future. The second level of necessary United Nations involvement in peace and security matters is peace-keeping: that activity which falls short of actual enforcement  but involves assistance on the ground in monitoring  supervising  verifying and generally securing the implementation of agreements once made. As the various peace-keeping operations now in place or planned for Cambodia  Africa  the Middle East and elsewhere amply make clear  an increasingly wide variety of activities  involving both military and civilian personnel  are being subsumed under this general umbrella: none of them are very clearly described in the letter of the United Nations Charter  but all of them are very clearly within its spirit. Australia strongly endorses the call by President Bush on 21 September to strengthen United Nations peace-keeping and related operations  and welcomes in particular the stated intention of the United States to look at ways of ensuring adequate financial support for these activities as well as for United Nations humanitarian activities. Financing and administration of United Nations peace-keeping operations are obviously key areas of its activity where decisions are necessary at this year's General Assembly. It is a source of regret that we  the nations of the world  have still not given the Secretary-General the financial resources or flexibility needed to undertake United Nations peace-keeping operations expeditiously. For its part  Australia would support the Secretary-General's call in ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) for the establishment at this session of a peace-keeping reserve fund  and for virtually automatic approval of one third of the anticipated budget for a peace-keeping operation to enable it to be deployed speedily and efficiently. We would also recommend that the Secretary-General consider further structural changes in the Secretariat as a means of improving the administration of peace-keeping operations  including the relocation of the Field Operations Division into the Department of Peace-keeping Operations. The third level of United Nations involvement in peace and security  and the most basic and important of all  is the prevention of conflict. We in the international community should be working hardest through the United Nations to create conditions that minimize insecurity and threats to peace  and which make it possible for specific high-risk situations to be addressed before they get to the point of requiring either peace-keeping or  worse still  coercive peace-enforcement responses. The effective prevention of conflict and risk minimization involve three quite distinct kinds of activity. In the first place  it involves addressing a variety of non-military threats to security; secondly  addressing the military risk to security posed by uncontrolled arms build-ups; and thirdly  putting in place the most effective possible preventive diplomacy and peacemaking arrangements to deal at an early stage with specific high-risk situations. I want to concentrate my remarks on what we should be doing  in this General Assembly and beyond  in each of these areas in turn. Among the gravest of all life-threatening non-military risks are those posed by humanitarian disasters  especially famine. The recurring tragedy of mass starvation in Africa often made worse by accompanying military conflict  but not wholly explained by that conflict underlines the need for the United Nations system as a whole  and the Security Council in particular  to strengthen its capacity to meet the problems of potential famine. Australia proposes the establishment of a group of senior officials from developed and developing countries and relevant United Nations agencies  supported by a strengthened Department of Humanitarian Affairs and by a comprehensive database  which would convene regularly to conduct high-level reviews of the global famine situation and identify emerging crisis situations. Such a group would be responsible for turning pledges into timely  life-saving deliveries of food to people in need  and would seek to ensure that donor contributions were complementary  properly coordinated and well-targeted. That high-level review group would report regularly  with appropriate recommendations  to the Security Council. Famine is only the most extreme example of a much more widespread global problem. The Secretary-General  in his address to the summit of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  identified our ""ultimate enemy"" as poverty. He argued for the indivisibility of peace and prosperity  of political and economic security  of democracy and development  and environmental protection and sustainable development  making the point that unless we meet the threat posed by poverty  it will undermine all the advances we make elsewhere. We need to have this firmly in mind as we act for the rest of this decade and beyond to meet non-military threats to peace and security. Two issues in particular will have a crucial influence on our ability to prevail over these threats. One is the retreat to protectionism  which could well result from a failure to reach agreement in the Uruguay Round  which will do untold damage to many economies around the world  particularly those of the poorest nations  which would effectively be excluded from the benefits of an expansion in world trade. We cannot let pass the opportunity  provided by this round of negotiations  to further liberalize world trade and establish equitable disciplines for the new components of world trade. The recent summit of the Non-Aligned Movement illustrated beyond a doubt that this is a view shared equally by developed and developing countries. The other important need in this context is for prompt and effective follow-up to the outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  and in particular the creation of an effective Commission on Sustainable Development. We cannot waste now the opportunity offered to us at Rio to make a serious attack on the elimination of global poverty  based on the principles of sustainable development. Ignoring these will produce  at best  only short-term solutions which will have little impact on our ability to secure the future of this planet. This places a particular onus on us at this session. Our decisions and actions will have a crucial bearing on how the concerns identified at Rio are taken forward. Natural disasters  acute poverty  famine and environmental degradation are all  along with war itself  major contributors to another great humanitarian problem and by extension security problem with which the international system is barely coping: the problem of unregulated population flows. Much important relief and rehabilitation work continues to be done for refugees and displaced persons by the relevant agencies  in particular the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  and some useful attention has been recently given to the problem by the General Assembly. But crises continue to escalate  and there are still problems evident in the coordination of responses between operating and supervising bodies. Those problems have to be addressed as a matter of urgency  and one obvious way to do so is  again  to strengthen the capacity of the new Department of Humanitarian Affairs. There is at least one other non-military threat to peace and security that Australia hopes will get increased attention from this General Assembly  and that is the failure of Governments to observe the fundamental standards of  human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration and the more detailed Covenants  to which so many of us have subscribed. The Secretary-General in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) very properly emphasizes in this context the question of the rights of minorities. It is understandable that  freed from the iron restraints of totalitarian regimes  some ethnic and linguistic groups have sought and no doubt will continue to seek - to establish their own political entities. As has been all too graphically demonstrated in the States of former Yugoslavia  Iraq and elsewhere  there is no easy answer to these aspirations  particularly when self-determination would in such cases be synonymous with fragmentation and itself be a source of threat to international peace and security. War  particularly civil war  also engenders many of the greatest abuses of human rights. The bulk of such aspirations to self-determination might  in fact  be met by stricter observance of human rights and guarantees of the rights of all minorities ethnic  religious  linguistic or social within democratic frameworks. The General Assembly will have before it at this session a draft declaration on the rights of minorities  endorsed earlier this year by the Commission on Human Rights. And the launch  later this session  of the International Year of the World's Indigenous People to which Australia is very strongly committed will be a further indication of our concern in this regard. Breaches of universal human rights standards remain  unhappily  all too common. In a country such as Burma or Myanmar - the security of the State is based on a denial of fundamental human rights and the application of democratic processes. In South Africa  the promise of a peaceful  negotiated transition to majority rule continues to be put at risk by recurring violence of appalling intensity  itself an all too obvious legacy of the apartheid system. These and too many other examples that could be mentioned show the dimensions of the problem still ahead of us. They confirm the importance of next year's World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna  particularly for those Governments needing further encouragement to adopt human rights policies - founded  I emphasize  not on so-called Western values  but on internationally accepted  universal standards of practice. Discussion at this session should play an important role in developing a consensus approach to the Conference. At the very least  I hope it will resolve the outstanding question of the agenda  which was left undecided at the recent preparatory meeting in Geneva. The General Assembly at this session might also usefully consider some other steps to consolidate respect for human rights. There is  for instance  a growing call by the international community for a mechanism to try individuals for breaches of international humanitarian law and other international crimes. Australia supports consideration being given to an international criminal jurisdiction to deal with such offences  and considers that the International Law Commission should continue its important work on this topic  specifically by drafting a statute for an international criminal court.  The end of the cold war notwithstanding  a major preventive effort by the international community is still necessary in relation to the military threat to security posed by continuing arms build-ups. The climate for such an effort is certainly now encouraging. International endeavours in this field are finally producing results. After over 20 years  agreement has finally been reached on a chemical weapons Convention text. It is a historic achievement  and one for which Australia has worked particularly hard. Unanimous endorsement of this Convention  with a recommendation for its universal signature and ratification  would be one of the major outcomes of this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We should also build on the success we have had in concluding the chemical-weapons Convention to reinvigorate our efforts to reach agreement on other elements of the multilateral disarmament agenda. The benefits to mankind of the end of the cold war will be quickly lost unless progress  which is being made in bilateral arms control and disarmament negotiations between the United States and the former Soviet Union  is carried into the multilateral arms control process. We must redouble our efforts to achieve a world free from nuclear weapons  and the threat of nuclear war. We must work harder to obtain universal membership of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ensure its indefinite extension unamended in 1995. We should also continue the progress that has been made since the Gulf War to strengthen the nuclear safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and tighten export controls on nuclear and nuclear-related dual-use items. We should build on the moratorium on nuclear testing advanced by Russia and France. And I urge Member States to support once again the draft resolution that Australia will co-sponsor at this session on the comprehensive test-ban treaty. Increased transparency in military activities should continue to be a key objective for all Members of the General Assembly. I regard the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms Transfers  established by the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  as an important step in this process. Australia welcomes the Secretary-General's report on the operation of the Register and supports its adoption. At the recent summit of non-aligned countries in Jakarta  leaders expressed their deep concern over the negative impact of global military expenditure  and their support for the attainment of security at lower levels of armaments. We must all work to make good these pledges  thereby releasing sorely needed funds to help free the peoples of the world from want  as well as from the fear of war and destruction. Pursuing an effective arms control agenda and addressing a variety of non-military threats to security are all important ways of creating a general environment in which risks to security are minimized. So too are the peace-building strategies described in the Secretary-General's report  many of which are as much applicable to pre-conflict as to post-conflict situations. But the tools with the cutting edges in specific situations of conflict prevention and avoidance of conflict escalation are preventive diplomacy and peace-making. In ""An Agenda for Peace""  the Secretary-General emphasized the importance of preventive diplomacy as a cost-effective means of avoiding the human and material costs of conflict and the burdens involved in using armed force to resolve conflicts. Indeed  if we examine the worst conflicts over the last 12  months in the former Yugoslavia  Somalia and Afghanistan we could plausibly argue that  at least in the first two cases  more attention to preventive diplomacy may have avoided the catastrophes that befell those nations and peoples. Australia considers  therefore  that the challenge before the United Nations in the coming year will be to establish more effective processes for converting the promise of preventive diplomacy in all its aspects into reality. Effective preventive diplomacy cannot be ad hoc or peripheral to the other activities of the United Nations. What is required is a strengthened capacity within the United Nations to encourage and assist parties to disputes to resolve their differences peacefully. The crucial elements in making preventive diplomacy work are timing  adequate resources and the willingness of Member States to invest the United Nations with the authority to use all the means available for its effective implementation. In practice  the trigger for United Nations action  and the threshold for defining a situation as a threat to international peace and security  has tended to be the outbreak of armed hostilities. The earliest possible attention to potentially significant disputes is crucial if they are to be addressed before the parties have become committed and entrapped by their own rhetoric and actions. This in turn calls for the formation of a permanent unit within the Secretariat with an enhanced capacity to gather  receive and analyse not only basic facts  but also information about the concerns and interests of the parties to a dispute  in order better to prepare recommendations on possible action. This requires a more systematic approach to information-gathering and analysis  for which a professionally dedicated support unit in the Secretariat is essential. This will need in turn a sophisticated level of expertise and skill in the form of a nucleus of foreign affairs specialists and policy analysts experienced and knowledgeable in conflict resolution  with the skills that are necessary to encourage parties to a dispute to improve communication  minimize inflammation  define issues and create innovative and imaginative ways of reconciling their conflicting interests. Regular and routine field visits should allow an improved capacity for fact-finding  early-warning information gathering and the opportunity quietly to provide good offices. Staff should have the capacity to develop in-depth knowledge of emerging disputes and to gain the confidence of all parties at an early stage. An evaluation mechanism should be developed to collect  analyse and retain experience from such activities that could prove useful in other similar situations. I therefore applaud the decisions Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has so far taken to create geographically based divisions within the Department of Political Affairs  whose tasks will include the collection of information on various regions and the early identification and analysis of possible conflicts  and I do urge all Members to support the Secretary-General in further efforts to establish a professional and effective mechanism for preventive diplomacy. There is also scope  in encouraging greater use of preventive diplomacy  for more extensive training in the principles underpinning the concept. It is good to hear  in this context  that the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) is planning to launch a new fellowship programme in preventive diplomacy in 1993. I think it will be important for relevant United Nations Secretariat staff and diplomats and officials from Member States to participate in this fellowship programme. I am pleased to announce today that Australia will contribute US$ 50 000 to UNITAR to assist with the costs of the first year of the fellowship. I would urge that other Member States also consider a contribution  and participation by their officials. A significant challenge to an enhanced Secretariat role in preventive diplomacy will  of course  be the deep reluctance of many States to accept any suggestion that a contentious bilateral issue be internationalized. While there will no doubt continue to be caution about too early resort to Articles 35 and 99 which enable Member States and the Secretary-General  respectively  to bring disputes to the Security Council there should not be the same degree of reluctance to have regard to Article 33  which requires parties to a dispute to first seek a solution by negotiation  mediation or the like. What has been lacking hitherto is any real institutional capacity within the United Nations system to respond to such approaches on other than a wholly ad hoc basis. The building of such a capacity for quiet diplomacy in the way I have been describing would be a major step forward  and help over time to increase the confidence of Members in other more formal United Nations processes. I have today sought to give some substance  not just rhetorical support  to the proposition that the changed conditions of the post-cold-war world call for new responses from the United Nations. The Secretary- General has shown us some new directions in his ""Agenda for Peace"". What is needed now is action. In nearly all cases  no major new international machinery is called for or necessary  because the machinery is already there in the Charter rusty  in some cases  but still serviceable. What is needed  however  in virtually every case  is the lubrication of adequate financing and restructuring within the United Nations system to meet the increasing demands being made on it. One of the really fundamental tasks we need to move forward at this session is continuation of the process  accordingly  of United Nations reform. There is no single  or simple  enemy to peace in the contemporary world. The appalling situation in Somalia  and the looming crises in Mozambique and the Sudan  are demonstrations if any are still needed - that problems do not come in neatly defined packages. The Somalian situation involves  simultaneously  humanitarian assistance  peace-keeping and political negotiation  with no one of these elements being capable of delivery in isolation. The United Nations is now organizing itself in Somalia to deliver these elements in an integrated way  although it has been a difficult and Protracted process to get to this point. The task for the United Nations in the future is to learn from this experience and to devote the necessary resources to achieving the kind of cooperation between humanitarian and political strategies that is going to be increasingly necessary in the future if durable solutions are to be found to many real world problems. More and more attention is going to focus  as indeed it has already focused in this general debate  on the role and representativeness of the Security Council itself. As President Soeharto said last week  speaking in this respect on behalf of the whole non-aligned Movement  the post-cold war world is not the world as it was after the Second World War. Our guiding light should by all means continue to be the present terms of the Charter  but it should be within our collective capacity to work out the changes in the composition and methods of decision of the Security Council that will ensure that it can both fulfil its duty and command overwhelming consensus for its decisions in the years ahead. In many respects the task ahead of us  and ahead of the United Nations  is daunting. It is clear that we are part of an evolutionary process  with both the world and the United Nations adjusting to new demands. We must draw strength from the success achieved in the last 12 months  and from the progress we have made in improving global co-operation. But our success has not been uniform: we were not able to respond adequately to some key challenges. We must not ever lose sight of the goal ahead of us: a more stable and secure world  devoid of abject poverty  with all peoples able to enjoy basic rights and freedoms. And we must never avoid the responsibility we all have to achieve those goals. "
"9",375,"AUT",47,1992,"Let me start by offering you  Mr. President  my congratulations and best wishes. With your election an outstanding representative of the new democracies in Eastern Europe has been chosen to preside over this Assembly. I should also like to convey our appreciation to your predecessor. Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia. I wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General. His report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" contains timely suggestions for a world in which the very nature of conflicts has changed and which therefore has outgrown the traditional means of conflict management. Austria supports the Secretary-General in his quest to develop better instruments for the United Nations to discharge its ever-growing world-wide responsibilities to prevent and resolve conflicts. Many of the Secretary-General's proposals reflect the need for more efficient conflict prevention. In the case of the former Yugoslavia we have seen the devastating effects of doing too little too late. Let me recall Austria's proposal last year to dispatch peace-keeping forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina when there was still a peace to keep. Always  be it in Somalia  the Balkans or elsewhere  time-lags between the appearance of the first signs of a crisis and resolute decisions for preventive action prove to be costly in human lives  in destruction of property and in the loss of credibility of the international community. Peace-keeping operations must go beyond the mere observation of a cease-fire. In order to meet today's challenges  peace-keeping has to play a major role in conflict-prevention. Therefore  we support the Secretary-General's proposal envisaging the deployment of observers at the request of only one party to a conflict. Preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping operations  peace-making and peace-building will increasingly be among the main tasks of this Organization. Inter-ethnic strife will  unfortunately  continue to be the source of many conflicts in the future. We must all combine our efforts to improve the Secretariat's capacity to deal effectively with these challenges. The demands on the United Nations for peace-keeping and peace-building are increasing in numbers of operations and personnel  as well as in the scope of their mandates. We share the Secretary-General's concern about the need for Member States to make the necessary resources available. Austria  one of the largest troop-contributors over the years  is willing to increase its contribution  both for traditional tasks  in the form of providing military personnel  and for new tasks  in the form of assisting difficult transition processes  through the dispatch of civilian police  administrators and monitors of democracy. We have initiated a programme of meetings and seminars on inter-ethnic peace-keeping and training for peace-keeping  peace-making and conflict-prevention. Austria is now organizing a seminar on assisting and monitoring elections  with the aim of training officials for participation in future such United Nations missions.  At a time of excessive demands on limited United Nations resources and of the increasing political importance of regional arrangements  the Secretary-General's innovative approach of intensifying cooperation and coordination with regional organizations should be wholeheartedly pursued. Strengthening the bonds between the United Nations Secretariat and the relevant regional bodies calls for continuous contact and communication. In Europe the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) recently constituted itself a ""regional arrangement"" for matters of collective security  in conformity with the Charter. Its Vienna-based Conflict Prevention Centre will play an important role in future CSCE peace-keeping operations. The negotiations in Vienna within the framework of the CSCE Forum for Security Cooperation are particularly important for the development of confidence and for security-building and disarmament. In view of the proximity of the CSCE Secretariat in Prague and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw  both the United Nations and the CSCE would greatly benefit from the creation in Vienna of a mechanism for liaison between the European regional arrangements and the United Nations Secretariat. Such an institution  a foundation of peace-keeping operations  could make the combined efforts of all organizations more effective. At a time of limited resources it seems necessary for the Organization to make full use of all the facilities at its disposal world wide. Decentralization of the Secretariat must be seen as an asset for the Organization. No conflict illustrates more dramatically the utmost urgency of the need for implementation of the Secretary-General's proposals with regard to the continuing aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  a State Member of our Organization. The most fundamental principles on which the Charter is based are challenged: collective security  the non-use of force against territorial integrity and political independence  inviolability of borders  the rule of law  democracy  fundamental freedoms and human rights especially minority rights. In this regard  Bosnia and Herzegovina is a test case. If today aggression and ""ethnic cleansing"" are permitted there  tomorrow they may work in Sandzak  Kosovo  Vojvodina and Macedonia  and even in other parts of the world. The consequences would be unimaginable. Certainly  the international community has reacted to this aggression  to the atrocities and to the needs of the victims. Both the CSCE and the Security Council have clearly stated in various declarations and resolutions the responsibility of the Serbian Government for these acts and have demanded that they be brought to an immediate end. Cease-fires have been brokered  crucial humanitarian assistance has been organized  sanctions have been imposed and a political framework for a resolution of the conflict has been created. We owe a special tribute to all those courageous men who participate at enormous personal risk in the peace-keeping operations. We deeply regret the loss of human lives that has already occurred. It goes without saying that attacks against peace-keeping forces warrant our utmost condemnation  whether or not we know who might be responsible for such atrocious acts. During the last year many forums and organizations have adopted important declarations and resolutions dealing with this crisis. The London Conference produced a comprehensive plan of action  which could serve as a basis for a settlement. But have these plans and resolutions been implemented? What is needed is pressure  serious pressure  to make the aggressor desist from his acts in flagrant violation of international law in particular  humanitarian law and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. We must effectively rule out any possibility of not complying with the political commitments undertaken in London. This holds true for all the parties involved. The longer the conflict lasts  the greater the danger of violation of the most basic standards of human rights. In the context of this and other conflicts we should heed the Secretary-General  who on a general basis commends Article 42 of the Charter to the attention of all States; he says that under this Article ""... the Security Council has the authority to take military action to maintain or restore international peace and security."" (A/47/277. para. 43) Certainly  all peaceful means have to be employed to solve a conflict  but if they prove to be of no avail  and in the case of clear  gross violations of fundamental principles of the Charter  full application of all the Charter's provisions must be envisaged. That is the core and essence of a functioning system of collective security. The disappearance of the East-West confrontation that paralyses our Organization for so long gives us the chance to resurrect this system of collective security as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Organization. For the sake of mankind in the North and in the South  in the East and in the West of our globe we must not miss this chance. The objective fact of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia has been established in the convincing legal opinion handed down by the arbitration commission  chaired by President Robert Badinter. Consequently  Austria  along with many other countries  favours termination of the membership of ""Yugoslavia"" in all international organizations. We welcome the admission of Slovenia  Croatia  and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations. Ultimately all the successor States  including Serbia and Montenegro  have the right to be admitted as Members  provided that they comply with the established obligations of the Charter. Once the criteria established for the successor States of the former Yugoslavia by the Charter of Paris and by the peace conference have been met  the conditions will be in place for the admission of that State to the United Nations. We will continue to judge the real willingness of the authorities in Belgrade and other Serbian forces to honour their commitments and international obligations not by their words but by their actions. The international community will have to act most vigorously to oppose effectively the intolerable practice of ""ethnic cleansing"". I welcome the decisions of the Security Council  which has taken steps towards the establishment of security zones in Bosnia and Herzegovina to contain the mass expulsions  to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance and to secure the functioning of the legitimate Government. We must continue to work in this direction. The establishment of a no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina  as proposed by France  would supplement that measure and end the air attacks by the Serbian air force. The horrible effects of ""ethnic cleansing"" will have to be reversed. The aggressor cannot be allowed to enjoy the fruits of his aggression. The international community will have to do more than care for refugees and displaced persons: our goal must be to create conditions which would allow those who were expelled or displaced to return to their homes and to regain their belongings or be compensated for property destroyed. Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki  a hero of the liberation of Central and Eastern Europe  submitted  in his capacity as Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights  a report containing a number of proposals  which should be implemented as quickly as possible. I am thinking of the immediate necessity to disarm irregular armed forces and civilians  and the expansion of the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to be able to collect information on human rights violations and to deal with them. Another of Mr. Mazowiecki's important ideas is the creation of an investigative commission to determine the fate of the thousands of missing persons. At this point  let me express my firm conviction that ordinary people  both Serbs and Montenegrins  want prosperity and  first and foremost  peace. The abhorrent acts carried out under ""ethnic cleansing""  the torturing of innocent men and women in camps  the shelling of defenceless citizens: all these crimes are being ordered and carried out by individuals who cannot claim to act in the name of their people. Appropriate machinery must be established to enforce Security Council resolution 771 (1992) and to provide for - proceedings against all individual perpetrators punishable under international law  such as by creating an international penal tribunal for war crimes. Earlier this year the international fact-finding commission established under Additional Protocol I to the Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of the Victims of Armed Conflicts became operational. This commission could  also assume an important role to ensure the full implementation of the rules of international humanitarian law. Today the former Yugoslavia is suffering from the horrible ravages of  war. In a long-term perspective  economic recovery and concerted economic assistance will have to be a part of any peaceful solution for the region. Let me add here that Austria  long before the beginning of the process of the it disintegration of Yugoslavia  strongly advocated international assistance for the economic development of our neighboring country through various European organizations in order to promote reform  prosperity and democracy. Then as now our actions were motivated by a deep-felt desire to support economic and political reform for the sake of the well-being of all peoples living in the Balkan region  to which Austria is bound by strong ties of history. That is why I feel that I must make an urgent appeal for the mobilization of further financial means to bolster the humanitarian assistance necessary for the survival of the suffering populations. There can be no doubt that  with good will on both sides  questions and tensions arising from the cohabitation of different ethnic groups in the same area can be resolved in a process of cooperation. It is with the greatest satisfaction that I am today in a position to inform the General Assembly of the resolution  through political dialogue  of the controversy between Austria and Italy concerning the protection of the Austrian population in South Tyrol. This dispute originated in the different interpretations of the agreement signed by the two countries on 5 September 1946 in Paris. The issue was then addressed by the General Assembly in its resolutions 1497 (XV) and 1661 (XVI)  in 1960 and 1961. On this basis  Austria and Italy reached agreement on a package of 137 measures designed to benefit the population of South Tyrol - measures that Italy pledged to enact. At the beginning of this year further legal measures were adopted. On 19 June the two countries were able to inform the Secretary-General that the dispute which had been pending with the United Nations since 1960 had been settled. Austria and Italy have thus been able to provide the community of nations with a good example of how to resolve an ethnic conflict and how to guarantee and protect the rights and identities of minorities. The measures taken do indeed promise to provide a safe basis for the cultural  economic and social development of the German- and Ladin-speaking groups in South Tyrol  as they include sufficient legal safeguards at the national and international levels. The resolution of this controversy was greatly facilitated by a positive development in the political attitudes of all the parties involved in particular  by increased confidence between the State authorities and the ethnic groups. Although the protection of ethnic groups is clearly a dynamic process  the minority has to be assured that the Italian republic will respect its separate identity and will maintain the laws and regulations that have been created for the advancement of ethnic groups. Furthermore  the minority must be assured that its cultural bonds  based on common ethnic affiliation beyond the Italian frontier  will not be impeded in the future. If such confidence exists  the State will secure the loyalty of the minority. Confidence will also create an atmosphere conducive to better and intensified cooperation across the borders. Respect for human rights is a crucial requirement for the settlement of today's conflicts. The Austrian Government will take pride in hosting the World Conference on Human Rights to be convened in Vienna in June 1993. The invitation to host such an important event highlights Austria's dedication to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and in other international human-rights instruments have undeniably become universal standards. It is imperative that all members of the international community fulfil their voluntarily accepted obligations to promote and respect human rights  humanitarian law and democratic values. Human rights  democracy and development are inextricably linked and are of the utmost importance in an increasingly interdependent world. We shall continue to promote a comprehensive concept of human rights based also on different cultural traditions and encompassing civil and political  as well as economic and social  rights. There must not be a new North-South divide in the interpretation and application of human rights. Our unitary world requires consensus on this vital issue. In preparing for the Vienna conference  we shall strive for such consensus. I can assure the Assembly that the Austrian Government will spare no effort to contribute substantially to the preparatory process and that it will provide excellent facilities for the Conference. The Secretary-General has introduced the concept of an integrated approach by the United Nations to political  economic and social issues. Adequate economic and social development are prerequisites for international peace and security. The current and future status of the world social situation  the inclusion of vulnerable and socially disadvantaged groups in development  drug-abuse control and crime prevention rank high on the international agenda of an increasingly interdependent world. Peace and security are closely linked with economic and social development. We must take advantage of the end of the cold war to put more emphasis on issues of social and economic development. As the Secretary-General has said  the convening of a well prepared world social summit will remove a key aspect of current threats to global security. This summit should concentrate on three concrete issues: poverty  unemployment and social disintegration. The Austrian Government supports such a social summit. Good governance as a result of sound economic management and comprehensive social and environmental policies  as well as respect for human rights and democratic values  should be the basic objective of political leadership. While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development did not fully succeed in producing a comprehensive Earth charter or a clear commitment to protection of the world's forests  the agreements reached at Rio do represent a positive achievement. We must all share responsibility for care of our planet  and the developed countries must take the lead. This realization should give rise to a new quality in North-South relations. At Rio it became apparent that  in the long term  environmental protection and economic prosperity cannot be achieved at each other's expense. Ecology and the economy are not intrinsic foes; for the sake of our common well-being  and for the sake of future generations  they need to become very close allies. After Rio it is impossible to speak of protection of the environment without also addressing the development challenge. Nor is it possible to focus on development without taking into account the ecological dimension. Regarding the issue of international conflicts in the environmental sphere  I am very pleased to note that the Austrian proposal for the establishment of Green Helmets  submitted during the forty-fourth session of the General Assembly  has been favourably received. That Austrian initiative is reflected by the machinery provided for in the main Rio documents for preventing and settling such disputes. Rio demonstrated that the global problems of mankind cannot be solved by governments alone. Hence Austria welcomes the mobilization and the manifold contributions of the non-governmental organizations and the media. This level of involvement of groups and individuals must continue. The end of the East-West conflict and the growing awareness of the interdependence between North and South are leading to a new era for mankind. Regional cooperation offers new dimensions. There is a keen desire for preventive diplomacy. The resolution of ethnic conflicts is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Awareness of the interrelationship between development  environmental protection and the guaranteeing of human rights in the broadest sense of the term are on the increase. Let us work together to take advantage of all these opportunities. "
"10",400,"AZE",47,1992,"Anyone who has spoken from this rostrum will probably understand what my feelings are at this moment: there is both a feeling of pride in my people and my country  which have now set out along the road of independent development a right that does not come so easily and a sense of enormous responsibility for every word I say  for my words will be addressed to the whole world. And I hope they will be heard! All of us who have gathered here in this highly respected international forum  whatever our natural objective differences may be  have in common a single goal  that of achieving peace and security  and a single desire  to solve existing problems and prevent new ones from arising. Through our understanding that the world is interdependent in all its aspects  we have come to realize our necessary interest in overcoming difficulties  and that common interest has become the foundation of this transitional stage on the road towards the establishment of a new world order. All of us  I think  have already got over the euphoria of expecting rapid changes that were about to take possession of a world liberated from the chains of the cold war  and we have come to understand the depth of the problems confronting a human race which has gone to the limit in its search for new paths to development. Nobody is expecting easy victories. The situation in the world is undergoing fundamental and sometimes drastic changes. The military  political and economic confrontation between the two systems which had for a long time determined the balance of power in the world has come to an end with the collapse of one of them. What this has actually done is to destroy the foundation of international security  which had until then been intimidation and deterrence through parity of forces. A new system of world security must be created  one oriented on the new poles of power  the new roles of the super-Powers  new threats  new ways of waging war and new types of forces. The probability of a nuclear war has been reduced almost to zero  but the element of chance has increased; there are no safeguards against the occurrence of regional wars or against the unforeseen actions of State leaders or the consequences of those actions. These are all matters of serious concern to the Azerbaijani Republic  for no State can be secure on its own. Azerbaijan has no nuclear weapons on its soil and is not participating directly in the process of nuclear disarmament. Nevertheless  the Azerbaijani Republic is making its contribution by acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We are optimistic as a result of the implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe  to which Azerbaijan  along with other European States  has become a party. However  despite the achievements and successes of the disarmament process  military expenditures are  as before  absorbing a significant portion of State budgets at a time when such funds could be directed towards economic development. Arms stockpiling is  as before  a threat to security. One of the most important elements in military security is the openness or transparency of military programmes and activities. As a member of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  my country is participating in the development of this process. The move towards direct cooperation in the form of wide-ranging and intensive multilateral exchanges of information on military budgets and numbers  production levels  research  development and modernization programmes and weapons deployment and delivery plans seems to be a desirable one. Such openness will create an atmosphere of trust  make it easier to predict developments in the overall security situation  bolster stability and reduce the risk of war. During the long years of the East-West conflict it was usual for one side to arm the other's enemies. Today  when the threat of confrontation along East-West lines has gone  this so-called foreign-policy wisdom is likely to prove a significant danger to us all. Weapons proliferation is a serious challenge to international security and requires the world community to take active steps in order to ensure that it is limited and effectively controlled. Arms shipments  which are fraught with a fundamental potential for danger  are becoming a real factor capable of producing destructive effects on the situation in so-called hot spots. I hardly need explain how much trouble Azerbaijan has been caused by the weapons  including foreign-made weapons  being supplied  within Azerbaijani territory  by Armenian forces. We must encourage restraint on the part of arms suppliers; this will  of course  entail political difficulties. Limits could be placed on exports of arms to a particular country or region. It should be normal practice to declare arms transfers and to observe established limits  and the political complexion of the recipient must also be taken into account. The United Nations Register of conventional arms transfers will undoubtedly also play an important role in this regard. Given the attempts by certain countries to obtain weapons covertly  I would like to emphasize the extreme importance of having access to intelligence data on weapons proliferation and of observing suspicious regions and carrying out unannounced inspections there. In addition to the direct effects  these would increase States' confidence in the weapons non-proliferation regime. I believe that it would be appropriate to make efforts to establish subregional restraint regimes; this is particularly urgent for the multiplicity of hot spots which are appearing against the background of a minimal military threat on a Europe-wide scale. Subregional restraint could include reducing military force levels in limited geographically remote areas. Thereafter such regimes could lay the groundwork for the demilitarization of whole regions. Azerbaijan has already proposed this concept for the Transcaucasian region. The vacuum left by the disappearance of the Soviet Union from the military and political map of the world threatened to bring global disaster. However  we have survived that difficult period. In its death throes  the Soviet Union fortunately disintegrated; new sovereign States arose from its ruins and declared for all to hear that they were determined to join the community of democratic States based on law and with market economies. The United States of America and Russia  the two super-Powers  as they are still being called  have started to cooperate in the name of their common interests.  World developments of the last few years do indeed show that the democratic sphere is expanding. More and more countries want to be democratic  and regimes of other kinds are facing more and more difficulties. Of course  the development of democracy is a very difficult process whose ultimate goal  the establishment of an ideal system  is difficult to achieve; however  we can and must move forward towards that goal  by consolidating democratic values and institutions. And the core of the issue here is not merely adherence to ideals but the political and socio-economic rightness of the democratic system  whose effectiveness will very soon  I hope  become apparent in my country as well. There is in science a principle called dynamic evolutionary stability  according to which the elements of a system obey the same laws and move in the same direction. Any member of the system which tries to move in a direction different from the general trend is thrown out. And so it is in life. One cannot enter the world system and then follow a different programme and not observe the same rules as everybody else. Of course  the euphoria of national independence may prompt its own ""special"" path  but we know from history how such experiments end. What is the substance of the Azerbaijani Republic's national independence? Today new people have taken the helm  people free of the dogmas of the communist past  prepared to see the world as it is  without ideological masks  and striving for cooperation on the basis of common human values. These people have inherited the burdensome legacy of a repressive State which governed an obedient society  but that has only made their resolve to overcome it that much stronger. Our need for capable authorities which would see as their principal purpose the creation of the conditions for stimulating initiative and independence  which would act in the interests of the individual and would be rooted in the institution of citizenship  was forged in suffering. Our State policy is based on the interrelationship between the freedom and well-being of the individual and the security and prosperity of the State. Today the Government of the Azerbaijani Republic is facing the complex task of establishing legislative  political and socio-economic safeguards for the irreversibility of the democratic process. Newly independent States encounter a multitude of political  economic and social problems on their way to establishing themselves. They must face the difficult task of overcoming those problems within a cruelly short time-limit set by life itself. However  even that punishing pace at which the democratic authorities chosen by the people must act is intensified by threats and challenges of a different order which undermine States that are not yet standing on their own feet. I have in mind here what are called inter-ethnic conflicts  which are more political than ethnic in nature. There are no limits to the energy of a nation  which has become one of the driving forces of the development of mankind in the twentieth century. The explosive power of the energy of a national ego released from the fetters of many years of repression destroys the apparently unshakeable citadels of totalitarian regimes and opens up new prospects for people. However if that same power is placed at the service of an ugly  overblown nationalistic idea  it turns a people onto the path of war and drives it to aggression and expansion against another people chosen as its victim. An example of the first kind of national idea is the disintegration of that conglomeration of nations known as the USSR. An example of the second and a most accurate one - is the aggression of Armenia against Azerbaijan. To any action there is an opposite reaction. An aggressor dooms himself from the outset to failure  for he arouses against himself a people's natural reaction of self-defence  a force many times greater than the irrational force of aggression. Prosperity gained at another's expense cannot be long-lasting  even if it sometimes seems so. What is the result? Death and destruction  masses of destitute people on both sides  relations between States made difficult or broken off these are reflected many times in all spheres of human activity and threaten to escalate to new and more dangerous levels  involving other States and altering the regional or even the world balance. There is only one alternative: to end the aggression  if not voluntarily  then under the pressure of counter-force. Aggression must not go unpunished. Aggressors must be stopped. The importance of the international community's position on this issue cannot be overestimated. A timely  principled reaction by the international organizations  first and foremost by the United Nations and CSCE  is one of the guarantees that the required result will be achieved - that the aggression will be eliminated and therefore thousands of lives saved and that the conditions for States to develop peacefully will be established. The key idea that breaches of the peace are inadmissible is based on the fact that each State bears a high responsibility to the world community  and it presupposes a harmonization of national interests with the interests of all mankind. No one can dispute the right of a nation to the free choice of its path of development  but there are no rights without duties  and this is also true of nations  whose freedom of choice is controlled by their interrelationships with the world  as parts of the whole. Freedom does not mean irresponsibility. Violence of any kind  whatever its motivation or justification  is inadmissible. In our time the kind of nationalism that has nothing in common with national self-awareness has come close to being the greatest wellspring of violence. Sooner or later  that kind of nationalism finds the framework imposed on it by history constricting  and it starts to break out  violating other peoples' borders and infringing upon other peoples' interests. Today  having emerged from an ideologically divided world  we are facing the danger of dismemberment based on nationalistic grounds which feed the politics of separatism. The fact that the legal norms governing the right of peoples to self-determination  and even the meaning of the term  have not been fully worked out  either in domestic or in international law  has opened the door to widespread speculation on the subject on pseudo-democratic grounds  which are essentially a cover for forces harbouring plans to seize territory. We must make it clear  first of all  that the right of peoples to self-determination can be exercised solely by peaceful means; secondly  that the possessor of that right can be only a nation  not a national minority or an ethnic group; thirdly  that a people exercising its right to self-determination must not violate another people's right  its sovereignty or the integrity of its State. Making the discussion of the foregoing more concrete by projecting these conclusions onto the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict  I am compelled to say the following. The Republic of Armenia  having set the dismemberment of the Azerbaijani State and the seizure of its territories as the goal of its State policy  initiated the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh  an inseparable part of Azerbaijan  under cover of a demand for the right to self-determination for the Armenian population of that Azerbaijani region  whose borders  incidentally  have not been defined. There are no internal borders in the unitary Azerbaijani State. The region was split off administratively during the Stalin era  and it is the Armenian side that is so fervently demanding the elimination of the legacy of that time. I think there is no need to comment on the ill-intentioned substitution of the concept of ""people"" for that of ""national minority"". The Armenian people has already exercised its historic right to self-determination within the borders of the Republic of Armenia. With regard to the Armenian national minority which lives in Azerbaijan and has autonomy  the Azerbaijani Republic has repeatedly stated its readiness to guarantee that minority's rights in accordance with international norms  while justifiably expecting the Republic of Armenia to take suitable steps in respect of the Azerbaijani community which has lived for centuries in the territory of the present-day Republic of Armenia but has had no rights whatsoever and which  alas  has now been forced out of Armenia into Azerbaijan. The conflict  which is now a matter of concern to the world community  began with a blatant violation of the Azerbaijani Republic's sovereignty by Armenian separatists who  without holding any discussions with the Government of Azerbaijan  proclaimed their secession from the Azerbaijani Republic. They were supported by the Republic of Armenia  whose Parliament  in 1989  issued decrees on the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia  on including the budget of Nagorno-Karabakh in the Armenian budget and on the election of deputies from Nagorno-Karabakh to the Parliament of Armenia. Those decrees have not been annulled to this day and are in violation of the norms of international law. Such political infringements by the Republic of Armenia on Azerbaijan's sovereignty have since been backed up with practical measures aimed at implementing Armenia's declared plans to annex Azerbaijani territory. The use of force is  of course  unacceptable in settling disputes. Yet the actions of the Republic of Armenia  which initially took the form of covert aggression through the infiltration of separatists and terrorist gangs and delivering arms into Azerbaijan and which later turned into open aggression in the form of a direct armed incursion into Azerbaijan  the seizure of the city of Shusha and the Lachin district and the establishment of a land corridor joining occupied Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia  have naturally prompted a response from the armed forces of the Azerbaijani Government  which has the right and the duty to defend the interests of its citizens and its State  over 10 per cent of whose territory is now under Armenian occupation. Renouncing the use of force under these conditions could not prevent bloodshed. Inaction on the part of the Government would have provoked a movement from below  with the formation of self-defence forces whose actions would be spontaneous and therefore might have become uncontrollable. The Azerbaijani Republic  which has used military force only within its own frontiers and at a controlled level  the minimum level necessary to protect its sovereignty  has  from the very beginning of the conflict  called on the opposing side to cease hostilities and to settle existing problems at the negotiating table. It is continuing today to confirm its readiness for peaceful dialogue by taking specific measures aimed at reaching a compromise. However  Azerbaijan's efforts were met each time with silence on the part of the Republic of Armenia  which continues to make demands that are contrary to international law. One can hardly expect political leaders who rose to power on a wave of ideas of nationalism and the establishment of a Greater Armenia to abandon those positions  because it would mean their political death. But holding that line will lead to a catastrophe incomparably greater than the disappearance of the politicians from the arena. The present leadership of the Republic of Armenia should realize that the path they have chosen is a deadly one; Armenia will never be a democratic State while it carries the burden of this conflict. Democracy cannot be built on a foundation of nationalism  on flouting laws  on bloodshed and suffering. This whole train of events gives us solid grounds for viewing Armenia's position with regard to peaceful settlement and international mediation merely as an attempt to gain time for consolidation in the Azerbaijani territories Armenia has forcibly seized  so that it can subsequently obtain agreement on a political solution from a position of fait accompli. But there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement. Decisive steps must be taken to clear the obstacles from the road to peace. A necessary condition for this is the withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from Azerbaijan  since that would establish a real foundation for a stable cease-fire under international supervision  for the return of refugees to their homes and the normalization of life in the war-torn areas  including safeguards for the rights of the Armenian national minority living in Azerbaijan. Despite all the complications and obstacles  the peaceful settlement process initiated by CSCE and followed up by CSCE's Minsk Group under the chairmanship of Mr. Rafaelli  for whose efforts I am sincerely grateful  both to him personally and to the Government of Italy  must achieve the desired result: an end to the aggression and the senseless bloodshed  the liberation of occupied Azerbaijani areas  the development of a peaceful dialogue between the two States and the solution of existing internal problems on a reciprocal basis. The national minorities in Armenia and Azerbaijan must become not pawns in a dispute but guarantees of each other's security and of respect for each other's interests  and  in the future  a bridge for cooperation. I hold this optimistic view because I have faith in the reasonableness of two peoples and two States that have lived side by side for centuries and whose history has earned them the right to peace  prosperity and good-neighbourly relations. I hope that the Republic of Armenia will come to realize the importance of such concepts as good neighbours  friendship and mutual assistance  which have deep roots in our region. The concrete example of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict enables us to draw certain conclusions that are related and applicable to other regional conflicts similar in nature to the one I have mentioned. The world we live in is very fragile; thus our approach to the principles governing global coexistence  hammered out by the experience of human civilization  should be very cautious. Those principles include  first of all  the sovereignty of States  their territorial integrity and the inviolability of their borders; they also include the inadmissibility of securing one's interests at the expense of those of others. Such a course cannot bring independence  democracy or prosperity to any State. Everything in the world is interrelated. The words spoken and the actions taken by some politicians in defence of human rights  national minorities  and nationhood can sometimes threaten the most fundamental right - the right to life. When blood is being shed  it is pointless to talk about the rights of national minorities. I have said it before and now say it again: The sovereignty of the State begins with the sovereignty of the individual. Respect for human rights is not part of a State's internal affairs but its obligation. The safeguarding of rights and fundamental freedoms is the main guarantee of a State's prosperous development. Returning to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict  I must point out that our approach is based precisely on this understanding and that Armenians living in Azerbaijan are just as much citizens of this State as Azerbaijanis  Russians  Jews  Kurds  Lezghians  Talishes or Poles. But there are no rights without obligations. The State is the guarantor of individual freedom; the individual is the guarantor of the State's security. The defence of human rights - and of the rights of national minorities as part of those rights cannot be implemented to the detriment of State sovereignty. External influence and interference are sometimes hard to distinguish  and crossing the fine line that separates them can lead to disaster. Sometimes the non-use of external force can have great benefits. Problems of this kind have various political  social  and economic causes  and sometimes a State trying to solve the problem cannot instantly unravel the tangle of causes and effects. It is a lengthy process requiring a delicate approach in which the underlying principle must be: ""Do no harm"". In such circumstances a State has the right to count on the assistance and experience of the world community. Working to improve the State from within will have more effect than pressure from without. Every State has its share of responsibility to the outside world  expressed as its duty to observe accepted norms and obligations. A question of practical interest today is that of the further elaboration in international law of the principle of sovereignty  with due regard for the increased international responsibility of States. Bringing national legislation into conformity with international law  a process which creates the necessary regimes of rights and freedoms of the individual  is of the greatest importance in this context. Such a process has already been initiated in Azerbaijan. The priority of international legal norms over national ones is enshrined in the constitutional act of State independence of 18 October 1991. To conclude this subject  I should like to point out that our common progress in that direction must emphasize the harmonization of the interests of mankind and national interests. One of the main factors for stability in society  particularly during a transitional period  serving in a sense as a guarantee of the irreversibility of democratic reforms  is a healthy and developed economy. Unfortunately  I must state that today the economy of Azerbaijan has fallen on hard times. The legacy of the Soviet past and the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict are taking their toll. The failure of the centralized planning system further strengthened our confidence in the viability of the market economy. The Parliament and Government of the Republic  committed to rapid reform  are working hard for the legislative and programmed introduction of economic changes that should accelerate the process of market formation and integrating Azerbaijan into the world economy on an equitable and mutually beneficial footing. The world economy has not yet succeeded in surmounting a number of obstacles  foremost among which  to my mind  is the disproportion in economic development. It is believed that  in spite of all the problems of the world economy  whose number increased sharply with the collapse of the Soviet system  the end of the ideological confrontation between the two poles of power has given a positive impetus to the formulation of new approaches in the developed world towards the problems of developing countries. Participation in international economic organizations and United Nations economic agencies  with the concomitant opening of a wide range of possibilities for multilateral economic cooperation  is a matter of high priority for Azerbaijan. Definite hopes for instituting economic reforms in Azerbaijan are being placed in financial assistance and consultative technical assistance that could be provided under special programmes. The United Nations  an office of which is to be opened at Baku in the near future  should play an active role in this. However  I should like to express my regret concerning the position of certain States in whose policy the provision of assistance to young democratic States is linked to particular political objectives that are  in our view  of a subjective nature. Refusal to provide assistance may not only fail to promote the development of the reform process but also create new problems for the establishment of democracy in young States. The consequences of such ill-considered steps could be far more serious than the reasons that motivated the refusal. The warfare initiated by the Republic of Armenia against Azerbaijan has created a social tragedy in my country. About 500 000 Azerbaijanis have been deprived of the basic necessities of life; 230 000 of them were expelled from the areas of Armenia in which they had historically resided  and the rest have become refugees as a result of Armenia's direct aggression against Azerbaijan. Our Government has encountered enormous difficulties in meeting their needs. I should like to express my hope that the United Nations will not leave Azerbaijan to deal with this disaster alone and that it will provide all possible assistance. The ecological situation  which has been gradually deteriorating throughout the world  is becoming the greatest threat of all. Nature is calling attention to its problems with increasing urgency through new environmental disasters and tragedies. The problem of structural reform of the global economy on a basis that is environmentally sound still remains unsolved. The contribution of the United Nations in this field - demonstrated inter alia in the convening of the Conference on Environment and Development deserves particular mention here. That Conference was a valuable example of collective efforts to solve humanity's problems. My country cannot boast of a favourable ecological situation. The condition of the Caspian Sea is tragic  showing the effect of all the ills of a planned economy and of its consumption-oriented attitude towards nature. We firmly intend to make every effort to save this unique natural ecosystem  and we hope that our efforts will be supported by assistance from the world community. The primary mechanism of world development at present is international cooperation. I believe that we can solve our problems only in that context. I am also convinced that the process of strengthening cooperation will continue to evolve. Naturally  such evolution is directly related to the growing importance and prestige of the United Nations. Our Organization has a special role in international relations  which are undergoing radical changes. The United Nations has been  is and always will be the world forum in matters of justice and law  the stronghold of the civilized norms of life and the highest authority in the settlement of international disputes. The growing effectiveness of the Organization as a factor for security  stability and cooperation illustrates that fact. New conditions and changes in the world situation require readjustments  including structural ones. Special attention should be given to the development of structures and means for preventive diplomacy  early warning of crisis situations and the improvement of means for averting acts of aggression. The United Nations should have the capacity to protect its Member States more decisively and effectively from violations of their sovereignty  taking action up to and including enforcement measures against the aggressor. Cooperation with regional organizations on the basis of mutual support will  I believe  promote greater effectiveness of United Nations peace-keeping and peacemaking activities. United Nations structures should be brought as close as possible to the problems which the Organization intends to resolve. Everything should serve to increase the efficiency of United Nations activities as a mechanism for security and cooperation. I am firmly convinced that the ship of the United Nations  guided by the strong hand of its captain  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a man of wisdom and decisiveness as befits a true captain  will keep to the necessary course  the only true course  and  as the flagship of the world community  carry it to the shores of peace and prosperity. The forty-sixth session of the General Assembly was significant for the Azerbaijani Republic  when it was admitted as a Member of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the President of the Assembly at its forty-sixth session  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for his contribution to our common cause and especially for his sensitivity and warmth towards the new Members of the Organization. I hope that the current  forty-seventh session  under the presidency of Mr. Stoyan Ganev  will bring us closer to our common goals. I wish Mr. Ganev success in that position of responsibility. May every day of this session be a day of constructive solutions of our common problems. May new difficulties which  alas  life will always throw in our way not weaken our faith  nor discourage us on our long and thorny path. We conquer the road as we walk along it. "
"11",446,"BDI",47,1992,"For me it is a great pleasure and an agreeable duty to participate in the work of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. For almost half a century the United Nations has been working to lead mankind to the more human condition of peace and international solidarity. Allow me to take this early opportunity to discharge the duty an honour given to me by Major Pierre Buyoya  President of the Republic of Burundi of conveying to Mr. Ganev  the President of the General Assembly at its current session  a message of peace and solidarity  in keeping with the fundamental purposes set out in the Charter. Allow me also  on behalf of my delegation  my Government and the people of Burundi  to join other representatives in congratulating Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency. There is no doubt that his distinguished qualities  together with his rich experience  will lead to the success that everyone expects of our deliberations. Our congratulations go also to the members of the General Committee  who  I am sure  will spare no effort to support the President in the discharge of his responsibilities. At the same time I express our very good wishes to Mr. Ganev's eminent predecessor as President  who conducted the work of the General Assembly at its forth-sixth session with remarkable competence. Furthermore  I should like to pay a very well deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his determination to see that peace and security in the world are preserved. The Republic of Burundi warmly welcomes the countries that have just joined the family of the United Nations. Mankind is going through a period of contrasts. Current events are characteristic of the transition from one era to another. Indeed  the world gives the impression that it is seeking a new balance  which  we hope  will enable men and women to live together more harmoniously. Whereas the ending of the cold war and the remarkable disarmament efforts have resulted in significant progress in the field of international security  bloody conflicts continue to tear the planet apart. While a series of events  of which everyone is aware  is persuading peoples to work together to achieve economic and even political integration  nations are being torn apart by very bloody fratricidal conflicts. One has only to consider the extremely worrying situation in Somalia to realize that the world is still a theatre for tragedies that one cannot bear to watch. In recent years the winds of liberty have been blowing throughout the world  and all nations have been rising up in a crusade for human rights and the dignity of the human person  yet men and women continue to be deprived of elementary rights the right to life  the right to a homeland and the right to development. This is the case in South Africa  where apartheid  even in its death throes  continues to claim victims  and where people  here and there  continue to be deprived of a homeland. While steady scientific progress is enabling mankind to master natural forces and is preparing him to subdue other planets  men and women continue to wallow in deprivation. This is especially true of the African continent  where ignorance  hunger and sickness still reign on a grand scale. The picture so eloquently presented by Abdou Diouf in his capacity as President of the Organization of African Unity fully conveys the concerns of Africa and of Africans  and we agree completely with what he said. At the Rio Conference the international community took a major step in its awareness of the need to preserve the quality of the environment on Earth  which is our common home. Paradoxically  however  as we seek means of subsistence we continue to destroy things that we need to enable us to live and breathe. This becomes more and more evident when we look at the intimate relationship between the environment and development a relationship that the Rio Conference very rightly set out for us. We are living in an era of paradox. On one hand  it seems that the world has been moving ahead at full speed in terms of peace and security  freedom  well-being and progress  but  on the other hand  we are witnessing war  poverty  hunger and misery. In these conditions mankind has no chance of making progress. Thus the objectives set out in the Charter of the United Nations are still relevant. In this the last decade of the twentieth century we must show that we are determined to preserve international peace and security. We must also demonstrate greater solidarity  as an injury to the little finger causes suffering to the entire body. Like the illustrious founders of this Organization  we must proclaim our faith in a better world and must turn the United Nations into an Organization capable of maintaining international peace and security and of ensuring justice and respect for human rights. Moreover  the Organization must be able  in accordance with its Charter  to promote social progress and better standards of life for all peoples of the world. The Republic of Burundi therefore pays a tribute to all those who are striving daily to maintain peace in the world and welcomes the signs of solidarity whereby all peoples may be enabled to live life to the full  in keeping with the aspirations and values that underlie the United Nations. In that connection  the report ""An Agenda for Peace"" submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary-General deserves the international community's close attention. For its part  the Republic of Burundi reiterates its faith in the United Nations Charter and its commitment to work with the international community in achieving the triumph of its ideals. The rostrum of the United Nations  which is provided to us each year  is a special place for dialogue and exchanges of views that enable us better to understand one another and share our experiences. Allow me  therefore  briefly to share with representatives the principal paths that my country has decided to take in rebuilding and making its modest contribution to the realization of the Organization's goals. In the not-too-distant past my country went through some tragic experiences caused by continuing divisive conflicts  essentially ethnic. They were followed by tragedies that resulted in loss of human life and a large exodus of refugees seeking asylum in neighbouring countries and elsewhere in the world. That situation had a serious effect on social relations. Rancour  mistrust and hatred took root in the hearts of brothers and sisters who should have been living together in a single  age-old nation. It was in this context an uneasy one  to say the least that on 3 September 1987 the people of Burundi rose up to change the unhappy course of their history. Five years later  I am pleased to announce that Burundi is once again a united nation. Indeed  with the proclamation of the Third Republic  Burundi has turned the page and is now embarked upon the construction of a new society of peace  justice and social harmony. Under the dynamic and farsighted leadership of Major Pierre Buyoya  President of the Republic  the people of Burundi are in the process of burying once and for all the quarrels and divisions from which they have suffered for so long. To achieve that goal  the Government has based its actions on three fundamental factors: national reconciliation  democratization and development. First  the people of Burundi set out to realize internal reconciliation. To remove the divisions that had rent the fabric of Burundi society  the people determined  with a supreme effort  to pull themselves together and experience the forgiveness of national reconciliation. Witness to this is the proclamation of faith contained in the Charter of National Unity  in which Burundis  with historic conviction  stated: ""We are determined to break with the past and to embark upon a new era in order to build a more promising future free of hatred and mistrust."" The national reconciliation now achieved has been the result of a complete process. The first requirement was to engage in an examination of conscience  which inspired Burundis to join together and to tell themselves the truth. That process began with the establishment of a National Commission made up of citizens of all ethnic groups  all regions and all religious and socio-professional sectors. The Commission's task was to diagnose the disease of division and then to propose appropriate cures. After seven months of arduous work the Commission submitted a report setting forth an analysis of the situation and proposals for a better future. However  as President Buyoya has so pertinently said  the construction and deepening of a people's unity cannot be accomplished by the President of the Republic alone  nor by his Government. Therefore  based on the Commission's report  a national debate on the important question of national unity was organized among ill sectors of society. In making such a thorough examination of a subject so long taboo  the people of Burundi has discovered the virtues of dialogue and joint effort  elevated into a form of government. The national debate was crowned with the creation of the Charter of National Unity  which was adopted with the support of more than 89 per cent of the population in a referendum held on 5 February 1991. Since that time the Charter of National Unity has become the pre-eminent point of reference for all of the nation's political life and a pact by which all Burundis have sealed an alliance to consolidate their regained unity. With the Charter we  the people of Burundi have proclaimed our faith in lasting national unity and condemned and forever rejected all divisions of any kind. We have thus committed ourselves to uprooting from our society any tendency to violence  physical extermination and vengeance. More positively  we have committed ourselves to rigorous respect for the ethic of national unity. This is translated into respect for human life  the promotion of justice and the safeguarding and consolidation of peace and security. In parallel with that process  which was aimed principally at reconciling hearts and minds  the process of consolidating national unity has been marked by a series of specific measures undertaken with a concern to administer the State in keeping with the ethic of national unity. In October 1988 the President of the Republic established a new Government called the Government of National Unity  whose composition reflects the concern of high-level State authorities to bring all elements of society into the management of public affairs. The Government has the political mission of stimulating a new spirit in all sectors of national life. At every level of society responsibilities have been entrusted to citizens from all walks of life  without any discrimination whatsoever. In this undertaking the Government has given pride of place to other values cherished by the Third Republic: equality of all citizens  the cult of excellence and total transparency in the management of public affairs. With national unity regained and national reconciliation an accomplished fact  we are able give all due attention to grappling with the thorny problem of refugees. Everyone agrees that the fact that there are so many millions of refugees throughout the world is a result of internal or inter-State conflicts that Governments have been powerless to resolve. Furthermore  the international community owes a big debt to the refugees  inasmuch as its inability to manage harmoniously has led to the violation of a basic human right  the inalienable right to live somewhere in one's homeland  with no risk of having no home. Fortified by those convictions  and having laid the foundations for domestic peace  the Government of the Republic of Burundi has undertaken a vast programme of voluntary repatriation for Burundi refugees. It feels that voluntary repatriation is by far the best lasting solution to the refugee question. Thus  in carrying out this work of national reconciliation our country's highest bodies have offered those of our compatriots who have gone into exile the opportunity to return freely to their country. In so doing  our ambition is to see that soon no Burundians will be living with the degrading label of refugee. From this rostrum and before the entire international community  I should like to repeat what Major Pierre Buyoya  President of the Republic  said  and solemnly reiterate my Government's appeal to all refugees from Burundi  wherever they may be  to freely return to their homeland. We shall welcome them with open arms. I am pleased to note at this point that the results already achieved in this programme are extremely encouraging. In 1988  following the unrest that disrupted peace and security in two of our communities  we succeeded in repatriating approximately 50 000 people who had moved to neighbouring countries. Thanks to the assistance of the international community  we were able without difficulty to set them up again on their own land  to build new homes for them and to help reintegrate them into our production networks. In that same spirit  my Government is continuing to welcome those of the refugees who left their country some 20 years ago that freely choose to return. Even as we speak  more than 25 000 of them have already returned home  and others continue to arrive. Thanks to national and international solidarity  those who were repatriated have rejoined society in complete dignity. The Government has made an inventory of all available lands that could accommodate them  and they are being given assistance that allows them to meet their needs until they can subsist on the fruits of their own labour. In collaboration with local administrative authorities  they are receiving all the help necessary to build a decent home  and they even have health insurance so that they can easily obtain health care. Their children have been integrated into the school system  and those among the repatriated who have some training are receiving all the help needed to secure a position in the work force. I take this opportunity to thank the countries and the organizations that have supported us in carrying out this programme  and we also appeal to the international community to continue to help us in this process  of which my people are so proud. In sealing this pact of national unity  the people of Burundi placed special emphasis on the absolute need to see to it that the management of the State is democratically assured. That is why  in keeping with the consolidation of national unity  Burundi has undertaken to democratize our institutions. I would be remiss not to share with the Assembly information about the steps that my country has taken. This was for us an original move  and we have every reason to be satisfied with it. Indeed  in this process as well as in the one that led to national reconciliation  the Government has always been careful to involve all segments of the population. Through frank and sincere dialogue with the people  the political class has always been honest and wise enough to put itself in the hands of the people  being convinced that no work can last unless the citizens are involved  for in the final analysis they are the ones who do the work and who benefit from all changes. Thus  throughout all of last year the people were closely involved with drawing up a new constitution  which was subsequently adopted by referendum on 9 March 1992 by more than 90 per cent of the population. The new constitution establishes a multiparty system and gives special attention to respect for fundamental human rights. In this way  Burundi has put an end to 26 years of a single-party system and has restored order  serenity and national harmony. Since that time  the Government has worked to implement the guidelines contained in the constitution. The process of effectively implementing pluralism was accelerated in such a way that today  seven political parties are already on the political scene. Appropriate legislation was also passed promptly to promote the right to free association and freedom of the press  which are indispensable foundations for a vital multiparty system. In terms of human rights  independent leagues have been established. In this particular area  which is very dear to us  we have just established a centre for the promotion of human rights whose mission is to instil into society  through teaching and various means of communication  the values that underlie respect for human dignity. In Burundi  the democratization of our institutions is therefore proceeding in this manner  and the Government is strongly determined to keep moving forward. That is why  in keeping with the guidelines that the President has already laid down  the Government is planning to hold general elections in the early months of 1993. Once the constitution has clearly defined the institutional structure that is to guide the country and the competing partners  that is  the political parties  are on the scene  we believe that it would be a reprehensible step backwards to prolong this period of transition indefinitely. Our intention is to give to a sovereign people the opportunity to speak  so that they can democratically elect the leaders of their choice. We do so in what we term the Burundi way  that is to say in complete openness  through dialogue and joint efforts. I should not like to take advantage of your kind attention. Sir. None the less  I should be remiss if  before ending my statement  I did not mention what we consider to be a pillar of unity and democracy that is  development. I should not like to take advantage of your kind attention. Sir. None the less  I should be remiss if  before ending my statement  I did not mention what we consider to be a pillar of unity and democracy that is  development. Speaking of national unity  we say that unity and development are inseparable realities and that it would be difficult to achieve one without the other. The same is true of democracy. Indeed  without enjoying the public freedoms that are the structure of true democracy  people cannot fully express their creativity. Similarly  democratic freedoms that are not based on the satisfaction of elementary human needs would only be wishful thinking and would rapidly become void of any substance. Following these principles  the Government has undertaken a series of programmes of action for development. For a country such as ours  development is not a difficult concept to define. Essentially  it boils down to satisfying the basic needs of the population  such as drinking water  health services  schooling for their children  decent homes and also food security. To succeed in this development enterprise  the authorities of the third Republic initiated a structural adjustment programme with the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Implementation of the programme is intended to stabilize the finances of our country and to transform our productive structures with a view to achieving economic growth. This reform  moreover  is guided by the principles of good management of public affairs and of liberalizing the economy. In so doing  important efforts have been made to promote the private sector. This new manner of conducting development emphasizes the growing disengagement of the State and the giving of responsibility to individuals and corporations. In this framework  the Government has  since 1991  embarked on a major economic programme to privatize public enterprises. What is involved is the partial or total opening up of public enterprises to private capital. It also involves restructuring those enterprises that need it in order to be more profitable and to establish more effective mechanisms for managing them. The liberalization of Burundi's economy has just entered a new stage with the creation of a free trade zone regime. This reform  intended to promote investment in order to bring about the diversification of our exports  grants tax and other advantages which some consider to be among the most advantageous in the world. Investors who so desire can come and work with us. I can guarantee that they will not regret doing so. The political reforms that have taken place within the framework of strengthening national unity and of democratization of institutions have created in our country a political and social environment which is very favourable to business. I have given a thumbnail sketch of the situation in Burundi today. As I indicated at the beginning of my statement  the Government and people of Burundi are working to achieve national reconciliation. The steps we have taken allow us to welcome our brothers and sister who were refugees and enable them to regain their dignity by returning freely to their homeland. Thanks to the national unity we have regained  the democratization of our institutions is also taking place in an atmosphere of peace  order and serenity. We have committed ourselves to ambitious development programmes in order to establish an environment and a social infrastructure that can support social peace. In this way  in full cooperation with the international community  Burundi feels that it is 01 the right path  one which will allow it  moreover  to make its contribution t) building a better world of peace  security and international solidarity. This is the best inheritance we could leave to our children. How could we not in chis United Nations body give some thought to the children  who are the future of us all? This is why we wish especially to recall that today  30 September 1992  marks the second anniversary of the World Summit for Children. We express to the Secretary-General our appreciation for the report (A/47/264) he has just submitted to us on the follow-up to the Summit. It deserves our attention. We should also like to take this opportunity to say that we have high hopes that the forthcoming conference on this subject  which is to take place in Dakar  Senegal  next November will study the issue of the future of Africa's children. "
"12",493,"BEL",47,1992,"Allow me first of all to congratulate you warmly. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. Through your person  an entire region of the world affirms in this forum its political renewal. The body of Members of our Organization is growing continually. Over the last year  21 new States have come to join our ranks and have subscribed to the commitments of the Charter. We bid them welcome. Belgium has always held the view that our Organization should be open to all States. Equally strong  however  is our conviction that expansion should not come to mean shattering and dispersal. National aspirations must remain subordinate to the essential prerequisites of multilateral cooperation  which is becoming more necessary every day. In this respect  the confidence Belgium placed in the new Secretary-General even before his election has turned out to be fully justified. As proof of this  I would refer to his actions in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. I have also in mind his analyses at the Rio Conference  his report on preventive diplomacy and his report to the General Assembly. My colleague  the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom  has already spoken on behalf of the member States of the European Community. This allows me to concentrate my statement on a few issues of particular concern to us. The end of the cold war made strengthened international cooperation both possible and necessary. For combined reasons of history  size and geographical location  Belgium has always been predisposed to cooperation. Without a credible international order  we will all sooner or later be faced with an upsurge of unilateral demands containing the seeds of inevitable threats to peace. Our membership of the Security Council has enabled us to witness this first hand. A United Nations which functions effectively constitutes the best guarantee against such dangers. The end of the cold war has produced a variety of results. A wall has fallen but new trenches have been dug. The elimination of global ideological confrontation has led to the easing of regional conflicts that were fuelled by that confrontation. But it has also released frustrations  which have often degenerated into parodies of the right to self-determination and into new conflicts. We must react to this. Fortunately  the United Nations is no longer paralysed by the automatic ideological antagonisms of the past. The Security Council in particular has regained its means of action and its authority  which is now broadly recognized. Failure to comply with its decisions now equals isolation from the international community. But precisely because our Organization is experiencing something of a revival  we have to ensure that it does not fall victim to its own success. The summit meeting of the Security Council members  held last January  recognized the extent of this challenge. The Heads of State or Government requested the Secretary-General to develop concrete proposals to respond to it. The Secretary General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  has given us ample food for thought on the future role of the Organization. The report confirms that our central objective should be peace first and foremost  for without peace  neither normal society nor faith in the future of individuals is possible. The General Assembly will debate preventive diplomacy in depth. We hold this concept to be based on the following elements: full use of the powers vested in the Secretary-General; a United Nations presence in the initial stages of a potential conflict; the specific role of regional organizations; commissions of inquiry and temporary observer missions; an enlarged role for United Nations staff already present in potential conflict zones; and disarmament and non-proliferation. Disarmament and non-proliferation continue to merit special attention in their own right. The end of the cold war has made the control and monitoring of conventional weapons more difficult. The nightmare of global nuclear confrontation has given way to the threat of the unchecked proliferation and dissemination of nuclear arms and technology. During the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  the 12 countries of the European Community  together with Japan  took an initiative which has led to the creation of a register for multilateral control of the transfer of conventional weapons. That  however  is but a first step. The case of Iraq has demonstrated the extent of the problems caused by a lack of transparency in commercial transactions involving both conventional and nuclear weaponry. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should therefore continue to improve its system of safeguards  preventive detection and monitoring of the transfer of dual-use items. I would like to pay a tribute here to the steadfast efforts of the Conference on Disarmament. Belgium currently chairs that Conference and will present to the General Assembly the draft Convention on a ban on chemical-weapons. On behalf of a country victimized by these weapons during the First World War  I want to launch a solemn appeal in favour of the universal acceptance of the draft Convention  resulting in the final elimination of these particularly barbaric weapons from all arsenals.* A more systematic use of preventive diplomacy would  no doubt  enable us to limit at least the human cost of conflicts. However  it is clear that when prevention reaches its limits  the Organization must be able to resort to other peace-keeping measures. In response to the appeals of the Secretary-General  Belgium  for its part  has dispatched a battalion to Croatia and units to Bosnia and Herzegovina  and is preparing a battalion for deployment in Somalia. The financial difficulties of our Organization have led us recently to seek alternative financing systems. However  I must take this opportunity to recall the obligation of solidarity that applies to all Member States. All Members must fulfil their budgetary obligations. The system for financing peace-keeping operations should be uniform and predictable  and should resolve the problems of financing the initial phases of urgent operations. The United Nations would obviously lose both operational capacity and credibility if the Organization were denied the budgetary resources corresponding to its responsibilities. However  all the combined tools of preventive diplomacy  disarmament  non-proliferation and peace-keeping operations are not sufficient to ensure real peace. Most conflicts are more deeply rooted. I wholeheartedly agree with the Secretary-General's broad interpretation of the elements which contribute to ensuring peace. Like him  I believe that the role of the Organization extends to the prevention of tensions of any kind  be they economic disparities  infringements of human rights  the absence of democracy or environmental degradation. For the first generations of the post-colonial era  the term ""North-South dialogue"" kept alive the hope of attaining a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities. The situation today is far from meeting those expectations. This is the combined result of the cold war and military expenditure  of a degree of selfishness in the North  of corruption and bad governance  and of a wrong choice of priorities both in the South and the North. For these reasons  major bilateral and multilateral aid efforts have sometimes failed and have also maintained a culture of dependency which now demands a process of emancipation. The contrasts between North and South demand our attention more than ever. We are witnessing  on the one hand  a race to satisfy material cravings  and on the other  abject poverty. This is the greatest challenge facing us. We not only have to maintain important resource and technology transfers  but we also need to make a frank analysis of past errors and to identify the real priorities. In this context two factors have  in my view  become of key importance: first  the concept of global interdependence and  secondly  the growing emphasis on the close links between population  environment and development. Useful lessons may be drawn from past disappointments concerning donor-recipient relationships. The Assembly will also discuss the triennial policy review of the operational activities of the United Nations system. We hope that this will be a thorough debate leading to a genuine reassessment of multilateral aid mechanisms. For our part  we have launched a number of innovations in our bilateral aid during recent years. These include  in particular  the creation of joint management systems for our development projects  designed to reinforce the decision-making capacity of our partners. Nevertheless  a real economic take-off will be possible only if investments follow government efforts. We note with satisfaction that a number of developing countries have taken steps to offer greater legal security to foreign investors with respect to freedom of enterprise  fiscal matters and mobility of capital and profits. Such measures contribute to the creation of a better investment climate. We have to concern ourselves now more than ever with the social aspects of development. Profit is not a goal in itself. Income redistribution must allow for the full personal development of every individual within a society based on solidarity. This solidarity must extend to future generations. The rights of workers  as well as their families  their cultural heritage and their environment  must therefore be protected. The World Conference on Social Development  to be held in 1995  will provide us an opportunity to give these goals and principles the high priority they deserve. International economic cooperation can flourish only on the basis of political will and effective mechanisms. This explains the vital importance of several international negotiating processes  either in progress or already being finalized  being brought to a successful conclusion. I should like to stress Belgium's attachment to the liberalization of world trade as a driving force for economic growth and development. The success of the Uruguay Round is the essential precondition for this. Finally  the Rio de Janeiro Conference was a milestone in the process of increasing collective awareness of the future of our planet  and Belgium will attach the greatest importance to its follow-up. One of the crucial aspects here concerns the financial mechanisms. We earnestly wish for a strengthening of the structure of the global environment facility to adapt it better to the various needs. This should also contribute to a greater convergence between the international financial institutions of the Bretton Woods system and the operational mechanisms of the United Nations family. I could not possibly close this part of my statement without mentioning the economic problems of a region to which we feel particularly close  namely Africa. Current events are continually giving us cause for concern. Belgium  however  refuses to give in to visions of catastrophe or what a fashionable phrase defines as ""Afro-pessimism"". In recent years Belgium has redefined its attitude and its commitments towards Africa  first in areas where we could have to assume special responsibilities. We warmly welcome the fact that the link between democracy  human rights and development is now widely recognized and applied. We hope that democratization will be understood at its true value  namely  for the benefit of the people. The spirit which inspires us is not that of a new paternalism: we wish to enter into cooperation as equal partners. In order to support political renewal in Africa  my Government has just created a fund to assist in the financing of democratic elections  the main beneficiary of which will be the African continent. Furthermore  Belgium is actively using its influence with its partners and in relevant international institutions to ensure that the dawning of democracy is accompanied by an upturn in economic activity. In the meantime  we have intensified our emergency aid in several areas affected by conflict or natural disasters. My Government also welcomes the fact that  as regards aid to Africa  it has established a fruitful working relationship with Belgian and international non-governmental organizations. Failure to respect the rights of the individual is another source of tension and violence  as well as an impediment to economic and social progress. We must clearly reaffirm the principle of the universality of basic rights and freedoms which are inherent in human dignity. These rights cannot be subject to various interpretations. Respect for and the protection of human rights require stronger monitoring mechanisms. An extraordinary session of the Human Rights Commission took place last month in Geneva. The Commission strongly condemned the serious and intolerable human rights abuses taking places in the former Yugoslavia. Belgium warmly welcomes this rapid reaction and would like to see it serve as an example in the future. Belgium would also like to see the coming World Conference on Human Rights lead to a reaffirmation of the international commitments by States and a strengthening of cooperation in the world community. We appeal to all countries to strive in a constructive spirit for the success of this Conference. We are already in favour of a role for the Security Council in certain cases of particularly flagrant or large-scale violations of human rights. This is why Belgium insisted on having the Council hear Mr. van der Stoel on the human rights situation in Iraq. This is a delicate subject  as we are well aware. But international law is evolving  and since information has virtually lost its borders  frontiers are fading for injustice as well. Ultimately  States simply have to respect the international commitments they have undertaken as sovereign Powers. The unbreakable link between democracy and respect for human rights is also put in concrete terms in the United Nations system through the question of electoral assistance. Numerous requests for such assistance are currently being addressed to the Secretariat. In order to give an adequate response  precise standards must be established. The existing mechanisms which allow for some forms of electoral assistance must be fully used. This session of the General Assembly should enable us to clarify matters where necessary. The growing number of ethnic conflicts poses a special problem  half-way between the traditional questions of human rights and the exercise of the right to self-determination. Consequently  the protection of ethnic minorities deserves special attention at this time. In Europe  we continue to believe  in spite of recent disappointments  that the rules developed by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) remain valid. The right to self-determination must in no case be put forward to justify excesses and cruelties committed in its name. Besides  the protection of minorities should not necessarily or indeed exclusively be placed under the banner of self-determination. I wish to repeat what I said in the early part of my statement - for this seems to me to be a fundamental truth: excessive invocation of the principle of self-determination leads straight to a caricature of national sovereignty. It is necessary therefore to explore viable alternatives: real administrative decentralization  cultural autonomy  federal or confederate systems. The claims of minorities are above all the collective expression of a specific dignity and of human rights which cannot be trodden underfoot or ignored. Once this truth has been admitted  approaches more conciliatory than blind nationalism become possible. This is my hope for the future of the minorities issue. The current world situation has prompted me to concentrate my reflections around the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security  in the fight against underdevelopment and in the protection of human rights. In none of these fields can we hope to achieve lasting improvements without strengthened regional cooperation. As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter  in a world very different from the one its authors knew  the need for complementarity between the regional and global spheres has become obvious. We must work to define its modalities. At a time when Belgium is close to the end of its term of membership in the Security Council  I am pleased to note that this debate is taking place above all as regards the establishment and maintenance of peace."
"13",538,"BEN",47,1992,"Nigeria and Pakistan are mourning today. I should like to extend to the Governments and the peoples of these two friendly countries the compassion of the people of Benin who understand their sorrow and share their grief. I should like to join those who preceded me at this rostrum in congratulating Mr. Ganev warmly  on behalf of the Republic of Benin  on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. This is a well-deserved tribute to his country  Bulgaria  and to him personally. I should also like to congratulate his predecessor  Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  who presided over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly so ably and efficiently. I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for his courage  his dedication and his readiness in the service of the ideals of the Organization. Less than a year after his election  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already demonstrated his effectiveness and his diplomatic experience  to the admiration of the international community as a whole. His tireless efforts to restore peace to the various hotbeds of tension throughout the world deserve the active support of all the Members of the United Nations. His recent detailed and well-written report to the membership is eloquent testimony of his endeavours. My delegation would like once again to pay a tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his invaluable work at the service of our universal Organization  whose membership has continued to expand over the years. Benin welcomes the new Members of the United Nations: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. At the last session of the General Assembly  we unanimously welcomed the end of an era of confrontation and the advent of an era of international cooperation based on a spirit of solidarity and fraternity among the nations of the world. In that context  Benin also welcomed the advent and the admission to membership in the United Nations of the independent States that emerged from the former Soviet Union following the signing of the Minsk Agreements. The first ever meeting of the Security Council at the level of Heads of State or Government  held on 31 January 1992  marked the end of the cold war; at that meeting  they urged the advent of a new  more stable and more prosperous world order  for which the United Nations would provide the framework. Unfortunately  we have to say that this session of the Assembly is beginning at a time when there is an unprecedented reappearance of hotbeds of tension throughout the world  resulting in a situation in which peace-keeping activities have become the primary concern of the United Nations over the last 10 months. These hotbeds of tension demonstrate the fragility of peace and of international security  at an important turning-point in our history. May I point out here that the Security Council  in its statement of 31 January 1992  indicated that the development of the democratic movement and the promotion of respect for human rights would help make the world more stable and more prosperous. My delegation would like to reaffirm that the international community  while welcoming the emergence of new nations as a result of the affirmation of the unbreakable will of peoples to regain freedom  dignity and justice through respect for their own cultural and political values  must promote the search for consensus and the spirit of tolerance and dialogue which can still today provide the basis for a peaceful transition. Negotiation prevailing over the use of force  trade over exploitation  freedom over constraints: those are the approaches that should guide each of our countries so that the capacity of the Organization in the areas of preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping can be enhanced. We often say that our planet is sick. It is sick because of delayed development resulting from financial  technological  scientific and ecological imbalances between the northern and southern hemispheres. It is sick because of social injustice and because of extreme poverty that dehumanize so many peoples that are referred to as ""developing peoples"". To all these ills  aggravated today by the resurgence of nationalism  we must add new kinds of illnesses that are decimating our peoples throughout the world. It is therefore essential that States regain control and contribute individually and collectively to the strengthening of international peace and security. Against this backdrop  the Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  submitted pursuant to the statement agreed by the summit meeting of the Security Council on 31 January 1992  offers us food for thought serious thought and it opens up new prospects. We must all contribute to fleshing out that report so that our dream of a better world can become a reality in the years ahead. As for Africa  our continent has suffered too much for us not to try today  together  hand in hand  to join forces and use all that we have in the way of intelligence  courage  strength and resources  to lessen suffering  alleviate poverty and establish a coherent strategy for sustainable development. It is Benin's hope that all of Africa will be free of fratricidal and internal wars and all other conflicts that hinder our development. It is enough to look around us to see the tragedy of our brothers in Liberia  Somalia and Sudan  just to mention a few. From now on Africa can prove  if need be  that it can resolve its own conflicts when foreign interference does not complicate matters. To eliminate instability and insecurity in Africa  the international community must offer its firm support for the efforts now under way to restore peace to Liberia and Somalia. My country  which currently holds the chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  has been making intensive efforts since August to bring those involved in the Liberian tragedy to silence their weapons so that we can move towards national reconciliation. Benin's only interest in Liberia is peace. President Soglo's efforts deserve the support of Africans first and foremost and then of all the major Powers and all other Members of the United Nations. Benin hopes that recent appeals from the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  held from 28 June to 2 July 1992 in Dakar  to those involved in the tragedy in Somalia and Sudan will be heard so that hostilities can cease and negotiations can begin  with a view to national reconciliation. That  we believe  is a prerequisite for preserving the unity and integrity of those two countries  which are also ravaged by famine. It is important to emphasize the hope inspired by the humanitarian actions of the United Nations to save the people of Somalia from famine. Here I should also like to hail the work done by all the countries and humanitarian organizations that have taken action in that part of the world  despite the threats they are exposed to in the field by the various parties to the conflict. In particular  we hail the efforts of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to whom we are indebted for heightening awareness of that tragedy and its horrors. In addition  his Special Representative  Ambassador Sahnoun of Algeria  deserves our fraternal commendation and admiration. Just a few months ago  the international community welcomed the positive changes taking place in the situation in South Africa  changes that were expected to crown with success the tireless struggle of the black people of South Africa against a system that for more than 50 years had reduced them to slavery. Here I should like to reaffirm my country's unequivocal position on the problem of apartheid. That odious and inhuman system must be dismantled  in deeds and in law  to allow for the emergence of a democratic and multiracial South Africa  where the principle of one man  one vote  will become a political reality. Recent developments  both political and social in that country  notably the resumption of violence  which has already claimed hundreds of innocent victims  shows  unfortunately  that many difficulties and obstacles still have to be dealt with before apartheid can be totally dismantled. In the interest of international peace and security  we must encourage dialogue among those involved in the political situation in South Africa  who still have to overcome very deep political differences  while continuing at the same time to keep the pressure on the South African regime so that the reform processes that have been initiated can be continued and speeded up. That is how Benin understands the Security Council's adoption of resolution 765 (1992) on the question of South Africa  the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Special Representative and the sending of United Nations observers to that country. We are happy to see that the peace process in Angola  which began with the signing of the cease-fire agreement at Estoril  Portugal  on 31 May 1991  is on course. The Members of the United Nations must continue to support that country  which has been riven by 15 years of fratricidal war  in its efforts for democratization  one important stage of which will be the free elections scheduled for 29 and 30 September 1992  that is  tomorrow and the day after. The delegation of Benin welcomes the fact that the peace talks which have begun between the Maputo Government and RENAMO leaders have led to the signing at Rome on 7 August 1992 of a peace agreement between the two parties. May peace truly and definitively come to Mozambique so that all the sons and daughters of that country can tackle the job of national reconstruction. The Madrid Conference on peace in the Middle East portended a reasonable arrangement between Arabs and Israelis with a hope for lasting peace. Recent political changes in Israel may enable the current negotiations to evolve in a satisfactory manner that would be acceptable to all parties to the conflict. !t is our duty to encourage that needed dialogue  with a view to achieving a lasting peace that would guarantee the existence of the Hebrew State and a Palestinian State within secure borders recognized by all. That  of course  would presuppose our listening to both parties. It is in that spirit that Benin this year resumed diplomatic relations with the State of Israel. We are guided by our firm resolve to use our pivotal position as a traditional friend of the Arab States and a new partner of the State of Israel as a point of departure to help bring the two parties together as best we can. My country wholeheartedly hopes for success at the peace process that began in Madrid. A solution to the Middle East Problem also involves the consistent and effective implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  emphasizing the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory through war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace  enabling each State in the region to live in safety within boundaries that are internationally recognized and guaranteed by the international community  including Palestine and Israel. My country is distressed at the killing and the flagrant violations of human rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina stemming from the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The continuing tragedy of the peoples of that country threatens international peace and security and constitutes a new challenge to our Organization. In my Government's opinion  there are three factors that could have a favourable influence on efforts undertaken by the European States and the United Nations to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia. These are an immediate cessation of hostilities; respect for the territorial integrity of the various States that have emerged from the disintegration of the former Federation; and the protection of minorities. I would add to this our unequivocal condemnation of the intolerable practice of ""ethnic cleansing""  a practice unworthy of humankind and one of which each and every human being should be ashamed today. Given the universality of our Organization  however  my country hopes that the request for admission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro will encounter no obstacles and that the admission of that country might even be a catalyst for a just and lasting peace in the Balkans. The new spirit of consensus particularly among the permanent members of the Security Council and the end of the cold war have encouraged the present atmosphere of detente in the international political arena. In that context  general and complete disarmament must remain the international community's ultimate goal at the end of the twentieth century. The Republic of Benin would like to see the enormous resources devoted to the manufacture and purchase of weaponry shifted towards satisfying the more urgent need for development of the third world countries. We believe that a major step in that direction would be the acceptance by the international community particularly the arms-producing countries of the Secretary-General's proposal on taxing arms sales in order to offset the budgetary deficit of the United Nations and provide it with the resources it needs to carry out the work entrusted to it. My country therefore supports this proposal by Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Moreover  Benin supports all United Nations resolutions related to the reduction  limitation  and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is often being said that the international community is today at a turning-point. The will expressed by Member States to move towards the solution of regional conflicts and the new feeling of urgency in the face of global threats to the well-being of the planet give us an historic opportunity to tackle the real problems we all face. Of course  the world economy has developed in a rather remarkable way in the past few years  as demonstrated  inter alia  by the extension of the market economy and the emergence of major economic groupings in Western Europe and North America. However  the international cooperation necessary to the creation of a new world order is not really getting under way. The imbalances between North and South are being exacerbated. If the current trends persist until the year 2000  the citizens of the richest nations of the world will have an average annual income of more than $13 600 while those from the least developed African countries will have an average per capita income of only $217 that is  $12 less than in 1985. This sharp decrease has already been seen in many countries. We must therefore acknowledge that the problem of the economic liberation of Africa is one that still faces us most acutely. All the efforts made to wipe out and reverse this trend towards deterioration in the economies of our countries have been in vain. Africa's economic horizon is darkening daily-Here  I should like to broach the question of debt  and more specifically in sub-Saharan African. In one report on the debt crisis  the Secretary-General stressed that the heavy obligations imposed by debt servicing have given rise to serious budgetary problems. Public investment and social expenditures have suffered the results of this  and the most vulnerable social sectors have therefore been the most seriously affected. Today  our continent groans under the crushing burden of debt  which now amounts to more than $270 billion. In 1990  our States had to pay out $23 billion to service this debt. Confronted by these increasingly harsh resource problems  most of our States have committed themselves to structural adjustment programmes. These programmes do not yet have the resources that are truly necessary to the development of our devastated economies. That is why Benin appeals to the international community to take concrete  urgent action to reduce the debt burden of the African countries and increase financial flows for their development. Measures to ease or cancel debt in some cases debt that our countries find so difficult to bear should be accompanied by detailed and explicit programmes on the conditions for financing structural adjustment programmes and repaying the debt owed by our States. On another level  the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  following consideration and final evaluation of the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 adopted the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. That was an opportunity to refocus the international community's interest in the socio-economic difficulties facing the countries of Africa. To reach the objectives of the New Agenda  it is now time for the international community to translate into real action the commitments that have been entered into and renewed so many times to support the efforts made by the African countries themselves to achieve autonomous growth and socio-economic development. Indeed  the Secretary-General has said that Africa is one of the five United Nations priorities for the 1990s. As to the other four priorities the environment  peace-keeping  the fight against drug abuse  and humanitarian assistance we have to say that no actual decision has been taken to translate this priority into action. My delegation feels serious concern about the situation that still prevails one year after the adoption of resolution 46/151 on the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. First  the Secretary-General's programme has not yet really been launched. Secondly  the follow-up mechanisms  for example  the high-level consultative group  the inter-agency committee and the steering committee  have not yet been set up. Thirdly  the study on the need for and the feasibility of establishing a diversification fund for African commodities has not yet been carried out  even though it is supposed to be the subject of a report by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session. Lastly  the setting up of adequate financial resources is still hypothetical. I would like to express the ardent hope that no effort will be spared to ensure that by December 1992  or at the latest by January 1993  the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s will emerge from its present lethargy and enter a truly active and dynamic phase that will live up to our hopes. To a certain extent  the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s is experiencing the same difficulties as the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. This will hardly help to improve the living and working conditions of the most vulnerable groups in the least developed countries. It is essential to continue and support efforts aimed at ensuring that the number of least developed countries  particularly in Africa  can be cut in half by the end of the twentieth century. We must thus reverse the tendency towards increasing the number of least developed countries  a trend that has been noted since the adoption of the Programme of Action in September 1990 and the adoption of the new criteria for classification in 1991. My Government feels that the International Conference on Financing Development could provide responses to the difficulties facing the various programmes and plans of action for the development of the countries of the South. For that reason  we sincerely hope that the General Assembly will  during this session  adopt a resolution to convene the Conference  which will be prepared as part of the process of intergovernmental negotiations with the participation of all States. The holding of such a Conference will be an important element in the process of strengthening the role of the United Nations in promoting international economic cooperation. We welcome the Japanese initiative to organize in 1993 an international conference on the development of Africa. The work of that conference should be a good preparatory exercise for the Conference on Financing Development. Benin believes that economic integration is also a response to the marginalization of Africa. It is essential today for our States that the regional economic groupings we have created in order to ensure South-South cooperation should be strengthened. Africa  determined to continue with vigour the policy it has been following in this sphere for effective regional and subregional economic cooperation and integration  is thus particularly committed to the creation of the African Economic Community  whose Constitution was signed by the Heads of State and Government on 3 June 1991 at Abuja. Success for this project presupposes  I believe  a commitment by each of our States to promote integration in the various activity sectors of our economies and to ensure the development and maintenance of reliable networks of agricultural  road and industrial infrastructures on the continent. Despite the economic situation of our countries  many specific actions have been taken to help children as part of the follow-up of the World Summit for Children. On 16 June 1992 Benin celebrated the Day of the African Child  as we had in 1991. Although my country had already scored some successes  the celebrations on that day enabled us to place even more emphasis on improving the health of mothers and children through the expanded vaccination programme  the struggle to combat malnutrition and other widespread diseases of children  the provision of drinking water to rural areas  the gradual reduction of illiteracy and the securing of access to education for all children. Africa aspires to development of the whole person  and to that end  we must be sure to involve women and children. They are  after all  the majority of the people of our countries on the path of progress  which can be achieved primarily through the education and training of young people and adults. Benin welcomes the action already taken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  together with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  with a view to the holding of the International Conference on Assistance for the African Child  to be held at Dakar from 25 to 27 November 1992. Parallel with its actions in behalf of children  my Government is also preparing actively to mark the International Year of the Family in 1994. In addition  we stand ready to make a worthwhile contribution to the preparatory work for the World Conference on Women  to be held at Beijing in 1995. A few years ago each of our States  particularly the richer ones among us  was content to act alone at the national level in order to stop environmental degradation. Today we have to recognize that the major ecological problems we face are planetary in dimension and require an international approach. In that context  Benin welcomes the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)  held from 3 to 14 June 1992 at Rio de Janeiro. While that historic conference  in which my country took an active part  did not fully live up to the hopes placed in it  it did enshrine the concept of sustainable development and a recognition of the undeniable link that exists between environmental protection and economic development. Benin  convinced that dealing with environmental and development problems requires the coordination of activities  initiatives and programmes  welcomes the agreement reached at Rio on institutional mechanisms for following up UNCED decisions  particularly the establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development. In our opinion  that commission will play an essential role in the implementation and follow-up of Agenda 21  adopted at Rio by the Conference. With a strong and competent secretariat  which could be headquartered at Geneva  the commission on sustainable development should make it possible  we believe  to coordinate  facilitate and orient intergovernmental action within the United Nations system in the area of environment. The members of the commission  to be elected by the General Assembly  should represent all the regional groups in the United Nations and all types of development. As well as supporting the establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development  which will be the subject of a draft resolution at this session  Benin stresses the great importance we attach to following up all the decisions and recommendations of the Rio Conference. We welcome in advance the resolutions the Assembly will adopt in this connection  including that by which the Assembly will establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee to draft by June 1994 an international convention to combat desertification  particularly in Africa. We also look forward to a resolution on the financing of Agenda 21  whose implementation by developing countries will require new  additional funds. The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development does not reflect all the concerns expressed during the preparatory process for the Conference; the General Assembly must therefore adopt a resolution with a view to preparing an Earth charter to be adopted during the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations in 1995  as proposed by the Secretary-General of the Conference  Mr. Maurice Strong. While cruel at times  our age can now be proud of having witnessed the emergence of a universal human-rights movement. An awareness of democracy is spreading throughout the world  a world where men and women used to be reduced to silence and wretchedness. Democracy is slowly becoming a reality that it will be difficult to ignore. The credo of Benin  henceforth to be a State where the rule of law is paramount  is respect for  and the promotion and defence of  human rights and the rights of peoples. That is why we support the 1993 convening of a World Conference on Human Rights and are already participating actively in the Preparations for that high-level Conference. It is necessary to promote social development if we are to promote  protect and defend human rights. To the hungry  human rights can mean little if nothing is done to improve health care and education  to eliminate hunger and wretchedness  and to improve housing and the quality of life in short  to achieve greater well-being. That is why my country welcomes the decision to convene a world summit for social development in 1995; this will enshrine the human dimension of development. I wish on behalf of the Government and the people of Benin to pay tribute to all nations  large and small  that have shown unswerving support and friendship for my country  particularly in the past two years  and that have supported and encouraged democratic renewal in Benin: the political  economic and moral rebirth of my country. I pay a special tribute to friendly agencies  bodies and Governments for their continued cooperation as we ponder  evaluate  organize and take decisions on all aspects of the lasting economic and social recovery of Benin  and for all they did to prepare for  coordinate  organize and hold the round-table meeting of partners in the economic and social development of the Republic of Benin  which took place at Geneva on 2 and 3 April 1992. It is my great hope that the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly will achieve a consensus acceptable to all in the negotiations on the restructuring of the United Nations system and the strengthening of the Organization's role in promoting international economic cooperation and consolidating our achievements in peace-keeping and international security. I also hope that it will show our peoples that it is still working for solidarity  partnership for development and hope. "
"14",584,"BFA",47,1992,"At the outset  I should like to convey the sincere congratulations of the delegation of Burkina Faso to Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. In him  we pay a tribute to Bulgaria and to the qualities that earned him these responsibilities. We also pay a tribute to the devotion and conscientiousness with which his predecessor  Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  performed his duties. Nine months after our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  assumed his post  his energy  creative imagination and firm determination have left their mark on the activities of our Organization. By strengthening its universality  all the countries that have been admitted since the forty-sixth session give us grounds for joy. We wish them all a warm welcome and we have no doubt that we will all work together to attain the ideals of the United Nations Charter. Our times have seen the irrepressible aspirations of peoples to freedom  national identity  and well-being flourish with more vigour and insistence than ever before. For some  these aspirations arose from the depths of their alienation  which they now reject; for others  from the example thus set by the former. Baptized as a ""wave of democratization""  this tempest  sometimes coinciding with developments already under way  swept away many inappropriate or obsolete human edifices to lay bare the ruins or foundations from which we must start building. Born in 1987  the democratization movement in Burkina Faso  after years of an emergency regime  led to pluralism  to the election of a Head of State on 1 December 1987  and to general elections held in May 1992  in which the political parties asked the people for their votes. Today  democratic institutions are in place and the opposition  which sits in the Assembly  is also represented in the executive branch  where it holds several ministerial portfolios. This transition has been without jolts or major crises  and has led to the social peace necessary to our development efforts. This indispensable social peace is what is lacking in Somalia  where our famished brothers are dying at a mind-boggling rate  whereas weapons are ubiquitous there and have made that martyred country a victim bled dry by intransigence and the absence of dialogue. In this respect  we welcome the healthy reaction of our Secretary-General  who is trying to size up the true scale of this tragedy and to find the requisite solutions. We are equally grateful for the international humanitarian assistance channelled there. But much remains to be done to curtail and end the sufferings of the Somalian people. Liberia is still in the throes of a civil war to which Burkina Faso and the other countries of the region cannot remain indifferent. Burkina Faso  shoulder to shoulder with them  will spare no effort to restore lasting peace so that the policy of economic integration  begun within the framework of the Economic Community of West African States  can also be pursued as well as possible. In Angola  general elections are under way after 16 years of conflict suffered by the Angolan people. We hail the maturity of all Angolans  who have thereby agreed to close a difficult chapter in their history. The United Nations also played a positive role there. We hope that these developments will be successful. In Mozambique  similarly  a solution is in the offing  and we hope that a negotiated settlement will restore peace. In South Africa  the hopes of the international community have been dimmed by the massacres of Boipatong and Ciskei. These events certainly were a manifestation of apartheid  whose death throes are just as repugnant and bloody as was its existence. We need to remind the South African authorities that they are responsible for the security of every South African and that these tragic excesses cannot simply be ascribed to animosity among blacks. It is now well established that subtle manipulation  together with an absence of security controls  can fan the flames of an already explosive situation. The resumption of the Convention for Democratic South Africa (CODESA) should take place in a climate free of the suspicion born of manoeuvring and calculation. In this respect  we believe that Security Council 765 (1992) of 16 July 1992 is only one step in the right direction. In order to assess the methods and effects of violence  more than 50 observers will be needed. In the Middle East  the process begun at the Madrid Conference has yet to produce the hoped-for results. The Palestinian question remains and the aspirations of the Palestinian people are legitimate and justified. The political changes that have taken place in Israel raise hopes that we would wish to see fulfilled on behalf of the people of the region. In Cambodia  efforts must continue to be made by all to implement the Paris Agreements. The unprecedented commitment of the United Nations should be welcomed  encouraged and reinforced. In the heart of Europe  a conflict is developing  the nature of which is what observers tend to limit exclusively to Africa. Practices we thought had disappeared with nazism and condemned alongside apartheid are emerging under the label ""ethnic cleansing"". This is unacceptable. We cannot accept that Bosnia and Herzegovina be crucified in the name of religion or ethnicity. The London agreement and the Geneva negotiations must be complied with and pursued by all parties sincerely desirous of peace and reconciliation. That picture does not inspire optimism. The collapse of one of the two blocs did not solve the world's problems. Rather  it emphasized the North-South split; old wounds that are still open; internal contradictions within regions; and divisions among nations. In their millions  people are cast out into a life of wandering; children are robbed of their childhood  and of their adolescence too; a future without hope is already the lot of a growing number of people caught in the crossfire between one world that is dying and another that is being born. In the midst of all the uncertainty  the United Nations seemed to be a place of recourse where East  West  North and South could meet to accept the principles of the Charter and institute methods guaranteeing that armed force would not be used save in the common interest  and to promote social progress and better standards of life in wider freedom. Security  solidarity  progress and freedom: these are words and concepts that 47 years after San Francisco have yet to be given form in the interest of the world's peoples. The Secretary-General's proposals in his Agenda for Peace and in his annual report on the work of the Organization form a good basis for discussion. It must be recalled and stressed that security not based on the interests of all  large and small  is self-limited. The maintenance of peace demands weighty and onerous operations that must be commensurate with the needs. It is right to stress preventive diplomacy: machinery for early warning and action that can be put into play before a conflict breaks out or that can prevent a conflict from taking place. The United Nations  while in demand on all sides  remains available. It is regrettable that among the defenders of this new role for the Organization are those who by not paying their contributions are handicapping the United Nations in this basic task. We must ensure that the role of the Security Council does not give rise to questions about its involvement  its impartiality or its sense of fairness. The system devised 47 years ago has only been able to function for two years  and already there are concerns  some of which are justified. Depending on their geographical zone  conflicts seem to attract varying degrees of vigorous attention from the Council. This makes us believe that a structure created following the Second World War is now beginning to function in a completely different context. Some even talk of an anachronism. Clearly  the role and composition of the Security Council must be reviewed. But we fear that the discussion might be limited to merely expanding a club whose members would continue to view their status as a privilege  not a weighty responsibility. The spirit and perhaps even the nature of the Council must be changed. Clearly  we must begin the debate on the Security Council  even if we are still bound by the terms of Article 108 of the Charter. The democratization of international relations is necessary. There can be no true security or just and lasting peace while three quarters of mankind continues to live in destitution  wretchedness and ignorance. That is a fact that has been repeated in this Hall over the years by a majority of delegations. Today's world is a world in flux  where the old questions remain and new solutions are taking too long in coming. The North-South rift I mentioned before can be illustrated by figures  including the well-known fact that 20 per cent of the world's population receives 83 per cent of the world's income  while the poorest 20 per cent share but 1.4 per cent of the world's income. Beset by natural disasters  conflicts and the effects of an international economic crisis  Africa still bears an external debt of more than $236.7 billion; it faces tariff and customs barriers erected by some of its economic partners; and it must deal with a high rate of population growth. To this we must add the obligatory adoption of structural adjustment programmes that will first cause pain before possibly doing some good. ""Possibly"" is the right word  since these adjustments are put in place in a context of economic uncertainty that jeopardizes the results for which we hope. Thus  we in Burkina Faso are working to obtain all the necessary support so that slippages will not call into question our political achievements  and particularly so that the structural-adjustment programme can lay the lasting foundations of genuine development and growth. The rewards of the tireless efforts by African countries have not been commensurate with the sacrifices we have made. The promises of the North remain promises  just as the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has not been truly implemented  except by Africans themselves. A new page has been turned with the new programme for the 1990s  but that page remains blank. We hail the few industrialized countries that have honoured their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product as official development assistance. The international economic context is marked by increased monetary instability  slower economic growth  high unemployment and the relative failure of the Uruguay Round. But capital needs are first met among the industrialized countries before they turn to so-called transitional economies. Can we speak of competition for capital? Or must we say that Africa is simply waiting for a response that has not been forthcoming? The response we want to hear and to turn into reality is the economic integration of our continent South-South cooperation along with allowing us the latitude of choice. As we said at the forty-sixth session  Burkina Faso is convinced that all our problems ""can be solved only by dialogue and negotiation between developed and developing countries with a view to bringing about specific solutions through a multilateral approach to these problems"". (A/46/PV.4. p. 56) That was our approach to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development the Earth Summit at Rio  and that was why we welcomed the framework Convention on climate change and the Convention on biodiversity. The establishment of a commission for sustainable development could define the framework for what we have come to call the new global partnership. But as we all know  the Rio summit will be meaningful only if it is followed by the needed commitments with respect to additional resources and technology transfers. The Earth Summit has made the link between environment and development indissoluble. We welcome the decision of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to set up an intergovernmental negotiating committee to draw up an international convention in the struggle against desertification. Burkina Faso will participate actively in that process and could act as host to some of the committee's meetings. International events on the horizon include: the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993; the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994; the world summit for social development in 1995; and the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  also in 1995. What they have in common is their subject and their protagonist: man. We have already said that no one is against human rights because those rights are inherent in man. A partial  piecemeal vision of human rights would doom mankind to exploitation and abandonment. The right to development  to food  to housing  to primary health care and to education: all these are part of human rights. To support that aspect without recognizing and accepting the basic nature of the rights of the individual would clearly be an imperfect approach to defining and solving the problem. Likewise  stressing the rights of the individual while confining oneself to defending them would be to refuse to see the world as it is today. Indeed  earlier I spoke of the indomitable nature of the peoples' aspirations to freedom  national identity and well-being. The revolution in communication  the spread of ideas  the untapped potential of techniques and technologies have turned our world into a global village. We cannot indefinitely guarantee the security of the haves  the well-fed  to the detriment of others without doing permanent damage to the dignity and integrity of others. That is why Burkina Faso believes that population questions are fundamental  and that is why we spoke out in favour of the convening of the world summit for social development. Nor can we approach the question of human rights and questions of population and development without including women  the mothers of the world. These future conferences will be fairly meaningless if they do not lead to commitments that will lead  in turn  to tangible  concrete and satisfactory results. In that connection the follow-up to the World Summit for Children is important  and I should like to take this opportunity to remind the international community that in November at Dakar  Senegal  an African regional meeting will be held  under the aegis of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  to examine and evaluate responses to the commitments undertaken at New York in 1990 and to assess the support that could be supplied by all the members of the international community. Those meetings are therefore based on the principle of our common membership in the human race and on solidarity. In 1995 the Organization will be 50 years old. The evolution in international relations has created an ever-greater role for the United Nations. We can even talk about a central role for it  as a crucial junction where political  economic  social and environmental concerns can be expressed and actually dealt with. Hitherto regarded as a forum  the United Nations can now add to cooperation  deliberation and the ongoing discussion of the trio of peace  security and development its status as an unparalleled instrument at the service of joint action for the common good. Burkina Faso will follow and actively discuss the various reforms and restructuring being planned for the whole of the United Nations system  for it is our conviction that they afford the international community a unique opportunity to implement the concept of global partnership. It is only under those conditions that we will at last be able truly to implement the noble ideals of the Charter. It will no longer be a question of some pitted against others but  rather  of fighting the only fight worth fighting: the fight for a humanity living at peace in a saved environment. "
"15",627,"BGD",47,1992,"The General Assembly stands poised at a vital watershed. It is a time of opportunity and challenge  of promise and uncertainty  of hopes and unfulfilled expectations. In many ways we are entering new and uncharted territory. We must beat out our own track with caution  deliberation and conviction. We must  above all  invoke and nurture that spirit of commonality  commitment  innovation and imagination that is so uniquely manifest today  as we confront together the unprecedented transition in world affairs. We are all conscious of the significance of this moment in history. We are in the last decade of a tumultuous century and millennium. We are straddling the threshold of a new century a new era carrying with us the aspirations of our people for a better  more prosperous  peaceful and fulfilling life. Three years from now the United Nations will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. Our efforts in the interim will surely determine its course for future generations. There is no doubt that the United Nations is but a reflection of the wishes of its component parts. It is in a real sense the collective instrument for promoting the interests of all States  weak or strong  rich or poor  large or small. At the heart of its success or failure is the contribution to its purposes and principles that each individual country must make. It is the sum total of these individual efforts that is the real foundation of the success of the United Nations in maintaining peace  securing justice and human rights  and promoting the key Charter prerogative of ""social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". I reaffirm today the total commitment of Bangladesh to furthering the objectives of the United Nations Charter and the cause of multilateralism. Indeed  this is a constitutional commitment. In doing so  I would like to underscore the dominant theme of my statement: How can a relatively small State contribute towards making this Organization a viable instrument  capable of dealing effectively and comprehensively with all aspects of human development  be they political  economic  social or environmental? Mr. President  before I proceed further  let me join my voice to the well-deserved tributes paid to you. Sir  on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your knowledge and experience will  I am sure  guide us well in these challenging times. I am confident that you will do great honour to the legacy left by your illustrious predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  of Saudi Arabia  to whom we are all deeply indebted. We extend our warm tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has taken charge and is steering the course of our Organization at perhaps its most daunting period of renewal  revival and resurgence. We pledge to him our unstinted support and cooperation in the furtherance of his endeavours.* I would also like to welcome in our midst the many new countries that have taken their seat in the General Assembly this year  swelling our ranks to 179 Member States. Most of them represent peoples who have recently gained freedom. Their"" presence strengthens not only our common goal for universality but adds a new forceful voice that gives meaning to the expression of the very first words of the Charter of the United Nations: ""We the peoples of the United Nations"". We look forward to working with them in close and friendly cooperation. Previous speakers have discussed at length the nature of the contemporary world setting  the massive pressures that have radically changed relationships between States and individuals  and the resulting positive and negative trends that have emerged. It is not my intention to repeat this analysis. Suffice it to say that one paramount task emerges: how to tilt the balance of contradictory forces in favour of the evolution of a new  more beneficial  more just and peaceful world order. At the heart of the issue is the creation of an environment of peace. Ironically  the sources of conflict are rooted in the absence of progress in objectives we most seek to promote the enhancement of human rights and fundamental freedoms  the promotion of sustainable economic and social development for wider prosperity  the alleviation of human distress  and the curtailment of the existence and use of weapons of mass destruction. Of real concern to third world countries are certain negative impulses. A prime factor is continuing anxiety that their interests are being marginalized both politically and economically. Insularity and internal domestic preoccupations of the major Powers open up prospects of a power vacuum and of the consequent danger of regional competition and hegemony. Diversion of resources along an East-West axis can leave the South starved of political resources and investment. These fears are multiplied by the emergence of new constraints that circumscribe development cooperation standards of good governance  rigid structural adjustment measures  environmental criteria and scrutiny of military intentions and preparedness. What is basically at issue is a degree of perception. It is not opposition to these recognizably needed changes  but resistance to any form of dictation with regard to how they should be achieved. A flexible attitude is perhaps the best prescription. Too often the role of people has been ignored to the peril of the world community. One extreme manifestation is that national self-assertion has resurfaced. It has brought realization to the right of self-determination  but it has also released long-suppressed ethnic  cultural  linguistic and cultural rivalries and has unleashed bigotry  extremism and violence. This is at a time when  after years of patient pressure  racism and racial discrimination were being isolated and apartheid dismantled. They have generated powerful centrifugal forces that threaten established boundaries. At the same time  poverty  disease  famine and repression have joined together to produce a massive movement of people within and beyond national borders 17 million refugees and 20 million displaced persons worldwide all of which have combined to create a new dimension of insecurity that must be addressed in all its ramifications. The pre-eminent task before us is to forge a new  more focused and action-oriented world agenda to promote peace  tolerance  justice and development. It is of crucial import that this should be time-targeted  prioritized  fully-funded and cost-efficient. The structure and shape of this agenda has already assumed significant substance. The first-ever summit of the Security Council members took place in January 1992. The outcome of that meeting concentrated on an agenda for peace encompassing preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and what the Secretary-General characterized as post-conflict peace-building. Other substantial inputs have been made or are envisaged including  inter alia: the 1990 World Summit for children; the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on narcotic drugs; the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Conference on Environment and Development; the 1993 summit on human rights; the 1994 conference on population and development; the 1995 world conference on women and a world summit for social development. These accompany far-reaching proposals that are under way to reform  strengthen and streamline the Organization to enable it to fulfil its responsibility as the central organ for the cooperative management of the world's problems. If the world Organization is to succeed and flourish  it will depend as much on the resilience of its Member States to prosper individually as on their ability constructively to contribute to its great goals and purposes. Positive efforts by each country cumulatively strengthen the sum total of the United Nations mandate. What then is Bangladesh's contribution to this grand design? The quest for a new world order must begin with putting our own house in order. In our region  Bangladesh has sought actively to maintain the momentum and credibility of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) and by promoting its essentially socio-economic mandate to create a broad-based climate of confidence-building  to reduce tension in the region and to resolve outstanding bilateral differences by dialogue and negotiation. It is on us  as Chairman of the forthcoming seventh summit of SAARC  that the onus of responsibility has fallen to promote these aims in more productive and tangible ways  especially as SAARC stands poised to enter its second cycle of annual summit meetings. Bilaterally  the democratically elected Government of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia  has initiated concerted steps to bolster a new chapter of positive interaction with our immediate neighbours  following years of inactivity. The upsurge of democracy throughout the region has significantly contributed to this objective. In recent months official visits by the Prime Minister to Sri Lanka  India and Pakistan have been motivated by one major determinant to eschew past inhibitions and look to the future. Some issues remain complex and sensitive but approaches to solutions are being forged through continuing and pragmatic dialogue. The exodus of Myanmar refugees to Bangladesh since November 1991 imposed a heavy additional burden on the new government  coming as it did in the wake of the devastating cyclone of May 1991 and the cumulative adverse impact of the aftermath of the Gulf War. The option of confrontation loomed large. Yet through circumspection  restraint and a conscious defusion of tension  the groundwork was laid for an eventual solution by mutual agreement in April 1992. Despite this agreement  some 270 000 Myanmar refugees still remain in our territory as efforts continue to repatriate them in honour  safety and dignity and above all on a voluntary basis. Given the dire compulsions under which the refugees fled  the process of persuading them to return is a difficult and drawn-out one. Time targets are at best approximate and increase the liabilities of the Government in terms of costs  environmental damage and tension with and among the local population. The critical catalyst for guaranteeing safe repatriation and resettlement remains an impartial United Nations presence. Efforts continue to overcome Myanmar's reticence on this score. Yet  bilaterally the two countries are cooperating positively. I am happy to announce that the first minimal step has been taken with the voluntary repatriation of some 49 refugees on 23 September 1992. It is hoped this will constitute a crack in the wall towards the voluntary return of the remaining refugees. Globally  Bangladesh supports all measures to strengthen the United Nation's capacity to prevent war and resolve conflicts and to extend this capacity in new and imaginative ways. It is of key importance to preserve the security of small States and to promote the concept of preventive diplomacy  especially to anticipate and contain damage in times of man-made or natural disasters. It is a matter of some satisfaction that the role of the United Nations in helping to resolve the Myanmar refugee problem was the first objective test of preventive diplomacy in action. The visit of Mr. Jan Eliasson  the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs  to Bangladesh and Myanmar respectively  was to trigger the agreement between the two countries for repatriation of the refugees. We believe that there is a real chance today that collective security can be achieved through promotion of the unrealized premises of the United Nations Charter  including the fostering of regional security arrangements under Chapter VIII. Regional groupings can and must concentrate on harnessing durable structures of stability  starting at the base and working through confidence-building measures and broad-based socio-economic cooperation. Reduced reliance on military security must be buttressed through monitoring  regulating and limiting the growing traffic in arms. At the national level  doctrines of minimum defence self-sufficiency equated with the innovative use of armed forces as human development investment could lead to a realistic release of a peace dividend. One recent measure of note in Bangladesh is that budget allocations for defence this year are less than those for education. At the same time  we have purposefully contributed to United Nations peace-keeping efforts through the despatch of military and civilian contingents to monitor the elections in Namibia  to police cease-fire lines in the Gulf  to help clear mines and support the restructuring effort in Kuwait  and to assist the United Nations peace processes in Cambodia  Yugoslavia and Western Sahara. We strongly support the strengthening of the financial and institutional base of peace-keeping and its growth in new and imaginative directions. We have striven  through specific initiatives  to participate constructively and with moderation and pragmatism in all socio-economic forums  especially to project the concerns of the least developed countries and to keep alive the commitment to preferential treatment of the poorest of the poor. The critical socio-economic situation in Africa deserves special attention. In Bangladesh we have learnt one fundamental lesson: there is no shortcut to progress  no matter how reliable or generous our friends may be. Whether it relates to achieving freedom from political oppression  vindicating human rights or seeking social and economic emancipation  a country must ultimately depend on itself. Three consequent goals have emerged: first and foremost  to bolster individual self-reliance and move away from aid-centricity to more defined development cooperation; secondly  to intensify South-South cooperation and collective self reliance in such specific and practical areas as food production  manpower planning  trade  investments and joint ventures and modalities to implement them; and finally  to reactivate constructive North-South dialogue and the creation of an external environment conducive to the revitalizing of growth and the targeting  in particular  of the reduction and elimination of poverty. There has been a growing convergence of strategies to redress the critical issues of falling investment  reduction and restructuring of debt  trade promotion and the transfer of technology. Successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round remains a pressing priority. These goals must be pursued to a logical and urgent conclusion. Another crucial element must be stressed: the development objective must be put in sharper focus than the theme of adjustment that has long overshadowed it; structural adjustment measures are necessary  but must avoid undue hardships which often lead the poorest sections of the population to bear a disproportionate part of the burden. At home  a crucial policy imperative has been the drawing up of a vision and strategy for the future that would align participatory democracy with the country's development needs. This new development perspective focuses on human development  participatory planning  and greater induction and involvement of women in development and the alleviation of poverty. It recognizes the need to raise investment so as to achieve growth in excess of 5 per cent per annum  and identifies efficiency improvement as one of the important means of attaining this end. It aims at achieving a symbiosis between agriculture and industry that will address the needs of growth  employment generation and poverty alleviation. To ensure that this link is sustained and can lead to a take-off for the economy  investment in the social sectors is given central importance. The factors I have mentioned highlight one basic reality: the fabric of self-reliance is intimately woven out of three strands democracy  development and human rights. Our own experience has underlined certain basic truths. Without democracy  a people's potential for socio-economic progress cannot flower. Equally  without improved standards of living and a vision for the future that can sustain hope  democracy will wither. Human rights become meaningless in the face of the dire constraints of poverty  hunger  disease and illiteracy. No other right can take precedence over the amelioration of this condition. Bangladesh fully reaffirms that basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are of universal validity. We believe that a human rights culture embracing all freedoms must evolve in a uniform way. Perhaps the most vital aspect of this that has yet to find universal acceptance is recognition of the right to development. Surely  peace and stability cannot be achieved unless conditions are created to remove the root causes of war and conflict  that is  economic and social deprivation. We look forward to participating in the second World Conference on Human Rights  in June 1993  and to ensuring that the Conference addresses all aspects of human rights on the basis of universality  indivisibility and impartiality. Since the only real protection of small and weaker States is firmly rooted in the rule of law  Bangladesh has constantly striven to promote its progressive development and codification internationally and regionally  and to promote its due reflection at home through enabling legislation. We shall remain active in pursuing these endeavours  especially in promoting such priority areas as the non-navigational uses of international water-courses  the international law of the sea  environmental protection and the status of refugees  economic migrants and displaced persons. No one can doubt the serious potential for conflict that the absence of law holds in these areas. They remain a pressing priority for concentrated movement forward. Through national legislation  its regional extension and international participation  we have also contributed to addressing solutions to global problems of drugs  terrorism and protection of the environment. We welcome in particular the outcome of the Rio Conference  which has addressed the issues of environment and development  which are inextricably linked. Sustainable development calls for a new global partnership  including the provision of new and additional financial resources to developing countries and adequate access for them to environmentally sound technology. Social aspects must also remain at the heart of our endeavours  especially concentration on disadvantaged groups that the pursuit of economic growth tends to bypass. We therefore wholeheartedly support the convening of the World Summit for Social Development. Bangladesh supports the view that the full integration of women in the development process at all levels is of critical importance. We stand committed to promoting the success of the World Conference on Women to be held in 1995. Equally  the rights and status of children remain a paramount priority. This year the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation  along with the United Nations Children's Fund  is focusing particular attention on the rights of children in South Asia  in keeping with the commitment of the countries of the region to the full implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children. No statement is complete if we do not address ourselves to some of the outstanding conflict and tension points around the globe. Since the creation of the United Nations  over 100 major conflicts have taken a toll of some 20 million dead. The cold war imposed its own peculiar threat to security. With its demise  vital new possibilities have opened up for forging a new security regime. The United Nations has emerged as a central instrument for the prevention and resolution of conflicts. Bangladesh is determined to contribute in whatever ways it can  directly or indirectly  to making it more effective and responsive in new and creative ways. I turn now to the critical political issues on our agenda. Bangladesh's consistent and categorical position on the Middle East question and the issue of Palestine needs no reiteration. We believe the Palestinians' cause to be founded on justice. We welcome the convening of the peace conference and the start of substantive parallel negotiations over the framework of a peaceful settlement. We believe that this should be comprehensive  should include Palestine  and must be based on a serious commitment by Israel to abide by Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  and the principle of returning land for peace. It is our hope that Israel will show sincerity of purpose and greater flexibility and will refrain from delaying the peace process. It is our fervent hope that all parties in Afghanistan will respect the cease-fire and faithfully implement the Peshawar Accord of April 1992  which reflected a broad consensus of all Afghan leaders. This would lay the groundwork for holding free and fair elections so that a permanent government could emerge reflecting the wishes and aspirations of the Afghan people. At the same time  it would ensure much needed political  economic and social stability. There is vital need for the world community to contribute  generously and actively towards the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan and towards the safe and voluntary return of refugees to their homeland. The implementation of the 1991 Paris Agreement on a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia has progressed apace  despite obstacles raised by one of the four factions to move into the second phase of implementation. We welcome this advance and commend the intense and diverse attempts by the United Nations to nurture national reconciliation to foster the democratic process and to build peace and stability. In our own small way  as a part of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)  Bangladesh is committed to end the suffering of the Cambodian people and to allow them to determine freely their own destiny. The vicious cycle of starvation  factional fighting  the break-down of central authority  the violence and the exodus of refugees in Somalia has shocked the world. The response has been belated. We fully support the Security Council decision to strengthen the United Nations peace-keeping presence so as to break this cycle through a comprehensive programme of action that could reach vital relief assistance  consolidate the cease-fire  curtail violence and bring about national reconciliation. We also welcome the efforts of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Arab League to convene a conference on national reconciliation and unity in Somalia. The upheaval in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a cause of utmost concern. It has unleashed a bitter mix of conflict  ambition  hatred and ethnic brutality. The August 1992 London Conference and the mechanisms it has instituted remain a vital hope for the intensification of the search for solutions in all aspects and on a continuous basis. Meanwhile  the world is appalled by the Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina  by the massacre of innocent civilians  the systematic persecution and even annihilation through the abhorrent policy of ""ethnic cleansing"". Bangladesh has taken a forthright stand in all international forums to condemn these acts. It has joined in the call for more decisive and resolute action that would reverse the aggression  stop the brutality  and ensure the unhindered supply of relief. We have also denied the claim of Serbia and Montenegro to be the successor State of former Yugoslavia in the United Nations and other international bodies. We believe that much more needs to be done to end the bloodshed and fully restore the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We remain steadfast in our support for the people of South Africa in their struggle to achieve their cherished goal of equal rights and majority rule. There can be no compromise until we have achieved the complete dismantling of apartheid. The international community must remain vigilant in its efforts to bring an effective end to the recent outbreak of violence and create conditions for negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic  non-racial and united South Africa. Bangladesh welcomes the intensification of efforts to find a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem. We commend the Secretary-General for his personal initiatives a¬ªid role in the difficult process of reaching agreement on a broad-based set of ideas leading towards an overall framework agreement. We hope that the leaders of the two communities who are to meet on 26 October 1992 will pursue direct and uninterrupted negotiations to reach an amicable and durable solution that will serve the legitimate interests of both communities. In Western Sahara  we fully support the Secretary-General's initiatives to reactivate the implementation of the settlement plan and to help overcome differences over criteria of eligibility to vote. We hope that the referendum can be effectively organized and supervised and thus bring about an early end to this long-standing dispute. In other parts of the third world  bilateral  regional and international efforts have seen many positive initiatives and advances. It is the combined solidarity and sustained moral pressure of the world community that has created a climate conducive to peaceful change. The enhanced role and contribution of the International Court of Justice also now assumes much greater relevance and credibility and must be strengthened. Let me say in conclusion that the world has reached a critical point in its struggle to advance stability and well-being. No doubt violence  aggression  foreign occupation  narrowly conceived nationalism  racial and religious discrimination and gaping social and economic disparities still persist. Yet there is today greater confidence and conviction that a better world is truly within our reach. We are faced with an opportunity rare in the history of civilization to carry forward the momentum to resolve disputes peacefully  to promote partnership and responsible relations among States  to strengthen the rule of law and uplift the quality of life of all peoples in greater freedom. We must surely move with deliberation towards the realization of what the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  calls ""the vast potential of this unique Organization to bring new life to the world of the Charter."" (A/47/1  para. 170) "
"16",673,"BGR",47,1992,"Mr. President  at the outset I should like to express our deep thanks to all delegations of Member States for the uananimous decision to confer the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly upon us. That can be conceived as an application of the rules of procedure  which provide that the presidency of the forty-seventh session will be given to a representative of Eastern Europe. However  I should also like to see it as support knowingly given for all that our people have done to ensure that Bulgaria would remain an example in the difficult transition from dictatorship towards normalcy. I should also like to express my delegation's gratitude to Ambassador Samir Shihabi for his valuable contributions to achievements of the forty-sixth session. On behalf of my country I am pleased to welcome the new States Members of the United Nations. We hope that other peace-loving States prepared to implement the principles of the Organization will make their contributions. The Organization's work has now been going on without interruption  albeit with ups and downs  for 47 years. Today  we are happy to be able to say that it is entering a new stage. The aggressive communist system that had set itself the goal of spreading its colour over the entire planet no longer exists. The peoples under its domination paid dearly for that experiment. State  economic and social structures are in ruins  and the environment been degraded. When we add the new investments needed to divert to satisfying the real needs of society the vast military machinery and weapons stockpiles that were accumulated we cannot help but exclaim to ourselves: What a waste of resources! The common denominator of communism's deeds is the wasting of millions of human lives. People have been killed  tortured  mutilated and removed from active life. Let us pay tribute to them  for through their suffering history has once again demonstrated that although violence may well create empires  it cannot preserve them. In assessing today the United Nations place in human civilization we recall that our inheritance from the Roman Empire was not the frontiers established by its legions but Roman law  Roman architecture and Roman philosophy all products of the thinking of the people of that era. The same holds true for the Eastern or colonial empires. Reason alone leaves lasting fruits. The failure of the badly brought up and poorly educated who have tried to govern the world has provided further proof of this. It is unnecessary to come up with lengthy treatises to understand that throughout the succession of different forms of social organization the institutions that last are those that ensure the best opportunities for thought to emerge  spread  endure and evolve. Thought knows no local or international boundaries. It creates links across space and time. It truly unites nations. The best way to give a new impetus to the United Nations is to work to transform it into an Organization of united minds. Only the individual can create a thought. Even with the traditional predominance of the State in society  we must recognize that it is the human being who bears the responsibility for maintaining parliamentary democracy and the effective production of goods. The protection of the human rights of each human being must be the fundamental condition for accepting any State into the United Nations family. Today  as we assess the 47 years that have gone by and seek new directions  we see that compromise in this area is very costly and the price is not paid only by those in the Gulag Archipelago; it is paid by everyone. We know that totalitarian regimes provoke domestic and international crises and that their authoritarian decisions threaten nature and sometimes even mankind's survival. I should like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who submitted his report  ""An Agenda for Peace "" at a time when a new atmosphere prevails within the United Nations. The Bulgarian delegation warmly welcomes his message  which is designed to guide the Organization towards efficiency and concrete results. It goes without saying that the fundamental condition for the reform proposed by the Secretary-General is the bridging of the gap between the declarations of States and their true policies. The Bulgarian delegation supports the principal ideas in ""An Agenda for Peace"" and welcomes the fact that a ""constructive discussion on that basis has been initiated at the present session. We consider it would be useful to create a special working group to accelerate the evaluation of comments and proposals submitted by Member States. For the Bulgarian delegation the link between international peace  development and respect for human rights is basic. That link exists in the Charter  and it was emphasized at the Security Council Summit Meeting on 31 January 1992. We should have it constantly in our minds when discussing ideas of preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and peacemaking. Preventive diplomacy is a necessity  and the Secretary-General must be supported in his efforts to develop that concept and give it practical dimensions. In this connection there is a whole range of activities that might be considered  such as: information-gathering on problems that may provoke conflicts; the establishment of contacts with forces that may become involved in conflict; the dispatch of fact-finding or other missions  both long-term and short-term; the sending of special representatives; the deployment of civilian or military observers; and  lastly  the deployment of military troops should the need arise. United Nations efforts in the realm of preventive diplomacy  crisis-management and post-conflict peace-building must also include a greater and more effective cooperation with regional organizations. We support the Secretary-General's idea of making better use of the potential of regional organizations. In our view this entails creating a system to coordinate the efforts of agencies working at both the global and regional levels. As of now  there could be such coordination with regard to the sending of fact-finding missions or special rapporteurs  or to similar measures. We believe that interesting ideas may emerge from a discussion of the opportunities available to the United Nations to delegate certain functions to regional organizations as provided in Chapter VIII of the Charter. At the same time  we must not forget that the supreme responsibility for the maintenance of peace has been entrusted to the United Nations. We consider very useful the experience already acquired through the work of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). As an example  let us take the establishment of the post of High Commissioner on National Minorities  whose tasks could well be considered to come within the field of preventive diplomacy  or all the confidence-building measures drafted in the course of the Helsinki process  including the recently signed ""Open Skies"" Treaty. Here I might mention a measure proposed by the Bulgarian delegation at the Vienna negotiations  and already successfully tried  which is to invite accredited military attaches to visit zones of tension in the country where they are posted. With necessary adjustments  when feasible  many of these measures could acguire universal status. We feel that the reverse process could also be employed. The notion of creating a universal register of conventional arms could also be implemented at the regional level to prevent quantities of conventional weapons capable of destabilizing a region from being stockpiled without any preventive control. Regional registers would not only ensure increased transparency  but would also assist in the creation and functioning of a world register. Bulgaria reaffirms its commitment to the implementation of resolution 46/36 L  ""Transparency in armaments."" The reform of the United Nations cannot take place without strengthening confidence among States. Continuation of the disarmament process is absolutely necessary if the new climate in the world is to be maintained. We pay a tribute to Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin for having taken courageous steps to reduce offensive nuclear weapons and to diminish the risk of a nuclear holocaust. We hope that they will continue their efforts and carry this process to its completion. Encouraged by the success achieved in nuclear disarmament and knowing that regional conflicts are still raging  we feel that it is time to take a decisive step to resolve the problem of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As a State party to the non-proliferation Treaty  Bulgaria knows its value and supports the efforts to make it universal. We are in favour of having it continue in force indefinitely after 1995. We participated in the drafting of the Convention on chemical weapons which we expect to see adopted at this session. From this lofty rostrum I should like to confirm Bulgaria's will to be among the first countries to sign the Convention and to work for its entry into force as quickly as possible. In putting forth efforts to prevent world war  we must not forget that regional wars are raging. Whether we speak about Iraq  Somalia  on Bosnia and Herzegovina  the malady is universal  even if solutions can only be individual. Since the beginning of the Yugoslav crisis  Bulgaria has adopted a position aimed at preventing the conflict from spreading and at cooperating with the international community in efforts to find a political solution to the conflict. We participated in the London Conference  which stimulated international efforts by launching a process of negotiations under the  auspices of the United Nations and the European Community. Bulgaria firmly supports the principles drafted by the Conference because we feel that they are the basis for a lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict. Bulgaria has recognized all of the Republics which  in accordance with constitutional procedures  have clearly expressed their desire to become sovereign States. That makes it possible to bring all the parties of the former Federation together round a negotiating table but if one or two of them were to be absent  it would be impossible to do so. We have therefore recognized the existing international borders  showing clearly that we are not getting ready to take advantage of our neighbour's difficulties for nationalist purposes. At this time it is extremely important to contain the conflict and to prevent its spread. The Bulgarian Government has decided to continue to work together with the international community in carrying out the decisions of the London Conference and of the Security Council. An additional but effective way is to deploy international observer missions. Since the end of last year  the Bulgarian Government has declared several times that it was ready to accept such a mission on its territory. We support the decision taken by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) to send missions to the neighbouring countries of Serbia and Montenegro and we pay a tribute to the mission of the European Community which is in Bulgaria. I should like to recall that we invited another special mission of the European Community and of the CSCE to lend assistance to our authorities in the implementation of Security Council resolutions imposing economic sanctions and the embargo on imports of weapons into the former Yugoslavia. And while we are speaking of sanctions  I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the fact that they also affect the countries which apply them. Whether we talk about the case of Iraq  Libya or the former Yugoslavia  a large number of Bulgarian enterprises have been seriously affected and our entire economy has suffered serious losses. If we wish to punish only the guilty party  it would be only fair to consider setting up a compensation programme for the non-guilty party. Bulgaria will continue its efforts to organize a conference to reaffirm the applicability in the Balkans of the principles of the CSCE. The Bulgarian initiative for a Balkan forum is a concrete example of the general principles of the Helsinki Final Act  as applied to the actual conditions in the Balkans. In this context the setting up and carrying out of a special programme for the economic recovery of the Balkan States  a kind of ""Marshall Plan""  is of prime importance. Bulgaria is working to establish relations with neighbouring States on a stable legal basis. We have concluded treaties of friendship  cooperation and good-neighbourliness with Greece  Turkey and Romania  and we are now in the process of signing such a treaty with Albania  Slovenia and Croatia. We wish to live in peace and a state of good-neighbourliness with all the peoples in our region  including the Serbian and Montenegrin peoples with whom we have long historic ties. We hope that  as soon as possible  they will once again find their place in this Hall. That would be the best sign that the problems have already been resolved. The death of thousands of people and the suffering of millions of others  especially women  children and the elderly  the huge flows of refugees  and the barbaric practice of ethnic cleansing must not be forgotten. These flagrant violations of humanitarian international law have eloquently shown the overriding need to create an international penal court which would have the competence to judge individuals who commit crimes against peace and humanity. Perhaps it would be appropriate to analyse the possibilities of using for these purposes one of the permanent courts already in existence the International Court of Justice or the European Court of Human Rights. In any case  this requires discussion and Bulgaria favours continuing the work of the International Law Commission on drawing up the draft statute for such a court. We think that after the cold war it is imperative to strengthen the role of international law in international relations. This is necessary  in our view  because the bipolar structure of international relations has disappeared and therefore it is necessary to replace it with clear  precise  legal rules which are also universally recognized. On that basis  we should  in our opinion  promote above all  the strict implementation of the provisions of the Charter and strengthen the role of the United Nations in international affairs. Bulgaria energetically supports all actions and measures which have been laid down in the biennial programme for the United Nations Decade of International Law. We are convinced that the most important part of the programme is the part dealing with ways and means to bring about the peaceful settlement of international disputes. In this context  I should like to inform representatives that on 23 June 1992 the Bulgarian Government deposited with the Secretary-General a Declaration of Acceptance of the binding jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Furthermore  on that same day we withdrew our reservations on the jurisdictional provisions of a number of international conventions  such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimation  the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages  and others. I should like to extend the Bulgarian delegation's support for the recommendation of the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 38 of his report ""An Agenda for Peace""  namely that the General Assembly could  pursuant to Article 96  paragraph 2  of the Charter  authorize the Secretary-General to take advantage of the advisory competence of the International Court of Justice. Such a possibility would considerably strengthen the effectiveness of the work of the Secretary- General. I began my statement with some thoughts about the role of man as the only being capable of using reason and of original thought. Honour and dignity are inherent in each human being  and history shows us that all conflicts are more or less linked to violations of human rights. Our Organization has created very good standards in this field and emphasis must now be placed on improving the machinery for monitoring and implementing existing standards. The crises that have followed the disintegration of multinational federations have demonstrated the importance of the problems of ethnic and religious minorities within the overall framework of human rights protection. In this context  my country is deeply concerned over the fate of the Bulgarian minority in Serbia. Although it is not directly affected by the war  this population has a justified feeling of insecurity with regard to its future and identity  and should not be forgotten by the international community. Democratic Bulgaria has succeeded in finding an original and effective approach to solving these problems. The Bulgarian Turks have their representatives in the national parliament  and bear their share of the responsibility for the future of our country. Ethnic tolerance is a characteristic trait of the Bulgarian people; one of the most telling example is the way the Jews in Bulgaria were rescued during the Second World War. The words ""war"" and ""peace"" have been intermingled in my speech  as they are  moreover  in real life. But it is clear that peace will win out in the end  because it is in peace that man shows himself to be reasonable and creative. Those who preach peace still remain among us; those who cry violence are not. That is why  in Bulgaria  we have said a last farewell to communism and sided with the nations that are united in their way of thinking. "
"17",718,"BHR",47,1992,"Allow me  Mr. President  at the outset  to express to you my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to salute your friendly country  Bulgaria. In wishing you success in conducting the proceedings of this session  it gives me pleasure to assure you of our readiness to cooperate closely with you in furthering the Organization's objectives and upholding its principles at a time of rapid change in the world order marked by an increasingly important role for the United Nations in addressing world problems is gaining new momentum. I also seize the opportunity to extend our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Ambassador Samir Shihabi  the Permanent Representative of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the able and judicious manner in which he guided our work as president of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is also my pleasure to voice our appreciation of the efforts of His Excellency Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations during the short period since he took office  both in restructuring the Organization and in strengthening its role in the maintenance of world peace and security. It is gratifying indeed to witness the emergence  this year  of a large number of independent States and their accession to membership of the United Nations. The emergence of those thirteen States  is telling proof of the strength of their people's nationalist sentiments and aspirations  which have surged with the end of the cold war. My country's delegation has the pleasure to welcome the new Member States. We are convinced that they will contribute constructively to the enhancement of the United Nations role and the furtherance of its goals and objectives. This session is convened at a time the likes of which the world Organization has rarely witnessed throughout its history. The winds of change have swept away the very foundations of an international system which  for nearly half a century  was based on the foundation of the cold war's precarious balance of power. The ideological barrier between East and West has been brought down and  with it  the strategies of nuclear deterrence upon which the leaders of the bipolar world political order depended throughout the post-Second World War era. Our world today is in a state of flux. It is emerging from a past that is now collapsing under our eyes and is moving towards a future that has not taken shape yet. Intimations of that future are being brought home to us on the crests of mighty waves and the winds of heavy storms that have brought down the Berlin wall  caused the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the dismantling of the Soviet Union side by side with the many developments and conflicts we now witness on the international arena. Although the features of the new world order broke forth sharply in waves of violent and profound transformations  the winds of change have not been able to uproot the problems of the cold war. For in the wake of the fall of certain States  there was the eruption of severe national and ethnic disputes on which the lid had been kept by the bipolar balance of power. Scrutiny of the changes witnessed by the world today clearly reveals that the threads of past and present are interwoven even though developments are taking place so fast towards the creation of a delicate and precarious balance between the status quo and change as the new world order unfolds. The gap between the realities of the present and forecasts of the future is engulfed in ambiguity and uncertainty at this historic juncture which we watch with apprehension and with hope and expectation  for it is our aspiration that man will finally achieve on this planet what he failed to achieve during the cold-war-era. It behooves us to watch out for developments and be prepared for them in a manner conducive to the creation of a climate in which the rights of States  both small and large  are safeguarded  their security strengthened and a role ensured for each and every one of them in determining the future course of humanity. Therefore  we should all endeavour to come to grips with the world in this new stage and identify the role each of us should play in the formulation of that world's features and the laying of its foundations. Without such a collective partnership on the part of all members of the international community  the world will continue to lack equilibrium and stability and remain vulnerable to upheavals and setbacks that could undermine the very foundations of the future. In the context of those international changes  the United Nations has been able to regain some of its vitality and effectiveness in the international arena over the past few years. It has exerted commendable efforts to end the Iraq/Iran war  bring about the liberation of Kuwait  solve the problem of Afghanistan and bring about the independence of Namibia. Its efforts continue in connection with the questions of Western Sahara  Cyprus  Cambodia  El Salvador  South Africa  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia. The future role of the United Nations should be one that rises to the level of contemporary international challenges so that the Organization may be able to influence the course of international politics and deal with transformations that involve interaction of regional and international factors and controversies. Consequently  it is our view that the role of the United Nations should evolve to embrace the following three major tasks: First  the creation of an advanced mechanism that would enable the United Nations to carry out the tasks of achieving international peace and security in a manner that would be compatible with transformations in the international arena; Secondly  the creation of a modus operandi for cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations in the maintenance of international peace and security  the peaceful settlement of international disputes and respect for States' sovereignty and territorial integrity; Thirdly  adequate development of the role of the United Nations in dealing with world problems that constitute a common concern for the international community as a whole and are sources of anxiety to people throughout the world  such as the problems of development  the environment  refugees  famine  poverty and a host of other international questions. The question of world peace and security with its economic and social roots has given rise to a new multifaceted vision of international security. Undoubtedly  the overlapping and intertwining of such issues require serious action on our part to coordinate policies and develop programmes for United Nations organs so that they may be able to meet changing world needs. In response to the recommendation by the Security Council in its meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government  held on 31 January 1992  the Secretary-General of the United Nations presented his report ""An Agenda for Peace"". It contains important recommendations and ideas that aim at developing the international Organization's political performance through preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. The concept of preventive diplomacy is a new strategy based on good forecasting and early intervention by the United Nations to prevent the eruption of conflicts and to prevent the escalation to the level of hostilities of existing conflicts. In this context  we should like to commend the role played by United Nations peace-keeping operations  a role that has proved to be effective in containing conflicts  defusing tensions and maintaining peace in various regions of the world. Since 1987  13 peace-keeping operations have been undertaken. It is incumbent upon the international community  especially now  to bolster and enhance the United Nations financial and operational capability in this field so that it may be able to maintain its leadership in peace-keeping  bearing in mind that the cooperation of States Members of the United Nations is the key factor that would enable those forces to achieve their objectives and the only guarantee that they will be able to do so. Peacemaking  peace-keeping  and preventive diplomacy are undoubtedly interrelated and mutually complementary. We believe that the concept of post-conflict peace-building introduced by the Secretary-General  together with the preceding concepts  form an important stanchion of the Organization's future role in the area of promoting peaceful solutions and preventing the recurrence of conflicts. In this context  the United Nations can cooperate with and benefit from the potential and abilities of regional organizations and arrangements in the peaceful resolution of disputes among Member States  bearing in mind that most of the disputes that threaten international peace and security are of a regional nature. The role of regional organizations in peace-keeping is consonant with the objectives of the United Nations Charter. It is also called for by current international developments. And yet  for four decades now  the United Nations has not been able to benefit from the capabilities of regional organizations because of the cold war. That cooperation is of singular importance. Its importance is highlighted now by the aggravation of discord in parts of Eastern Europe and other parts of the world under the influence of ethnic sentiments  territorial claims and border disputes. It is in this area that the United Nations  in cooperation with the appropriate regional organizations  could use the tool of preventive diplomacy to prevent the eruption of tragic ethnic conflicts  futile border hostilities  the occupation by force of other peoples' territories  or the changing of existing boundaries. In concert with the principles and objectives which we seek to consolidate within the framework of the United Nations  our responsibility lies in maintaining the momentum generated by the new international climate of respect for international legality with a view to achieving stability in sensitive regional situations  foremost among which is that in the Gulf area. In this respect  the State of Bahrain reiterates its demand that United Nations resolutions relating to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait be complied with. The State of Bahrain has been following with deep concern the recent unfortunate developments in the Gulf area as a result of the actions by the Islamic Republic of Iran on the island of Abu Mousa. While we emphasize the sovereignty and territorial rights of the United Arab Emirates  our adherence to the good-neighbourliness principle and our desire to avoid any further tensions in the area  we call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by the memorandum of understanding it has signed with the United Arab Emirates. For the past several years  international relations have undergone enormous transformations in the political and economic fields that herald a pattern of new economic cooperation among countries. There are expectations that with the end of confrontation between the two super-Powers  the world will enter an era of fruitful cooperation between States. Yet an escalation of the confrontation in the economic arena  a widening of the gap between the North and South  and the prevalence of extreme poverty in a number of developing countries continue to endanger world security and stability. Peace and development are the most important foundations of our civilization at present. It is therefore incumbent upon the United Nations  which has had about half a century of experience in international organization  to undertake side by side with the task of peace-keeping  the task of promoting development in the developing countries. The United Nations is qualified to be the forum for the elaboration of international development strategies and the provision of appropriate political impetus for a number of such interrelated economic issues as the problems of debt  the transfer of technology  trade  finance  commodities  and the environment. It is thus essential to reactivate the role of the United Nations in the field of economic development for the peoples of the world. Although the United Nations designated the 1970s and the 1980s as the second and third Decades for development  it has failed to achieve the objectives thereof due to lack of funds to finance the plan. If rich industrial countries are to fulfil their global responsibilities  they ought to respond to the needs of developing countries in terms of development assistance so that the cold war between the East and West may not be replaced by another cold war between the North and South or  as the Secretary-General put it  so as not to erect an iron curtain between the North and South similar to the one that used to exist between the East and West. In the light of this situation  the State of Bahrain  as a member of the Economic and Social Council  a major organ of the United Nations  believes that the Council's role should be reinvigorated if it is to fulfil its mandate as provided for in Article 65 of the Charter  and if it is to furnish the Security Council with comprehensive reports on the economic situations in the world's different countries. It is clear that if such situations were left to fester and deteriorate  they may indirectly threaten international peace and security. A number of important international conferences have been held this year  most significant of which ¬ªere the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held in Colombia  and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development which was held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and which culminated in the issuance of the Rio Declaration  Agenda 21  and other international agreements relating to environment and development. The Rio Declaration  with its 27 principles  recognizes the integral interrelated character of the Earth and links sustainable development to environmental protection. Agenda 21 reflects a global consensus on cooperation in the areas of environment and development and aims at addressing urgent problems in that respect and at equipping the world with the means to rise to the challenges of the next century. The fact that these two Conference were held in relatively quick succession demonstrates the enormous capability of the United Nations to conduct political dialogue in the areas of development and international economic cooperation. In order for the United Nations role to be strengthened in that respect. Member States should provide the Organization with the wherewithal to enable it fully to perform its mandated tasks. For wherewithal  read: the political will. In the midst of international transformations  many peoples look forward to a secure future for themselves and for their future generations. I must voice here the hope of my delegation that peace may prevail in the Middle East. We welcome the signs that may lead to a just settlement of the question of Palestine in particular and of the Middle East conflict in general. The rounds of talks  which started in Madrid late in October 1991  have vividly demonstrated the earnest nature of Arab positions and the commitment of Arab negotiators to achieving a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East on the basis of the land-for-peace formula in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions. It is imperative to intensify international efforts to induce Israel to forswear its policies of expansion and settlement-building in the occupied Arab territories  to recognize the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people  to withdraw from the Syrian Golan Heights  to withdraw from southern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  and to respond to all constructive disarmament proposals which  if implemented  could bring about parity in military capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively and ensure security through equal commitments applicable to all Middle East States  including Israel. In this connection  I would like to reiterate our support for freeing the Middle East region from all weapons of mass destruction  and reaffirm our readiness to deal with the proposed convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons  to the extent that other States in the region are willing to respond to international demands by acceding to that convention  to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to the international system of safeguards and inspections on the basis of equity and equality  in the interests of the security of all States of the region without discrimination. The human tragedy that has befallen the Somali people  and the degradation of their human dignity  call for immediate mobilization of the concerted efforts of the international community to put an end to that tragedy. Medical assistance and food supplies should be provided urgently to save the Somali people from their painful plight. We welcome the United Nations efforts in Somalia  and are of the opinion that an appropriate political mechanism should be created to put an end to the bloodshed  to effect national reconciliation  to eliminate the causes of strife between the warring factions and to help achieve security and stability in Somalia. We also wish to express our deep concern over the tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  whose people are the targets of mass annihilation and human-rights violations. At a time when the world looks forward to the emergence of a new world order in which peace and security would prevail  we believe the United Nations is duty-bound to act resolutely to put an end to this tragic situation and to preserve the integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  a State Member of the United Nations. South Africa  which is going through a delicate phase of its history  requires special attention on the part of the international community. Despite the positive reforms initiated last year by the Pretoria Government with a view to drawing up a new constitution for South Africa  it is urgent that apartheid be completely eradicated by means of constitutional reforms guaranteeing the participation of the majority of the people of South Africa in building a non-racial State. In that connection  we support United Nations efforts to put an end to violence and to help create favourable conditions for negotiations on transforming South Africa into a non-racial  unitary State. The Cyprus problem has eluded solution for a long time. However  there have been signs recently that may lead to a solution. We welcome the new positive movements as well as the Secretary-General's efforts in that direction. The peoples of the world look forward with full confidence to a new world in which security and prosperity prevail. Yet  despite our hopes for the future  threats to the human race and the environment abound. Unless we all work to overcome those threats and to address their causes  we will be opening a Pandora's box  releasing all its evils while leaving hope locked inside. The success of the United Nations in dealing with the new challenges will depend on its ability to build confidence among nations and  with the help of a broad creative vision  to mobilize efforts  resources and knowledge with a view to bringing them to bear on the transformation of world society into a society in which real security  peace  tranquility and equality may prevail. If we may liken the desired world order to a ship  then peace  security and economic development are the canvas of which its sails are made; international legality is its pennant; and only through stability can it sail to safety. It behoves us to work together in weaving the yarn to make the canvas of the sails  and to steer our ship toward a secure future for all our peoples. "
"18",756,"BHS",47,1992,"I congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are certain that his diplomatic skills and considerable experience will lead us to historic conclusions. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Samir S. Shihabi  Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia  for the excellent manner in which he presided over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. In his short time in office our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has inspired our confidence that he has the qualities essential to perform the duties of chief executive of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment to this high office last year. I assure him of the continued cooperation of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas during this session of the General Assembly  as he leads a United Nations challenged to reaffirm its fundamental purposes and principles  and obliged to redefine its role and function in this world of unprecedented change. The Bahamas warmly welcomes those States that have joined the United Nations since our last session of the General Assembly. In just six days on 12 October we who live in the Western Hemisphere will mark the five-hundredth anniversary of the encounter between the old world and the new  which comes at a most pivotal time in modern history. It all began on one of the many islands of the Bahamas  now called San Salvador  and we are pleased to mark this historic occasion. On a number of occasions during that 500-year interval these worlds referred to as East and West have encountered each other in angry and even bloody disagreement  and sometimes those disagreements have resulted in a cold separation of peoples  countries and cultures. The quincentennial presents an opportunity and an invitation to East and West to re-enact that initial encounter in a way that is relative and meaningful to the nations and the cultures of the twentieth and the twenty-first centuries for mutual benefit and for global preservation. The present-day inhabitants of the Bahamas  like those of 1492  are a peace-loving and hospitable people. Small though we are in population  we firmly believe in the significance of the role we can play in achieving the peaceful coexistence of nations and environmental preservation. In that belief  I extend a warm and cordial invitation to all the nations represented here to come and see and experience the peace and tranquillity of the country where that encounter took place 500 years ago. Today I address the Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas to reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to pledge my Government's cooperation as we seek to ensure that our Organization maintains its objectives and enhances its effectiveness in international affairs. The winds of political change  stirred by the innate desire of the electorate for democratic representation and the concomitant responsibility of those elected  did not bypass the Bahamas. The Bahamian people once again demonstrated their long tradition of  and unswerving commitment to  the democratic process when in the most dramatic yet tranquil manner  in the words of Aldous Huxley  a ""brave new world"" was ushered into the lives of Bahamians  and a new administration  the Government of the Free National Movement (FNM)  was democratically elected only seven weeks ago  on 19 August. That signal event heralded a new era in Bahamian history. It is a reinvigorated Bahamas that is now poised to take its place in this emerging new political arena. Our vision is of a world free of tension  thus enabling us to deliver to our people a new kind of freedom and social and economic justice. This year natural disasters have occurred worldwide  exacting high tolls on human life and the destruction of property and natural resources. Just recently the Bahamas endured the ravages of Hurricane Andrew  which caused severe damage $250 million-worth to several islands of the Bahamas  resulting in a tragic loss of life and leaving more than 1 200 persons homeless. I wish on behalf of my Government to thank all those countries and international organizations  as well as many  many individual friends  for coming to the aid of the Bahamas as we begin the task of reconstruction. At the same time  we extend our sympathy to the Governments and people of the United States of America  China  Nicaragua and Pakistan for the devastation and loss of life inflicted upon their countries by recent natural disasters. All our countries face potential natural hazards. But natural hazards  no matter how great  need not result in natural disasters. We often spend too much time and money recovering from disasters and too little on prevention. Widespread upheavals and conflicts  within States and between States  have been responsible for the mass movement of persons from one country to the other. This phenomenon not only threatens the security and stability of the affected countries  but also creates competing demands for attention and vital resources. This Organization must not be perceived as selective in mediating problems of a political nature  nor as elevating the suffering of one group of people over that of another. In our region  the critical situation in Haiti demands urgent international attention. Almost two years ago  the people of Haiti spoke for democracy. But the unconstitutional seizure of power by the military has subverted the popular will. The great expectations which the world had for Haiti under a democratically elected Government were dashed. Political unrest  economic deprivation and poverty have caused a mass exodus of its people  who are fleeing their homeland in unprecedented numbers and thereby placing an unacceptably high burden on neighbouring countries  particularly the Bahamas. I now make a plea for the people of Haiti. We call on the international community to come to the aid of Haiti. It must be appreciated that no matter how grave our disillusionments over the plight of the Haitian people  no matter how solicitous our efforts to understand and to help  and no matter how expansive our Christian charity in this whole unfortunate affair  the Bahamas has a priority responsibility for the welfare of the Bahamian people. In the comprehensive Manifesto on which the Governing Party in the Bahamas was swept into power in August this year  we reaffirmed our commitment to that priority  and it is necessary that our sister nations in this Organization fully understand the Bahamas' position on the matter. For almost three decades the Bahamas has been subjected to this serious problem of illegal Haitian immigration. The presence of large numbers of illegal immigrants in the Bahamas has created unexpected demands on the country's economic  health and welfare agencies. This situation cannot continue  and the Bahamas :an no longer afford to be penalized by the situation simply because of our geographical position. The Bahamas supports the efforts of the Organization of American States (OAS) to negotiate a settlement to the situation in Haiti. Fully appreciative of the practical limits to action by the OAS  the Bahamas advocates and supports United Nations efforts aimed at strengthening OAS initiatives and finding a solution to this problem. The Bahamas wishes to place on record its deep appreciation for the continuing assistance which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has rendered to us in the difficulties caused us by this problem. We implore all concerned to continue to pursue all peaceful means to reach a comprehensive settlement of the Haitian situation. I should also like to decry the problems of drug abuse  drug trafficking and the illicit production of drugs  which continue to haunt the international community with their catastrophic effects on our individual societies. The creation of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme has been our most recent collective step to strengthen  improve and rationalize the legal and institutional framework for control of the production  trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. My Government wishes to affirm its support for the Programme and its efforts in providing valuable assistance to countries fighting this menace. However  a most significant element in the fight against the drug trade is the requisite cooperation between States. My Government pledges to continue its collaboration with our neighbours to fight against the drug menace. In this regard  we wish to thank the Governments of the United States of America and Canada for the assistance they have rendered to the Bahamas. The world breathed a sigh of relief earlier this year when it appeared that talks between the Government of South Africa and the African National Congress gave promise of establishing a political solution to the problems of South Africa. The Bahamas deeply regrets that the process of dialogue has been interrupted. We condemn the massacre at Boipatong and other massacres of innocent civilians  as we equally condemn the efforts by the South African Government to delay the realization of majority rule in South Africa. The United Nations has been a critical force in opposing the abhorrent system of apartheid in South Africa and in moving that country towards a non-racial  unitary and democratic society. The role of the United Nations is even more critical since the lifting of sanctions by many influential States. The United Nations must not fail the people of South Africa at this critical moment. My country strongly supports the phased lifting of sanctions agreed by States members of the Commonwealth  and it firmly supports the effort that the United Nations is making to encourage the resumption of negotiations towards a new constitution for South Africa and ending the violence which threatens a total disruption of these negotiations. The Earth Summit held in Rio in June of this year was a historic beginning. The fact that wore than 118 world leaders attended is a measure of the seriousness with which the global community is viewing the question of the environment. It is perhaps a trite truism to observe that the survival of the human family depends to a great extent on how this generation protects the natural environment. The positive results achieved by the Summit were due in large measure to the cooperation fostered by the United Nations. Real success  however  will be judged by the abilities of countries to carry out programmes at the national level. Tins can come about only when national capacities are strengthened and additional resources are available. We must therefore continue to maintain the vision and basic principles of multilateral cooperation. The Bahamas therefore welcomes the decision to establish a United Nations commission on sustainable development to monitor the follow-up action after Rio. The Bahamas  an archipelagic State of pristine aquamarine water  with a vibrant tourist industry  is committed to the protection of its own natural environment as well as the promotion of the global environment. My Government sees eco-tourism as a powerful instrument for sustainable development of the Bahamas  and we are fully committed to protection of the environment. The Bahamas therefore gives its assurance that it will scrupulously abide by the conventions signed at Rio  and its commitment to sustainable development remains absolute. The World Economic Survey of 1992 indicates that world output has declined for the first time since the Second World War. World trade has experienced slow growth. Countries continue to wrestle with economic recession and the decline in world financial markets. Failure to complete the Uruguay Round of negotiations will undoubtedly lead to increased protectionism. These are areas of concern to us all  as are the uncertainties prevailing in world markets with regard to the future course of interest rates. These introduce many constraints on investment capital flows and consequently on the growth of developing countries in particular. In spite of all these problems and uncertainties  the performance of the world economy can be improved through the enhancement of international cooperation and policy coordination  which must now be a principal objective of the United Nations. The United Nations has become the centre of a diplomatic revolution  one that mirrors the revitalization of national political institutions in many countries. Fundamental changes not only promise greater personal freedom and more dynamic societies  but frequently provide new challenges which create uncertainty in international relations. The United Nations will have to adopt a new strategy for addressing these challenges. Today  we live in a world of much lowered ideological tension  a world in which representative democracy is of fundamental importance. Indeed  the renewal in many parts of the world of the democratic process implies greater respect for human rights. In that regard  the United Nations must play a catalytic role in ensuring that human rights are assured. We have also come better to understand the relationship between respect for human rights and our search for economic and social development  and we must measure that development by actual improvements in human lives and not exclusively in monetary terms. We are hopeful that the greatly changed international environment and the renewal of interest worldwide in human rights will contribute to the success of the World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for 1993. In this regard my Government has undertaken to give early consideration to all of the human rights conventions to which the Bahamas is not yet a party  including the Covenants relating to economic  social and political rights. The pace of change in international politics is straining mankind's capabilities of assimilation and assessment. In Western Europe the outlines of super-nationalism have become visible. In Central Europe the echoes of history are heralded again after more than 40 years of silence. And in Eastern Europe communism is in full-scale retreat under the implacable pressure of the recognition of its limitations and of rising expectations. In Asia countries that could scarcely feed themselves a generation ago have become tigers of economic competition. Meantime  the spectre of famine remains over the Horn of Africa  demonstrating that not all change is positive. Almost everywhere pluralistic democratic values are surfacing and tending to dominate. In a world of tinder  fire-breaks are needed. The United Nations peace-keeping operations can be considered just such fire-breaks. The support of the international community  both political and material  remains an essential characteristic of peace-keeping operations  regardless of their size. Political support by Governments can mean the difference between a party's compliance with the terms of an agreement and serious infractions that jeopardize lives and progress towards peace. The price of United Nations peace-keeping is  by monetary standards  a bargain. But the United Nations is more than just good value. The contributions of the membership are certainly a more cost-effective and humane solution to international disputes than the conflict and human suffering that occur when States feel that they are unable  or are unwilling  to use the machinery offered by the United Nations and resort to war. We welcome the recent pronouncements of the Presidents of the United States of America and of the Russian Federation of 17 June 1992 to reduce their nuclear arsenals below the numbers agreed to last summer during the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty Talks (START) and their joint statement on chemical weapons in which they reiterated their commitment to the global elimination of such weapons. The recently concluded negotiations on a convention banning chemical weapons is a further important step forward in curtailing the use of weapons of mass destruction. Further progress in this area will be determined by the political will of Member States  their commitment to their obligations under existing disarmament agreements  and the more recent agreements  such as the United Nations universal and non-discriminatory Register of Conventional Arms  which became operational on 1 January 1992. The Bahamas remains totally committed to general and complete disarmament. The bedrock for action by the United Nations lies in States adhering to  and consistently applying  the principles of the Charter. It costs money to put principles into practice. Expanded responsibilities translate into greater costs  which must be borne by the States Members of the Organization. In the coming decade it is vital to use in the most effective and efficient manner this Organization  which has demonstrated the importance of its promotional and catalytic role  particularly in bringing to the surface issues which are likely to assume importance in coming years. The creation of a stable and more favourable international environment is fundamental to the strengthening of multilateral policy coordination within an enhanced framework  especially if we are to realize our new vision for an improved new world order. This requires the collective resolve of the giant nations as well as of tiny nations  such as the Bahamas  to work together to remove constraints and to allow for optimum growth and development. The new world order can be lasting only if all constituent elements grow in harmony. A multilateral  concerted and comprehensive approach is vital for the implementation of effective and lasting solutions to global problems. As I noted at the outset  this year's commemoration of the quincentennial in the Bahamas and in the Western hemisphere offers a unique opportunity to make real and meaningful and mutually beneficial that original encounter of the old and new worlds. There are those who condemn that encounter but Columbus did come and as a result a medley of old and new cultures and civilizations emerged. It was fitting that with the coming into being of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945 the Preamble to our Charter reaffirmed our determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and our faith in fundamental human rights  and established conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law should be maintained. In those 47 years  many swords have been beaten into plowshares  and many spears into pruning hooks. It is now left for us to make abidingly true the end of that refrain  that nation shall not lift up sword against nation  neither shall we learn war any more. "
"19",781,"BIH",47,1992,"Let me begin by expressing my sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi for his wise administration and leadership of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. It is also my great pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session and to wish him a successful term. I also want you to know that we  the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina  are deeply grateful to the United Nations for all of its efforts to achieve peace and for providing humanitarian assistance under very difficult circumstances. The courageous troops of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  with the tenacious leadership of Secretary-General  Boutros Boutros-Ghali  deserve special recognition and gratitude. As is well known  I come from a country besieged by barbaric aggression. But  I must emphasize  I have come here today not to talk of war but to offer peace. It is an offer of a nation born of ethnic coexistence rather than ethnic cleansing. It is an offer of a multicultural and multi-religious Bosnia and Herzegovina in which democracy and tolerance prevail. It is not an offer of a unitary or ideological State  as some will have you believe. Some have said that the killing and destruction have caused so much hatred that my country's peoples cannot live together in peace any more. I submit to you that my country has a centuries-old tradition of tolerance and coexistence among its peoples. Just one week ago yesterday I celebrated  together with Muslims  Croats and other groups  the five-hundredth anniversary of the first settlement of Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Because Muslims  Croats  Serbs  Jews and others have lived together in Bosnia and Herzegovina for centuries  virtually all of our towns and cities are mixed in population some more  some less. It is therefore not possible to draw lines through our Republic to designate ethnically pure regions. It is not possible to draw lines through our towns and cities to designate ethnically pure streets or neighborhoods. I submit to you that we  the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina  can live together  and that we must live together  despite what has happened  provided that equality  justice and freedom are secured for all. In recent years  people of many nations have chosen democracy as the best means to secure their rights  to ensure religious and political liberty  to promote cooperation and mutual advancement  to enjoy the fruits of their labours and to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. Their efforts have changed the world: they have opened doors where once there was an iron curtain. This guest for democracy has made an old world order crumble and a new one begin. So  too  have we  the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina  turned to democratic government as the means to assure mutual welfare  regardless of ethnic  religious or other distinctions. Consequently we have sought to build a government that represents all of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina equally and justly. I am proposing a constitutional commission for Bosnia and Herzegovina which includes inter-ethnic and inter-religious representation. The commission will work with a group of international experts to develop a constitutional settlement to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will protect the rights of all citizens. We envision it as encompassing the following: First  a State founded on the principles of democracy  individual rights  tolerance  religious and cultural freedoms and a market economy; Secondly  a constitutional and administrative framework similar to that of modern democratic States; Thirdly  a decentralized State organized on the principles of parliamentary civil democracy; and Fourthly  a single legislative  executive and judicial framework for the whole territory of the Republic  with decentralized administration in all regions. We envision the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as consisting of administrative territorial regions to be formed according to economic  cultural  historical and ethnic criteria. We believe it is impractical and immoral to institute administrative territorial regions on an exclusively ethnic basis. Moreover  it is impossible  because we are an ethnically mixed  intermingled country: a living  breathing Jackson Pollack painting. Government at every level will respect the equal rights of all the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Government will be based on the principle of parity of representation among the three constituent nations. The legislative branch the Assembly will consist of two chambers: the Chamber of Peoples will be based on ethnic parity  being made up of representatives of the three largest constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina; the Chamber of Citizens will be based on proportional representation. All representatives will be elected in free and open elections. The Chamber of Peoples and the Presidency will reach key decisions by consensus  including all decisions that directly affect the equality of the constituent nations. Bosnia and Herzegovina will seek to establish good relations with all neighbouring States  as well as with other States  on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation. I have related my offer of peace. I now want to tell the Assembly about the offer made by the Government in Belgrade and its proxies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By their actions and by their statements  they have made an offer that must be clear to all nations of the world. Their offer is based on an entirely different view of Bosnia and Herzegovina: a view that is alien to democracy  but unfortunately familiar in history. It is a view of people divided  hostile and unequal. First  they offer ""ethnic cleansing""  which is the extermination or elimination of people on the basis of ethnic  national or religious distinctions. Secondly  they offer a brutal division of the Republic along spurious ethnic boundaries created by force and by war. They say that the people Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot live together in one State. But the only evidence they have is the false evidence they have manufactured by their own aggression. Around the world we see diverse peoples living together. How many nations represented here have ethnic purity? Look west from this building and imagine Belgrade's vision applied  for example  to the United States. Imagine Berlin Walls sprouting in every American neighbourhood  separating the French  Russian  African-American  Italian  Jewish  Spanish  Japanese  Polish  Korean  Irish and other groups until all had been moved to ethnically pure neighbourhoods and separated by barbed wire  armed guards and checkpoints. Finally  they offer an expanding Serbia. We know that this will be a Serbia in which those who are not Serbs are denied fundamental freedoms. Their offer leads to endless insecurity  endless conflict  endless suffering. The question  then  is which offer the world will accept today. If it accepts our offer of peace  equality and justice  and if it rejects the offer of pain and division made by Belgrade and its proxies in Bosnia and Herzegovina  then I ask the world community to do three things. First  in front of the entire General Assembly  I ask the members of the Security Council to implement and enforce fully the existing Security Council resolutions and the principles and commitments endorsed at the London Conference. While we have abided by the confidence- and security-building and verification agreement of the London Conference  the aggressors have not. Contrary to their commitments  the aggressors have: failed to place all mortars and heavy weapons under international supervision; failed to cease military air attacks; failed to close concentration camps; failed to allow refugees to return to their homes; failed to allow delivery of relief supplies; and failed to end ""ethnic cleansing"". This record of broken promises shows that implementation and enforcement must become the next step towards peace. It shows  for example  that a no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina is essential for stopping the massive destruction from air attacks. A no-fly zone should be implemented and enforced immediately. Implementation and enforcement are absolutely essential if the Geneva session of the London Conference is to have any chance of success. Secondly  I ask the Assembly to set in motion an international war-crimes tribunal that would work closely with the Geneva Conference. It is essential that we investigate  prosecute and punish those who have been responsible for war crimes. Only after the criminals are punished and the victims healed will we have a true peace. Exonerate the innocent and bring a reconciliation of our people. Thirdly  our country has been plundered and razed. Its economic base has been destroyed. I would like to take this opportunity to request the establishment of an international fund for the reconstruction and development of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Considering the massive scale of the destruction  it is necessary that the world community help us take the first step in emerging from the ruins. Finally  if the Security Council cannot implement and enforce fully its resolutions and if the London Conference cannot implement its principles and agreements  then I ask the world community to allow us to defend ourselves. I have offered a vision of a secular and democratic State  a decentralized State and a multi-ethnic society based on peaceful coexistence and tolerance. Unfortunately  the offer of peace which I have proposed will become irrelevant unless this Organization comes resolutely to our defence or  alternatively  fully enables us to exercise our right to self-defence. The international community cannot simultaneously sidestep its commitment to defend us and nullify our means of self-defence. It has become clear that no one has come resolutely to our aid. We must have the unhindered right of self-defence. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter grants us that absolute right. The present arms embargo ties our hands at a time when our country is being strangled. It deprives us of the only effective means of self-defence. By doing so  it helps the aggressor. The arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina must be voided. "
"20",828,"BLR",47,1992,"Allow me to congratulate you. Sir - the representative of Bulgaria  a State friendly to ours  and of a people so close to the people of Belarus in its spiritual and cultural traditions - on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. By electing you  representatives have paid tribute to Bulgaria and have given expression to the respect that you enjoy in the international community. In the performance of your quite complex duties you may rely on all possible support from our delegation. We should like to express our most sincere congratulations to the States that have become new Members of the United Nations. We regard their entry into the United Nations with great satisfaction since .the accession of new States to membership in the Organization enriches the collective thinking of the international community with the wisdom of each one of them. Happy indeed is a people that reaps the fruits of centuries of steady development development in the context of stable statehood and within a national culture unclouded by oppression. But there is another fate as well that of going through centuries before re-establishing one's own State  without allowing the light of one's culture to be extinguished  and finally achieving the long-awaited goal of sovereignty and independence. This too is happiness - a particular kind of happiness  a difficult happiness. It is precisely the words ""difficult happiness"" that I would use to express the essence of the present mood and feelings experienced by my people. Yakub Kolas  one of the titans of the culture and national spirit of Belarus  in his poem ""New Land""  wrote with tremendous power concerning the everlasting dream of a poor peasant in Belarus about land that would belong only to him  where he would be the master  independent of the caprice of an alien will. Belarus  one of the ancient centres of Slavdom  is a new land  a new country regained by its people. The goals of freedom  of the enjoyment of full ownership rights in one's own country and of liberation from oppression in all of its manifestations have nourished the historic will of our people for centuries and are now beginning to be fully realized. A year ago  at the last session of the General Assembly  the delegation of Belarus  in its statement  outlined the programme of its priorities in the sphere of foreign policy: a series of diplomatic recognitions  the establishment of a commonwealth of sovereign States in place of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  non-nuclear status and neutrality for Belarus. Today  in a brief review of the year  I should like to note with satisfaction that a great deal has been achieved. As we foresaw  the Commonwealth of Independent States born at Viskuli  on the soil of Belarus -has been established in place of the USSR. More than 100 States of the world have recognized the Republic of Belarus  and we have established diplomatic relations with 60 of them. Our State has become a full and equal member of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE); it has joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  as well as other international financial institutions; and it is now the host country for an office of the United Nations and the United Nations Development Programme. Tactical nuclear weapons have been completely withdrawn from Belarus. Having become a party to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and its Lisbon Protocol  Belarus has also committed itself to the withdrawal of strategic weapons over a period of seven years. Possibly the process will be completed even sooner. We have distanced ourselves from participation in military and military-political alliances and blocs. Everything achieved thus far has established for our State a primary foundation  a base from which we can advance further. There are certain invisible threads that link the present and the past into a whole the spiritual potential of culture as an element of political choice  of fateful decisions taken at stages of drastic transition in history. Having established the necessary basis for its statehood and foreign policy  Belarus today may be said metaphorically to be standing at a crossroads of history. The problem of choice  of orientation  is particularly consonant with the present transitional stage of our life. Which way and how will Belarus move? What values will feed the roots of its State tree? What do the near and the distant future hold for our people  which has suffered so much? I think that hardly anyone would dare to give categorical and unambiguous answers today to these and many other complex questions. We can only make certain long-term assumptions and  so far as the prognosis is concerned  state a number of ideas and principles relating to several spheres of our activities. In the economic sphere  our point of reference is the Commonwealth of Independent States as a form of economic interaction.* Events have put to shame those sceptics who foretold the imminent and inevitable disintegration of the Commonwealth. Today it may indeed still remind us of a weak child  but a child who  in our opinion  is destined to stand firmly on his own feet. The Commonwealth whatever its membership may be will endure and stand because under present conditions it is a form of mutual economic survival. It is a form that has been forced on us but an inevitable one  without which it would be difficult to count on the formation of an East European economic market. It should be understood that the structure which is now being established by its members cannot instantly become the model of a developed  contemporary market. For 10 to 15 years we shall continue to stumble along a bumpy road  but gradually we shall move towards a state of market civilization which will ultimately enable us to raise seriously the question of integration into the European Community - the Common Market. We are convinced that for a relatively long time to come there will be two economic formations in Europe the European Community and what we might term the emerging East European economic community which will develop parallel to each other and gradually move closer together. For Belarus it is not so much a civilized form of economic divorce as an opportunity for creating a new quality of life  for getting ready  together with the other States of the Commonwealth  to become part of an all-European market. In other words  for us and  we hope  for a number of other States  the Commonwealth represents not isolation and economic autarky but rather a form of development  an inner transformation  whose fundamental essence and final goal is a new Europe. The idea of a common home for Europeans will become a reality only when the levels of economic development are equalized. At present we are still struggling to prevent our economic potential from declining too far. The specific characteristic of Belarus' approach to the reforms is that the dynamics of the establishment of the new market structures should and does fully match the fading away of the old economic structures. Such a harmonious approach enables us to avoid extremes: on the one hand  rushing forward without good reason and  on the other  rigidly clinging to what is outmoded. We are convinced that  having overcome its difficulties  the people of Belarus will realize its age-old dream  in the words of Yanka Kupala  ""to become the equal of other peoples in glory and power"". In the political sphere we shall continue to act in strict conformity with the constitutional principles of a neutral and non-nuclear State. We perceive each of these not as a ""given""  not as a ""moment of truth""  but as a goal born in the depths of our national consciousness as we lived our tragic history. We view the movement towards neutrality and non-nuclear status as a process of consolidating the independence and sovereignty of Belarus  acquiring our own political identity and breaking free of the traps that could in the future prevent our free and conscious integration into the structures objectively necessitated by world development. We realize clearly that the notion of classical neutrality is undergoing a radical change of content. Perpetual neutrality does not and cannot exist in a Europe and a world which are interdependent  just as no perpetual-motion machine exists or can exist in nature. The steps recently taken by European countries that had been neutral on the basis of tradition or treaties are evidence of this. We  the people of Belarus  on the basis of our tragic past  have been and continue to have a romantic concept of neutrality. This has become simply a matter of national instinct. There have been so many attempts to annihilate us  so many attacks upon us  that we still have the feeling that if we become neutral  our security will be guaranteed. But Belarus can become truly neutral only when the new Europe is free of blocs  when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ceases to exist just as the Warsaw Pact did in the recent past  when the freedom of movement of ideas  people  capital  goods and services becomes an everyday reality. The third trend is democratic institutionalization. There is no doubt that our main hopes in this area are associated with the adoption of a new Constitution which will make the process of democratization irreversible. I believe that this may happen in the coming months in the course of the second reading of our draft Constitution  which is scheduled for October of this year. The draft Constitution includes the following fundamental values and principles: deideologization and political pluralism; primacy of the norms of international law; the separation of legislative  executive and judicial power  with reciprocal checks and balances between the three branches of State organization; the introduction of norms for direct action with respect to human rights  any potential violation of which would automatically cause the judicial bodies to intervene; the undertaking of a thorough and complex judicial reform aimed at reforming the civil code and the code of civil procedure  the code of labour law  the criminal code and the code of criminal procedure  and the establishment of trial by jury; the creation of a constitutional court; and strict observance of the rights of national minorities on the basis of the recommendations of the 1990 Copenhagen meeting of CSCE on the human dimension and the 1991 Charter of Paris. In this area  in keeping with our traditional principles of tolerance in all spheres  including the religious sphere  we intend to continue to maintain a high standard even under the conditions of a turbulent Europe. We take pride in the fact that all through the many centuries of our history  despite the Pale of Settlement  we have never had such extreme chauvinistic phenomena as anti-Jewish pogroms or any other similar actions on our national soil. Our firm principles - a genuine love of peace  respect for others  tolerance  honouring the right of each ethnic group  regardless of its size  to have its own national identity and equal civil rights - will be preserved and augmented by us in contemporary Europe. This is demonstrated by the present-day situation in a multi-denominational Belarus  where a religious minority  the Catholics of Belarus  has been granted the right to celebrate its main religious holidays as officially established non-working days. If I am not mistaken  this is one of a very few such examples in Europe. It is our hope that the unique interfaith balance that has historically developed in Belarus will be valued and respected by all and will not become the subject of external manipulations. We in Belarus do not equate the religious denomination of the citizens of Belarus with the ethnic groups to which they belong. To say that we are living in an extraordinary time is nowadays often merely to mouth a cliche. The time has come  however  to go both beyond mere declarations that changes have taken place and beyond simple-minded sentimentality at the sudden disappearance of earlier global tensions. It is true that the disintegration of the totalitarian system  both as a social and political system and as a system of States  has led to the actual disappearance of the central line of tension between the two opposing global military and ideological groups. One pattern of international relations  which characterized most of the twentieth century  is being or has been replaced by another. But this still does not automatically mean the absence of conflicts. Paradoxically  the new pattern is reminiscent of the one that was laid down by the Vienna Congress and characterized the Europe of the nineteenth century  especially its latter half  with its multitude of centres of power and the abundance of inter-State and intra-State conflicts  often ethnic in content. No doubt the analogy is not exact  but its points of resemblance give cause for concern  a concern actively reinforced by the bloody conflicts in Yugoslavia  Nagorny Karabakh  Georgia and Moldova  all of which seemed inconceivable to Europe just a few years ago. And after all  we all recall the catastrophic convulsions with which that international structure ended at the beginning of the twentieth century. The political structure adopted thereafter was that of post-Versailles Europe  which also proved counterproductive. The creation of subregional groupings  such as the Little Entente  and an amorphous system of pseudo-collective security eventually demonstrated the complete inability of the League of Nations to function and failed to save the world from the conflagration of the Second World War. The situation today is similar in many respects. It is thought that unless urgent measures are taken  Europe will totally fail to approach complete prosperity and tranquillity. Internal tensions on the continent are increasing. A broader interpretation of CSCE is drawing it into new crises in the European-Asian area and making it more difficult to achieve any concrete results at the initial stage of emerging conflicts. Is it possible that we have not learned anything from the sad experiences of the past? It is true that the nuclear threat is receding  but the number of victims of conventional-arms conflicts is nevertheless terrifying. I am far from being a prophet of doom. Moreover  achieving our common strategic goal - the creation of a unified European home is a thoroughly realistic and attainable one. But we must not forget that the complications we face on the path I have just outlined are also real. We must see them clearly and overcome them in order to move forward through joint efforts towards our chosen goal. The main advantages of the new world order over that of the last century  in our view  lie in mankind's accumulated bitter experience  which we must prevent from recurring  and in the existence of a functioning and universally respected Organization of States whose task it is to ensure international peace and security. It is important  however  to enable the United Nations  through our joint efforts  to play an active  practical role in preventing conflicts and ""extinguishing"" those that nevertheless arise. At the present time it is both necessary and possible to strengthen the role of the United Nations in monitoring the compliance of States with their commitments under existing international covenants and conventions in the sphere of human rights. The issue of radically strengthening the role of the United Nations in this respect may become one of the items on the agenda of the World Conference on Human Rights  to be held at Vienna next year. It is essential to prevent the world from being split into groups on the basis of different degrees of well-being. Closed ""oases of prosperity"" cannot exist forever; they make the world unstable. Today  as never before  it is necessary to mount a multifaceted attack on world-wide economic problems. The removal of the threat of nuclear war and the growing burdens technology imposes on the global environment  which have reached and even exceeded the limit  have made clear the gravity of the problems that beset the environment. In this sphere too  the international community must choose not confrontation but cooperation in order to preserve the Earth's ecosystem. Without idealizing the results of the Rio de Janeiro Conference  Belarus shares the view that this is only the beginning of a long and difficult road. Here  in addition to everything else  it should be borne in mind that on the moral scale of values  the modest offerings of the poor are often much more precious than the donations of the rich. Belarus supports the idea of convening in 1995 the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations - a special session of the General Assembly during which another summit meeting in the interests of the Earth would be held  for the first comprehensive review of the implementation of ""Agenda 21""  the agenda for the twenty-first century  and at which the Earth-95 Charter  which may be developed on the basis of the 1992 Rio Declaration  would be discussed. We regard the unique summit meeting of the United Nations Security Council  held on 31 January of this year  as a milestone in preparing the United Nations for its role  which is totally new in its effectiveness. We highly commend the Secretary-General's report ""An Agenda for Peace""  and we are prepared to take part actively and as constructively as possible in discussing the recommendations put forward in that report. I can  however  declare even today our favourable attitude towards enhancing the activities of the United Nations in carrying out peace-keeping operations and  in general  in settling conflicts  many of which stem from inter-ethnic disputes. In particular  we are prepared to participate actively in the search for peaceful ways to resolve the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. We have agreed to hold an international conference at Minsk on this issue  and despite all our economic difficulties  we have done everything possible to enable it to begin its work. On the whole  Belarus' reserves of stability  both internally and on our borders  its traditions of cultural and national tolerance  its aspirations to the strict observance of human rights and its geopolitical position give it  in our opinion  the potential to play an active role as a peace-keeping mediator or coordinator in a number of situations  particularly in regions of the former USSR but also in a broader context. We are ready to make use of that potential in the interests of peace  cooperation and genuine respect for human rights. As we see it  the realization of this potential will be helped by another dimension in Belarus' foreign policy: our aspiration to balanced consistency  constructiveness and predictability of action. Speaking from this rostrum as the representative of a country that was stricken by the worst nuclear accident in human history and of a State going through an extremely difficult stage in its transition from one type of economy to another  I must express today our anxiety concerning two aspects of the General Assembly's activities. The Republic of Belarus is troubled by the delay in the implementation of the General Assembly resolution on strengthening international cooperation and coordinating efforts to study  mitigate and minimize the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster - or  to be more precise  by the Assembly's almost total inactivity with regard to implementing that resolution. The ineffectiveness of the United Nations  about which much has already been said from this rostrum  can be vividly illustrated inter alia by this example  which is particularly close and painful to us. We have learned from our own experience that resolutions in this particular case resolution 45/190  which was adopted by consensus and  I should point out  sponsored by 129 States - may be adopted  but the results of such seemingly active measures are minimal. The years that have elapsed since the disaster convince us that today we are essentially at the mercy of a capricious fate and must rely first of all on our own capabilities  on people of goodwill and on various international charitable and religious organizations  to which we are immeasurably grateful for their moral support and their assistance. Even the small secretariat that was established to oversee the implementation of that resolution is silently watching events from far-away Vienna  clearly not intending to relocate to one of the three capitals of the affected countries  closer to the scene. Apparently this is a much simpler and calmer way of proceeding. And what good would it do to try to take the Chernobyl issue outside of the United Nations  the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council? It is evident that policy relating to Chernobyl is becoming hostage to the current weaknesses and the inherent characteristics of the United Nations. Need we explain why  in the light of this situation  the prestige of such a universal Organization as the United Nations may be waning in the minds of many people in Belarus? A number of United Nations administrative and budgetary policies also need to be seriously revised. First and foremost  the scale of assessments of the States Members of the United Nations deserves criticism. Regrettably  in the course of its recent work the Committee on Contributions recommended to the General Assembly that the share contributed by the Republic of Belarus to the United Nations budget should be sharply and substantially increased. The state of our economy  especially during the transitional period  gives no grounds for such an increase. We wish to declare our profound disagreement with such an unjustified approach  and we insist that the amount of our Republic's contribution to the Organization's budget should be reconsidered. Furthermore  we are prepared to assume financial obligations  but  first and foremost  we are prepared to do so only in respect of financial obligations as from the time of the juridical disappearance of the USSR  that is to say  from December 1991. The poetic metaphor of a crossroads  which is so dominant for Belarus today  involves another important symbolic feature  that of departing and leaving something behind. As it passes through the present difficult crossroads  Belarus leaves behind forever the obsolete ballast of implausible stereotypes that were imposed upon us  bound us hand and foot and prevented us from being free and happy. We look forward with confidence to the new horizons now opening  we are ready to work indefatigably for our homeland  to make the life of the people of Belarus prosperous and secure  and we shall continue to make our contribution to the world community's constructive efforts. We are making our choice. We have made it already. "
"21",863,"BLZ",47,1992,"On behalf of the Government and people of Belize I extend congratulations to Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria on his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that he will steer the Assembly with wisdom and energy. My delegation also pays special tribute to the Secretary-General for his untiring efforts in bringing us closer to peace. Five hundred years ago the Colombus enterprise set off a chain of events that created the world we know today. Some may find in this anniversary cause for celebration  but the peoples of the Americas  of Africa and of Asia mourn the ruthless exploitation of nature and humanity that was unleashed by those events. The enterprise brought Christianity to the Western Hemisphere. It led to the creation of one world. It took humanity inexorably along the path to economic globalization and interdependence in all spheres. It also led to the creation of many dual worlds: in our Hemisphere  the European world and the indigenous world  the white world and the black world; the rich and the poor; the dominators and the dominated. And on our planet this tragic dichotomy is writ large in the great divide between North and South. The sermon of the Catholic Friar Antonio de Montesinos delivered in 1511 was and remains a telling message to the world. ""Tell me "" he said  ""what right have you to enslave them? What authority did you use to make war against them who lived at peace on their territories  killing them cruelly with methods never heard of? How can you oppress them and not care to feed or cure them  and work them to death to satisfy your greed?"" We are not here to lament tragic occurrences of a distant past  but to record the facts of an unacceptable present reality  for the world order whose foundations were laid then continues to this day. At this historic juncture of world history  we are called upon to create a new world order  an order based on justice and respect  an order that can produce peace. We should be in a better position than ever before to launch a united struggle to achieve this goal. We have seen the consequences of injustice and intolerance  and we are waking up to the obvious that we live on one planet  and that the welfare of one is inextricably linked to the welfare of all. Just a few days ago the people of Belize celebrated the eleventh anniversary of independence. On that occasion the Financial Times of London wrote about Belize as an oasis of calm with a promising future: ""Its judicial  political and educational systems work reasonably well ... It is possible to be optimistic about tomorrow."" Our goal is to become more productive  more competitive and more adaptable to the changes that lie before us at the dawn of the unfolding century. But even as we celebrated  we reminded ourselves of the need for fundamental changes in the present world order if people around the world are to achieve their expectations for a better quality of life. And so we feel compelled to add our modest voice to the rest of humanity's and propose the outlines of policies that will give us all a chance to pursue and maintain sustainable development and social equity. With the Assembly's indulgence  I will say a few words about three critical and interrelated blocks we believe must be used to build a new world order: justice  respect and peace. Justice for all. Five hundred years after  it cannot be right that 200 million people in our Hemisphere are living in critical poverty. This cannot be right because  among other things  our region  Latin America and the Caribbean  is rich. With 8 per cent of the world's population  that region possesses 23 per cent of the world's potentially arable land  46 per cent of the tropical forest  and 31 per cent of the available surface water. Nor is it that we have not been producing wealth. Since 1982 Latin America and the Caribbean have been transferring a net US$20 billion to US$30 billion every year to the industrial world. The poor are subsidizing the rich. The external debt of our region has not been reduced but has escalated alarmingly  from US$285 billion in 1981 to US$500 billion today. At the same time  the application of structural adjustment policies has enormously increased the social debt in so many countries of the region since the burdens of payment have fallen disproportionately on the poor  their plight worsened by sharp cuts in social programmes and public services. Cancellation or reduction of the debt of underdeveloped countries would be an act of justice. It would be a first step in the process of constructing a new world order that will enable sustainable development to take place based on a new socio-economic strategy that puts people first. We wish to emphasize that to achieve sustainable development we must build a new international order based on principles different from those that now govern international relations. We must reach agreement on a common strategy that respects the principles of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the right of each country to select its own path to development. In this day and age there is no place for the unilateral use of force and for claims made by States to exercise extra-territorial rights. The new international order must ensure for countries of the South adequate access to compatible technology  respect for the principle of gradualism for free and fair trade  just and stable prices for our products  food security  an end to the North's practices of protectionism and non-tariff barriers  adequate financial flows and the provision of investment funds that produce mutually beneficial results. There is now a growing international recognition of the universal validity of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We welcome this growing trend towards democratization in our region and in the world. We deem it necessary to echo the words of the Jakarta Message of the Tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement: no country should use its power to dictate its concept of democracy and human rights or to impose conditionalities on others. Human rights must be addressed on the basis of universality  individuality  impartiality and non-selectivity. The situation in South Africa today  while mitigated by glimmers of hope  still presents a picture of daily massive abuse of human rights of black people. Apartheid  by whatever name  is still firmly in place. We cannot be complacent about the one-step-forwards  two-steps-backwards syndrome that has apparently settled on the politics of that suffering country. The international community must help the South African people to defend the advances made so far and to advance the negotiations rapidly so that the people of South Africa may soon be able to start building a truly democratic State  free of the blights of racism  repression and exploitation. The people of Palestine  those in the territory and those scattered in the cruel diaspora  cry out for immediate and effective action to allow them to exercise their rights to their territory  to self-determination and peace. The institutionalized denial of the rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories continues unabated - starting with the right to life and passing through all categories of rights. How can we allow such denial and abuse to continue on the threshold of the twenty-first century? My delegation earnestly calls on all parties involved rapidly to conclude negotiations for a just solution to the Palestinian question and on this body to do everything possible to facilitate the process  beginning with the effective enforcement of all relevant United Nations resolutions. In the Arabian Gulf region  as in other regions  we must be alert to any violations of the principle of territorial integrity. We cannot condone the acquisition by force of an island  no matter how small  or of any territory. In our hemisphere the people of Haiti continue to suffer gross violations of human rights under a military dictatorship that deprives them of the first fruit of their decades-long struggle for democracy. We in the Caribbean feel a special concern for - indeed a special debt towards the people of Haiti. As our Caribbean novelist George Lamming said recently: ""The first and most decisive blow struck at the Plantation  destroying its hegemony  was the triumph of the Haitian war of independence."" Yet today the democratic triumph of the Haitian people is frustrated as President Aristide remains in exile. As a Caribbean country we cannot remain silent in the face of this injustice. Neither can we condone the systematic strangulation of another Caribbean nation in violation of all norms of international law. Justice must be for all. It cannot be selectively dispensed. Perhaps the greatest contribution to world peace and development made by modern environmentalists has been to remind us of what our ancestors instinctively knew: that we cannot use the Earth's resources for our own benefit  but that if we wish to survive we have to respect the Earth in all its diversity. Since that fateful landing 500 years ago  the assault on nature in our hemisphere has resulted in an ecological destruction unprecedented in world history. Countless numbers of plant and animal species have been permanently lost to humanity. The real tragedy  however  is that in this supposedly enlightened age the destruction continues. We are destroying the planet by conscious acts of devastation  and the double tragedy for us in the South is that even when these acts take place within our jurisdictions we are rarely the authors and hardly ever the beneficiaries of their short-term gains. While we accept the responsibility for conserving our common environment  we cannot unilaterally close off options for development to our people when their need is so great. What is needed is effective international cooperation that  recognizing our interdependence  compensates us for our efforts. We in Belize are taking this responsibility seriously. We have set aside more than a quarter of the country's land mass as environmentally protected areas; we have resisted the seductions of mass tourism and opted for sustainable eco-tourism. We are about to pass a comprehensive environment protection law. We are also struggling to come to terms with the demands of maintaining biodiversity. The regional report  ""Our Own Agenda""  reminds us that ""diversity of life forms is indispensable for the survival of the biosphere and the human species. Biodiversity is acknowledged today as a common value  and its conservation is of a high priority for all"". We also believe  however  that we the world community will never succeed in respecting and preserving biodiversity if we do not respect and preserve homodiversity. Our biggest incentive to preserve the environment is to preserve the human species and enhance its prospects for sustainable development. While it is true that we are all Earth's children  we are also enriched by differences. We are one people with many cultures  many languages  many distinct ways of life  many different creeds. We are one tapestry  but with many different threads. We must respect these differences  or there will never be peace. The phenomenal growth in migration all over the world should convince even the most sceptical that it is in everyone's interest to learn to respect the diversity of peoples. This phenomenon  while creating tensions in the short term  will  we believe  enhance the probability of all of us learning to live with people whose cultures are in many ways different from our own. Either that  or we condemn ourselves and our children to perpetual strife. When we struggle together for justice for all and we learn to respect nature and humanity  we give ourselves the opportunity of creating a world in peace. But we cannot talk about creating a peaceful world unless we first acknowledge that the world is not in peace and identify the major causes of this situation. We consider it more important to prevent conflicts than to separate combatants after conflict has broken out. One cannot speak about keeping the peace when there is no peace to be kept. We believe  therefore  that the United Nations should concentrate much more on a new  expanded role of peace-building. However  we can work effectively together only if the structures we use to define and implement our common strategy are based on the very principles we proclaim. We cannot espouse democracy in our various countries while our own collective Organization is not only profoundly undemocratic but based on a world power relationship that is no longer valid. There is an urgent need to reform the United Nations system. In particular  the Security Council must be democratized. As His Excellency Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  states in his report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  ""regional action as a matter of decentralization  delegation and cooperation with the United Nations efforts could not only lighten the burden of the Council but also contribute to a deeper sense of participation  consensus and democratization in international affairs"". (A/47/277  para. 64) In our hemisphere we support moves to strengthen the Organization of American States and its related institutions and join the efforts to make them more effective mechanisms for addressing our common concerns. Closer to home  we are committed to an expanded Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  as recommended by the West Indian Commission in its report entitled ""Time for Action"". The Commission recommended that CARICOM initiate proposals for the establishment of an Association of Caribbean States directed to both economic integration and functional cooperation  with membership open to all CARICOM member States  the other island States of the Caribbean and the Latin American countries of the Caribbean littoral. The Commission's recommendations are being carefully studied  but we can say that the concept of an expanded Caribbean Community has always been on Belize's agenda  not least because we are both a Caribbean and a Central American country  and we feel called upon to provide one of the vital links between the two subregions. The task of bringing them closer together is made easier by Guatemala's recognition of Belize as an independent sovereign State  and we are confident that with goodwill on both sides there will be a satisfactory resolution of Guatemala's territorial claim  which is still outstanding. Another important principle that our Organization is pledged to respect is that of universality. This session is enriched by the presence of 20 new Members  and we must support the call for a return of the Republic of China to the international community. We cannot continue to ignore the reality of 20 million people organized in a State  and we are confident that those people are capable of making a useful contribution to our work at the United Nations. We all rejoice at the end of the cold war. We can all breathe easier now that the threat of a nuclear holocaust has been reduced. But while none of us died as a result of the cold war  during all those years millions died from poverty  and hundreds of millions suffered hunger  malnutrition  lack of education  poor housing and the indignity of unemployment. The tragedy is that the system continues to take its toll. Now that the cold war is ended  are we not entitled to expect something more than triumphalist declarations of this fact? It is unforgivable that  while military budgets remain so largely disproportionate to any rational security need  children are dying from hunger or preventable disease. If  over the next five years. Governments in our hemisphere alone were to reduce their military budgets to a level 20 per cent below 1990 figures  a minimum of $50 billion would be available at the end of that period for the war on poverty. Let us not forget that poverty and misery have principally affected women and young people; they have borne the brunt of the hardships produced by structural adjustment policies. We must make a firm commitment to implement a gender perspective aimed at the integration and mobilization of women as full participants in  and beneficiaries of  the development process. At the same time  we must take special measures to provide young people with the education and employment that will allow them to lead healthy and productive lives. In this context  we cannot but agonize at the terrible toll that drug abuse and drug trafficking are taking on our young people. We must redouble our efforts in the fight against these evils. Adequate resources must be mobilized internationally and made available for the interdiction and eradication of drugs  as well as for treatment and rehabilitation. We harbour no illusions about the enormity of our task or about the chances of our succeeding in creating a just and peaceful world. But  no matter what the odds  we must make a solemn commitment to give it our best shot. We owe it to the millions who have gone before us and who have struggled against injustice and poverty. We owe it to the suffering peoples of our time. Above all  we owe it to the children who will inherit the world we make for them. We must all reaffirm our commitment to full and effective implementation of the Declaration and the Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children. It is for the children that we must construct a world system that will guarantee the quality of life necessary to ensure their well-being. The challenge is there for us. All we can do is begin the task; the children must pursue it. We must begin now if the children are to have any chance at all. We must do so with a sense of urgency. Time is running out. This is the moment to act with God's help and the support of peoples represented here at the United Nations. "
"22",910,"BOL",47,1992,"I first had the honour of addressing the General Assembly in September 1989  shortly after assuming the presidency of Bolivia. I anticipated then that the vertiginous changes taking place in and around us would bear the hallmark of what I termed the revolution of democracy. Today  after all we have experienced in this brief but intense period  we can see more clearly that the growth of universal awareness among men and women has not only given democracy  as a system  a global dimension for the first time in the history of mankind  but has also meant that its power for change and its potential for transformation are clearly challenging old ideas  old structures and old habits. I will say without fear of contradiction if I may be permitted to paraphrase what someone has said that democracy is racing round the globe  no longer a phantasmal newcomer but rather a wind of renewal and hope. Accordingly  what we must now surely call global democracy is shedding new light on old truths  leading us to understand better  for example  that power is  by definition  something to be shared; that we need a new and better understanding of the dynamics of consensus and dissent; and that the various forms of intermediation necessary for social life are now in crisis. Indeed  the more complex the organizational processes of a particular government  as is the case in democracy  the greater the need for that power to be shared if we wish to see it adequately maintained and developed. By the same token  the more rudimentary and simple power is  as is the case in authoritarianism and dictatorship  the less evident is the necessity of sharing power. Similarly  we can now see that the useful consensus on the basis of which the old democracies of the industrialized countries were built  with government and opposition thinking and acting virtually in the same way  seems to citizens a worn-out mechanism that hampers change. Paradoxically  at the opposite pole  in the young democracies of developing countries  the citizenry zealously calls for consensus as an essential means of uniting the nation's forces in pursuit of indispensable changes. It would seem  then  that where the art of consensus was perfected  the need is arising to learn how to manage dissent in an appropriate way; and where dissent had become a way of life and a cause of stagnation  there is a need in turn to learn how to build consensus. This could well be described as the dynamics of consensus and dissent under democracy. As to the forms of intermediation to be found in social life  we also see that the citizens of universal democracy are striving to reduce intermediacy  striving to take the initiative in everyday life in a more direct way. It is then that the citizen comes to regard intermediation as something of his own that is inescapable  genuine  close  efficient  transparent and representative. Therefore  we should not be surprised today to find a state of crisis in the political  religious  trade-union and cultural forms of intermediation  and even in that great intermediator  the State itself. This last point is especially useful and relevant as we turn to an examination of the present state of our Organization  for  in our view  what has come to be called the crisis of the United Nations seems to be in essence nothing other than a crisis of intermediation. I say this because in fact we have always thought that the United Nations represents the most advanced mechanism of intermediation on Earth but that  in order to continue to be such  it must adapt itself to the newly emerging global scenarios of the revolution of democracy. For nearly half a century after its inception  the United Nations played the privileged role of intermediary during the era of hegemonic blocs and the cold war. That indicated the quantity and quality of intermediation possible within that context  at the same time creating a way of sharing international power and a method of managing the dynamics of consensus and dissent  within the prevailing balance  managing in that context to determine even its own structure  organization and functioning. Under that old order  the United Nations achieved great credibility. And although in many places peace was not always preserved  the Organization achieved something that appeared impossible: prevention of a nuclear conflagration between opposing and seemingly irreconcilable blocs. But things have changed dramatically and  with them  so must our Organization. In saying this I believe I am voicing what all of us in the Assembly are thinking. It is clear that the new world order needs new credibility  which the United Nations must earn. The citizens and nations of global democracy are placing unavoidable challenges before our Organization  challenges that require us to adapt its structures  modernize its machinery and identify new priorities and thus the new intermediation that is possible in terms of quantity and quality. And  with no other aim in mind than that of seeking answers  allow me to illustrate these ideas by describing a few selected developments which  in addition to being new  have the common feature of having gained global proportions  which makes them particularly deserving of the Organization's keenest attention. The first of these is what I would describe as the dialectic of the universal and the particular  or  alternatively  the dialectic of universalisms and particularisms. I am referring to the obvious fact that peoples today are expressing two attitudes that are seemingly contradictory but are none the less part of the same dynamic. On the one hand they are striving for complementarity through processes of integration that are laying out ever broader geographical  political  economic and commercial areas that already constitute a new world geography. On the other hand  simultaneously and paradoxically  those same peoples and citizens are reaffirming their identity and their essence  sometimes intransigently demanding their own cultural  historic  religious  and immediate political frameworks. In an apparent contradiction  they seem to be trying to experience  simultaneously and complementarily  the great and the small  the longer-term and the immediate  the universal and the particular. The second of these developments arises from the fact that the market economy has gained ascendancy in the same manner as democracy and  together with them  the awareness of a better life and the need for well-being and human and social development have also become global. Consequently  we face as never before the urgent need for a form of solidarity that will enable us to hit upon an appropriate relationship between the market economy  democracy  and human development. That solidarity  by emphasizing social development and  for many of our countries  in a frontal assault upon poverty  will enable us also to redefine the foundations of new social legitimacy for States  internally and internationally. The third development has to do with something that we agreed upon at the recent Conference in Rio de Janeiro. We live in a single global ecosystem and we are all jointly responsible for its conservation and clean-up. We also agreed that little purpose would be served by preserving a world to be inhabited by an impoverished human race  which clearly implies that the ecological stewardship of the planet does not run counter to our peoples' needs for development. Consequently  it remains for us promptly to endow the Commission on Sustainable Development with the resources  powers and machinery it will need to fulfil the objectives we have set for ourselves. That means implementing Agenda 21  a true plan of action for the next century  as a point of departure for offsetting the historical environmental debt we have spoken of in other forums. The fourth development pertains to technology. In the joint deliberations the Presidents of the Ibero-American countries engaged in to mark the Quincentennial of 1492  we concluded that the final explanation for all colonial processes is to be found in a confrontation in which the winner achieves ascendancy by virtue of his technological superiority  and that this first technological defeat lies at the root of dependency and marginalization. We then agreed that in order to redress that situation it was necessary to share technological power more democratically  and that one appropriate way to do so might well be to declare as the common heritage of mankind those basic technologies that are indispensable to satisfy adequately the equally basic rights of mankind: health  nutrition  education and housing. I venture to reiterate that initiative before the Assembly with an explicit proposal by Bolivia to the international community that we should seek participatory  creative and markedly personal machinery that would become the main thrust of the work of the social summit we should now convene. The fifth  and last  development I wish to bring to the attention of the Assembly relates to a right which is already recognized under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of our Organization  which states that everyone has the right to ""seek  receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers."" (resolution 217 (III). Article 19) Representatives will surely agree that in recent decades technology has turned information  too  into a phenomenon of equally global proportions. At the same time  the universal revolution of democracy has instilled an unprecedented awareness among citizens of their right to inform and be informed. That growing awareness is in turn linked to the observable fact that the gap now separating the well-informed citizen from the poorly informed citizen seems quantitatively and qualitatively greater  or at least equal to  that other gap separating extremes of wealth and poverty. All of this leads us  in modern terms  to the perception that information has become the Gordian knot or  if you wish  the crossroads of human rights. Indeed  although it may appear an arbitrary simplification  the better-informed citizen eats more and better than the citizen who is not well-informed and has greater opportunities  among other things  to obtain access to better health and education. The problem becomes all the more acute when  as mentioned earlier  information today has become a phenomenon that is increasingly dependent on advanced technology and  consequently  the exercise of the right conferred by the aforementioned Article 19 of the Declaration really depends on each citizen's greater or lesser opportunity to have access to technology on an equal footing. I believe that a matter of such great importance requires special treatment and attention on the part of our Organization. With that in mind  it seems most appropriate to suggest that serious and urgent consideration be given to the inclusion as a central focus of the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 the topic of citizens' information. I say ""citizens'"" information because I am not referring to that other matter  relating more to information among nations  which came to be known as the ""new international information order"". Rather  I am referring to the citizens' right to information and to the urgent need to guarantee  in principle and in reality  equality for mankind with regard to information. I wish to share with the Assembly my impression that  if we keep up with history in moving along this road  we will be arming mankind against what might be the most serious threat to democracy: the new authoritarianism  or  if you prefer  the great dictatorship of the twenty-first century - the perverse  systematic  sophisticated  invisible and elusive subjugation of the citizens to the distorted and monopolistic control of information technology. Allow me now to devote a few moments of my statement to recent developments in my country. The curtain has just fallen on a period which is now gone  perhaps never to return. In my country  the signs of new times are much more visible than in other regions. Members here have themselves often expressed that judgment and often urged and encouraged the efforts of my people  who may now take pride in achievements that have impressed sceptics and enlightened those whose minds were weighed down by the weary logic of the past. Bolivia is a nation at peace  and  collectively and individually  it is perhaps one of the safest on the continent. It has consolidated its democratic system and is making concordance the basic instrument of its political endeavours. On 9 July  all my country's political parties Government and opposition  right and left made a solemn commitment to carry forward in the coming months the basic tasks of modernizing the State and society through judicial  electoral and educational reforms  reforms in the administrative and political machinery and  finally  reforms in the Constitution itself. How encouraging it is to have left behind the Bolivia of factionalism  one of the nightmares of the twentieth century  and to be entering the twenty-first century free of those shackles. We have built  first  financial stability and  then  growth. To do this  it was necessary to face squarely the need to carry out the in-depth reform and modernization of the economic system. That reform stands on four foundations: stimulating competitiveness in the economy and freeing it from tariff barriers  subsidies and State protection; expanding the scope for private initiative in order to achieve the broadest citizen participation in economic growth; stimulating investment  generating employment and extending the benefits of development to the majority of Bolivians; and transforming the State into an efficient manager respectful of solidarity  and into the main party responsible for infrastructure and human development. In this way  and based on the wisdom and capabilities of its people  Bolivia has achieved the lowest rates of inflation in South America in the last three years. At the same time  its growth rate was one of the highest in the region  and per capita income has grown systematically during my Administration. All of this has brought us to a time of happiness and harmony. For the first time in my country's contemporary history  there are more Bolivians coming back than leaving  and more money flowing in than flowing out of Bolivia. Never before has so much been invested in health  education and basic sanitation  simply because we have never had as much access as we have today to concessional resources  which are coming to Bolivia thanks to the international community's confidence in the responsible way in which my country is being governed. We are building an optimistic Bolivia  a Bolivia with a future and with international stature. While Bolivia is a country which reaches the Atlantic through the major watercourses of the Amazon and the Rio de la Plata  it is by history  geography and culture a country of the Pacific Ocean. There is no better place than this forum of peace for me to reiterate that an unjust war deprived us of the status of a maritime nation  in which our life as a republic began  and thereby turned Bolivia into a country without a seacoast. The Bolivian people will never give up its aspiration to the sea and to a sovereign and useful presence on the Pacific coast. It matters not how much effort and sacrifice may be required in pursuit of that objective. To this end  we have laid out a strategy of peace and integration  a gradual and pragmatic strategy by which an appropriate solution to Bolivia's landlocked situation can be found that could be generally and mutually beneficial to the countries of the region. Proof of the soundness and impact of that strategy is the outcome of the Mariscal de Santa Cruz agreements signed with Peru on 24 January in the southern city of Ilo. Although not encompassing the sovereignty to which we aspired  and although not in the location which historically is rightfully ours  agreement has been reached on a commercial and industrial duty-free zone and on administration of the port by Bolivian and Peruvian entrepreneurs. Moreover  a tourism area of 5 kilometres of beach has been granted  and it has already been named ""Boliviamar"". Three years ago I described to the Assembly Bolivia's national strategy to fight the production of  trafficking in and illicit consumption of narcotics  a strategy which my Government was then beginning to implement  asking the international community for its understanding and support. In 1989 there were reasons to fear that drug trafficking might irremediably corrode the political and institutional system of Bolivia  that it might come to dominate the economy as a whole and might lead  sooner or later  to escalating violence. Although at that time there were doubts as to Bolivia's ability to carry out the plan  today I can say categorically that cocaine traffic has ceased to be a strategic risk for Bolivia. Bolivia is proof that the struggle against drug trafficking not only is possible but can also be successful. Against the temptation to yield to discouragement and pessimism  Bolivia stands out as a symbol  as a banner of hope and optimism. We have systematically reduced the areas devoted to coca growing; we have reduced the production of paste and cocaine hydrochloride; we have taken firm action in the selection of specialized personnel  following criteria of efficiency and honesty; and we have broken up the main networks of drug trafficking in Bolivia by means of a decree-law known as the ""Repentance Decree""  as a result of which the leaders of these organizations are now in my country's jails. All this was possible because we managed to avoid the imposition from outside of concepts and plans ill-suited to our national reality. On the contrary  we forged ahead with a peaceful struggle  ruling out the militarization of the struggle and spared the country from the confrontation and violence which had occurred elsewhere. In the light of this unquestionably positive picture  Bolivia asks the international community to redouble its efforts to reduce consumption  to control chemical precursors and to increase quantitatively and qualitatively the resources allocated to improved functioning of alternative development mechanisms  Bolivia's substantive contribution to the body of knowledge on this topic. Above all  we ask most earnestly that the coca leaf not be confused with cocaine: the coca leaf is a good thing and is an expression of an age-old cultural tradition originating in the Andes; cocaine  by contrast  is foreign  alien  and came from outside. From this rostrum  I pay a tribute to all the Bolivians who made possible the enormous advances we have achieved in this fight against one of the cruelest and most pernicious forms of corruption in contemporary society. I wish to express my special thanks to the self-sacrificing workers and farmers of my country. Tomorrow  at the offices of the Interamerican Development Bank in Washington  intergovernmental meetings will begin with a view to defining the composition of the governing board of the Development Fund for Indigenous Peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean  created on the initiative of the Ibero-American countries meeting at the Guadalajara and Madrid summits. Bolivia  a country of original indigenous stock  like so many others of our continent  asks the international community to support this programme  which is vital for the lives of many men and women  especially as we prepare to celebrate 1993 as the International Year for the World's Indigenous People with the theme of ""Indigenous people a new partnership"". This is the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. But for the peoples of the Americas  and in particular the Ibero-American peoples  this session marks the quincentennial of 1492. It is therefore a psychological reality for us that one chapter of history is drawing to a close and another is opening  one in which mankind will continue its tireless search  discovering and building new worlds. That is why Bolivia  a peaceful country of the South  which is experiencing the profound challenges of development  is also concerned about the fate of the industrialized North  where  following the natural euphoria after the end of the cold war and the victory of democracy  there have been worrying signs of uncertainty  lack of confidence and pessimism. I say I am concerned about the North because  in contrast with the past  we are now all living in one global political ecosystem  where threats  risks  victories and failures have repercussions for us all. For its part  Bolivia is prepared  together with other countries  to run the shared risk of building a new and better world. In that endeavour  there is only one requirement: that no one ignore anyone else. "
"23",957,"BRA",47,1992,"Let me congratulate you. Sir  and the Republic of Bulgaria upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your experience as a respected political leader and jurist augurs well for the success of our deliberations. I wish to acknowledge the work of Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia and his inspired and constructive presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I present my compliments to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose election was supported by Brazil from the beginning. His experience and statesmanship  which I had the occasion to witness at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  will certainly stand him in good stead in the exercise of his high office. Brazil welcomes the representatives of the new States Members of the United Nations: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. My country wishes to explore the possibilities of cooperation with the new Member States. The opening of the general debate requires that we should call forth national and regional aspirations without losing sight of our concern for the universal. It requires that we should seek to fulfil our individual identities in a harmonious whole  that should we be both effective and just. Historical change should not be viewed as the chaotic workings of nature  which  like a storm  are beyond control. Nor does it bear comparison to a theatrical play whose plot and outcome are known to the author and the performers in advance but which the audience discovers only as the play unfolds. The most pertinent metaphor for understanding the lessons of history would be that of a labyrinth. Conceived of as a labyrinth  history unfolds unpredictably. This  however  does not deny the rational creativity of man and of peoples. Rational creativity lies in identifying by trial and error the blind alleys in the maze of collective experience  while trusting that there are exit points and struggling to reach them. Today the role of reason in the search for a way out lies in resorting to historical experience to promote those values which may ensure better and higher ways of life in an organized society: freedom  democracy  human rights  sustainable development  justice and peace. In times of change it is important to stop and think about the values and concepts that lie at the foundation of international relations. The process I have described gives rise both to hopes and to concerns. It reflects the interaction of centripetal forces that tend towards the universal and of centrifugal forces that call attention to diversity. On the one hand  societies are embracing standards and practices that are well on the way to becoming universal  as witnessed by the strengthening of democracy and human rights  of sustainable development and of free enterprise and market integration. On the other hand  we witness the rebirth of nationalism and ethnic strife  religious fervour taken to extremes and forms of discrimination which multiply tension and threaten world peace. The United Nations  and in particular the General Assembly  should serve as the natural point of convergence for the various trends that shape the complexity of our time. That complexity requires building a new international order based on the democratic participation of all States  as stressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization. In conformity with its commitment to dialogue and cooperation  Brazil wishes to make its contribution to the common task of ensuring the equitable fulfilment of the historical aspirations of mankind. Brazil takes pride in its diplomatic tradition. With 10 neighbours and nearly 17 000 kilometres of borders  all of which were peacefully negotiated  Brazil's destiny is civil and fruitful coexistence with all countries. The democracy we enjoy today at the domestic level is an assurance of unity and stability. It teaches us to accept the diversity and divergence inherent in a pluralistic society. It permits us to face crises and vicissitudes within the rule of law and the strict boundaries of constitutional order. At the same time  democracy encourages us to uphold its principles and methods in our relations with other nations. In a democracy the rules of the game relate to the sharing and limitation of power. Government must belong to the many  so that it can resist imposition by the few. Power must be constrained by law  so as to avoid the arbitrary discretion of those who wield it. The acknowledgement of these rules aims at the qualitative transformation of life in society the passage from the realm of violence to the realm of non-violence achievable by the taming of power through law. This is what confers on the law an irrevocable ethical content. In the realm of public international law  this ethical content finds its expression in the peaceful settlement of disputes  since its procedures for choosing among available options for action seek precisely to dispel the fears that derive from the rule of violence. It is in that spirit of democratic civility that Brazil intends to participate in the process of reorganizing the international system. The unprecedented historical crossroads at which we find ourselves calls for a new agenda  an agenda embodying an awareness of the present and a vision of the future. The drafting of this agenda must take into account all the dimensions of value. All values have to be susceptible of fulfilment and are inexhaustible. To subsist  they must be translated into normative and social reality. However  the fulfilment of values in history does not exhaust their content. For example  we can and may always obtain more freedom and more justice. The foreign policy of Brazil stresses these twin dimensions in its response to the new international situation and stresses them through a creative adaptation and vision of the future. These concepts  we think  are appropriate as we consider the items on the agenda of the General Assembly. The starting-point for a rethinking of the international system lies in the acknowledgement that peace  security and disarmament are inseparable. The suggestions put forward by Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali in his document ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) lend new contours and an enlarged scope to discussions on the role of the United Nations. All Member States should participate in an in-depth consideration of the provocative and creative suggestions put forward by the Secretary-General. Brazil will contribute actively to their consideration at the present session of the General Assembly. The ""Agenda for Peace"" comprises timely issues  such as preventive diplomacy  peace-making and post-conflict peace-building. Such innovative concepts are  by their very nature  still fluid. They open up new perspectives which remain to be explored  albeit cautiously  as befits an encounter between unknown realities and bold and imaginative ideas. The dream of a better world cannot  however  be excluded from the debate. Though realism is the starting-point of all political action  it should not be taken as its final objective. Justice is the ultimate value that should  in the final analysis  permeate the concept of order. Peace-building is a continuous task and an evolving process. In addition to the concepts related to the means of tackling conflict situations  we should also seek to define the logical corollary of preventive peace-building  namely the forestalling of crises deriving from economic and social factors. To that end  we must strengthen the role of the United Nations  not only in restoring peace and security  but also in fostering economic and social progress. Other elements should therefore be added to those put forward in the ""Agenda for Peace""  such as the promotion of a more just international economic environment  full respect for human rights and the rule of law  general and complete disarmament  and the democratization of international relations based on sovereign equality and the non-use of force. It is essential to avoid the temptation of a selective application of the provisions of the Charter. The instruments for the maintenance of international peace and security must not serve to consolidate imbalances based on power relations  which are not more legitimate because they are real. The fundamental attribute of legitimacy consists in the all-encompassing perspective of humanity. It is of paramount importance to uphold the provision of the Charter whereby the maintenance of international peace and security is the collective responsibility of all Member States. In carrying out its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  the Security Council acts on behalf of all Member States of the United Nations. Now that the Council is being called upon to play an increasingly decisive role  there is a clear need for an in-depth discussion of the representative nature of its composition  the scope of its competence and the powers of its members. We should consider  with prudence no less than with foresight  such readjustments as would permit the Council to discharge its functions in a more representative manner. Brazil is prepared to contribute constructively to this effort  taking fully into account the institutional balance among the organs of the United Nations provided for in the San Francisco Charter. The contribution of Brazil to United Nations peace-keeping operations reflects our commitment to implementing the principle of collective responsibility. The issue of disarmament has been momentarily overshadowed by that of security in the wake of the unstable situations which followed the collapse of global confrontation. The progressive reduction of arms stockpiles  especially of weapons of mass destruction  remains  however  fundamental. Much has indeed been accomplished in the field of disarmament  yet much remains to be done. Brazil and Argentina have jointly entered into an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency on the application of safeguards. With Argentina and Chile  we launched an initiative to ensure the full entry into force of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America the Treaty of Tlatelolco. The entry into force of the Treaty of Tlatelolco will make Latin America the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in the world. This represents a balanced agreement on non-proliferation with equality of rights and obligations. We have banned chemical and biological weapons from our territory through the Mendoza Agreement  which we concluded with our neighbouring States. We have thus advanced the application of the convention on chemical weapons  which sets down uniform rules of disarmament and verification binding on all signatories. We hope similarly universal and non-discriminatory disarmament conventions will be concluded in the future. Regarding the zone of peace and cooperation of the South Atlantic  we welcome the opportunity to work with our partners on both sides of the ocean in a process of dialogue and joint endeavour aimed in particular at the protection of the marine environment. Security and disarmament are only means to achieve the highest goal to which mankind truly aspires the goal of peace. Peace  not as the mere absence of war  but as an affirmative value  peace as a state of satisfaction in which relations among States can be ruled by law and disputes settled by peaceful means. Peace must be linked to cooperation  of which justice is an integral part  for common interests are rooted in a balanced relation among States. It is widely acknowledged that there is a close link between the democratic system of government and the inclination of States towards peace  and conversely  a link between authoritarian regimes and a greater propensity to conflict. The values inherent in democracy pluralism  majority rule  tolerance  consensus  the rule of law extend naturally to the external affairs of the State. The strengthening of democracy on a planetary scale represents therefore a decisive contribution to the building of a more peaceful international system. An unquestionable value in the domestic order  democracy also projects itself as an organizing principle of the international order  through the strengthening of multilateral diplomacy and the search for a broad participation in the international decision-making process. Brazil is convinced that relations among States must be governed predominantly by incentives to cooperation and not by disincentives. That amounts to promoting a positive and not a negative agenda for international relations  an agenda that must be negotiated in a democratic manner. The improvement of international cooperation to ensure adequate and effective treatment of world-wide issues  such as those of humanitarian  developmental or environmental character  is to bf: pursued within the basic principles of international law  foremost among which is respect for State sovereignty. Fortunately  a new perception has evolved in the field of human rights that focuses on the need for special protection for the most vulnerable groups in each country. Cultural  religious and ethnic minorities  women  children  refugees and immigrants are social groups frequently exposed to intolerance and to the abuse of their most basic rights. We must strive to bridge the gap between what is achievable and what is desirable. Respect for human rights must be universal in scope  just as the 1948 Declaration is universal and just as the provisions of the basic covenants and conventions on this matter are universal. In short  human rights must not be violated under any pretext whatsoever. The full enjoyment of individual rights requires material conditions of social and economic organization grounded in the idea of justice. The holding in 1993 of the World Conference on Human Rights  as well as the proposed world summit on social development  will provide opportunities to strengthen the protection and the promotion of human dignity. The Government of Brazil is doing everything in its power to protect and promote human rights. We maintain an open dialogue with international organizations governmental and non-governmental and we have acceded to the main legal instruments on this matter. To be assured of success in our endeavours  we further need constructive international cooperation to address better the perverse consequences of extreme poverty and to equip democratic States with conditions to reinforce their preventive and corrective actions in these areas  where serious violations of individual rights still occur. One of the most urgent tasks of the United Nations will be to promote in all countries a strong campaign against all forms of discrimination. It is high time we reaffirmed the classic concept of tolerance as an essential constituent element of life in an enlightened society. Equality can be genuine only when there is respect for diversity  where there is respect for heterogeneity. Policies of racial segregation  by any name  will always be hateful. The idea that a nation or a social group is somehow superior because it is ethnically homogeneous is flatly wrong. The world has not lived through the horrors of a world war  the anguish of 45 years of the cold war and the hardship of conflicts that have offended the conscience of mankind to witness now the resurgence of the spectre of xenophobia  of exclusive nationalism  or of ethnic  cultural or religious intolerance. We cannot allow the concept of nationhood to serve as a cloak for the practices of oppression. Brazil  as a multiracial country proud of its roots  rejects outright attitudes that are inimical to the human race. Just as our societies cannot coexist with the marginalization of parts of their population  so the new international society we seek to build cannot coexist with the marginalization of entire peoples. The interdependence of the world economy paradoxically highlights the shortcomings of global cooperation. The gap between the North and the South is widening before our eyes. This situation cannot persist. We must work together to foster economic growth in all countries. There will be no peace or security so long as such disparities continue to distort the international system. In an increasingly open and interdependent international community  the leverage from international trade is extraordinary. We must therefore prevent protectionist pressures linked to short-term parochial interests from undercutting the negotiating effort of the Uruguay Round  inspired by free competition and the multiplication of benefits. The difficulties and sluggishness inherent in the process of multilateral-trade liberalization should not prompt us to opt indiscriminately for self-contained regional blocks. We see  and would like others to see  regional-trade liberalization as a form of creating additional opportunities for international trade as a whole  without inflicting losses on third parties. This is how we view the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)  the regional basis for our competitive integration in the international economy. Brazil is a global trader. We trade with all regions of the world and we are modernizing our economy through trade liberalization and openness towards the world economy. Negotiations with foreign creditors have produced positive results. Science and technology today represent the crucial variable of economic success. Promoting their dissemination and ensuring greater transparency and equity in the access to knowledge is fundamental for development. That is the spirit that guides the Brazilian initiative now under consideration in the United Nations Disarmament Commission  aiming at the definition of non-discriminatory and universally acceptable principles to regulate international transfers of sensitive technologies for peaceful purposes. Last June Brazil hosted the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which was the largest diplomatic event in the history of the Organization and set new patterns of international understanding and cooperation. We worked creatively to face the challenges of the present and boldly in the preparations for the future. The Rio Conference was not aimed at simply reorganizing this or that aspect of economic activity or of life in society. It was aimed  rather  at reshaping the very notion of development  to conceive it on a more rational  more just and more generous foundation that of sustainable development. The Rio Declaration  Agenda 21  the Declaration on Forests  the climate Convention and the biodiversity Convention outline a legal framework and a political project of paramount importance for international cooperation. The significance of these instruments will be even more evident over time. Adherence to the principles that have been agreed upon and prompt ratification of the two Conventions will usher in a new era of international cooperation. The Rio Conference set up a new paradigm  a new social contract  on the basis of the fundamental concept of sustainable development. It established as a primary concern the need to ensure the most rational balance between legitimate development goals  on the one side  and the preservation of the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations  on the other. Sustainable development is the contemporary expression of progress. It is the basis for a new international environment and development order. In welcoming the Heads of State and Government who honoured us with their presence. President Fernando Collor stated that ""The world has decided to assemble here to address no more  no less than the life itself on the surface of the planet."" The Conference concluded that we cannot allow the persistence of social imbalances in the current international system marked by inhuman situations of poverty and by the coexistence of want and waste. As stated by the Brazilian Head of State  as President of the Conference  ""We cannot have an environmentally sound planet in a socially unjust world"". The Rio Conference therefore fostered an awareness of the fact that development must be sustainable. Sustainability requires due attention not only to environmental but also to economic and social factors. That and all the other achievements of the Conference were made possible thanks only to the unprecedented engagement of the community of nations at the highest level  allowing for the consideration of problems of universal interest through the equal participation of all countries. Let me stress this point: The Rio Conference was exemplary in that it brought to a higher level the practice of democracy in international relations  thus strengthening multilateral diplomacy. At the Conference  all countries - large and small  rich and poor gave proof that they were and are capable of linking their own specific interests with larger  more general interests. This is the ""spirit of Rio""  which we hope will guide the United Nations in other areas as well: mutual confidence among States  a willingness to act decisively with a view to achieving common goals  and the grandeur of joint endeavours in devising forms of enhanced cooperation in line with norms defined democratically and on the basis of consensus. This session of the General Assembly is called upon to address the task of taking the first steps in implementing the conclusions of the Conference and in honouring the commitments entered into at Rio. We therefore attribute great importance to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Sustainable development requires new and additional financial resources on an adequate and predictable basis  as reflected in chapter 33 of Agenda 21. We expect that  at the present session  the developed countries will announce initial plans to give effect to the goals of the Conference. Equally crucial is the availability of technology to developing countries  so as to ensure the feasibility of established programmes. Action or follow-up measures are also necessary in other areas; among these I stress the development of small island States and the convening of a negotiating committee on desertification. Brazil wishes to make an additional contribution to the accomplishments of the Rio Conference by offering to host an international centre for studies on sustainable development. We count on public and private support for this initiative  which was welcomed in a resolution adopted at the Conference and for the implementation of which we have already laid the groundwork. As an academic institution  the centre will provide an international research and exchange forum for the application of decisions adopted at Rio. When I spoke about the dichotomy between the real and the ideal necessary for the construction of a new order  I referred to the great opportunities for cooperation among nations to solve problems in the areas of peace and security  democracy  human rights  development and environment. The world expects the work of the Organization to be concentrated on those priority areas. The capacity for joint action by the United Nations must spring from the voice of each and every Member State. That action becomes all the more legitimate as the basic decision-making process grows more representative and more democratic. Brazil views the ongoing work on the restructuring and revitalization of the economic and social sectors of the United Nations as eminently relevant. It should lead to greater efficiency  together with a wider scope for international cooperation for development. An agenda for peace cannot overlook the agenda for development. Ultimate success in this enterprise requires a realistic willingness to endow the United Nations with the necessary instruments and the prospective vision to make this universal forum the core of collective efforts for the improvement of relations among peoples and countries. In Brazil  as elsewhere in Latin America and other regions  bold and necessary reforms have been set in motion to eliminate obstacles to development  to economic competitiveness  to technological progress and to the free exercise of innovation and entrepreneurship based on the market. Brazil joins other nations with an open mind  aware of the need for creative adaptation to new realities and convinced that new challenges require a vision of the future endowed with generosity. "
"24",1001,"BRB",47,1992,"It is a pleasure for me to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election to the presidency of the Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am confident that our deliberations will benefit from his wise leadership. I also commend his predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for the outstanding stewardship he provided during the course of the last year  and I take this opportunity too to extend my personal welcome and good wishes to our new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. I am pleased to greet the many new Members that have joined the United Nations family since the beginning of the last session and to offer them the full cooperation of the delegation of Barbados as we work together to shape the international order for the twenty-first century. The old world order has disintegrated at an astonishing pace. Assumptions and doctrines based on the cold-war balance of power have lost their relevance. At the same time  ambitious expectations have been created for the emergence of a new world order based on peaceful coexistence  economic equity and social justice. The transition  however  has proved more traumatic and destabilizing than the propitious circumstances would have suggested. The energies for revolutionary change need to be positively directed so that prospects for international peace are not threatened by the resurgence of ancient ethnic and tribal conflicts and the violent clash of nationalistic rivalries. Regrettably  there are alarming manifestations of that new threat in Yugoslavia and Somalia. Barbados is appalled at the savagery with which the protagonists of ethnic strife in what was once Yugoslavia are pursuing their misguided notions of nationalism and sovereignty. Such barbarism  including the horrendous practice of ""ethnic cleansing""  has no place in our modern world. Its perpetrators must be made to understand the outrage of the international community at their actions. My country fully supports the regime of sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the dedicated efforts of the European Community and the United Nations to create the conditions for a peaceful settlement and to bring relief to the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilian victims. Equally disturbing is the desperate situation in Somalia  which  regrettably  has only recently attracted the international attention it deserves  and then only at the sharp prodding of the Secretary-General. Barbados supports regional and international efforts towards the convening of o conference on national reconciliation and unity in Somalia and towards creating secure conditions for humanitarian action. My country commends the Secretary General's report ""An Agenda for Peace"" to the Assembly for its careful study. A number of its recommendations are consistent with the views contained in my statement to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session  namely  the need to strengthen the capability of the Secretary-General for preventive diplomacy; the need to put into place the permanent enforcement tools required under Article 43 of the Charter to deter  and in the last resort  counter aggression; and the need to make full use of the appropriate regional and subregional security arrangements under Chapter VIII of the Charter. We also support his call for greater recourse to the International Court of Justice for the peaceful adjudication of disputes. My delegation supports the view of the Secretary-General that there is an urgent necessity to put peace-keeping operations on a sound financial footing. His recommendations and other positive suggestions should be given Priority study. A number of small countries have been unable to play a part in traditional United Nations peace-keeping simply because they have lacked the logistical military capability for so doing. The expanded dimensions of peace-keeping  however  provide the possibility for participation by small States in other fields in which they have expertise  such as electoral supervision  human-rights monitoring and the supply of police and civilian personnel. Such participation should be encouraged and facilitated by the Organization. In this regard  my delegation has noted with interest the Norwegian proposal for the establishment of a special United Nations institute for education and training in peace-keeping and related activities as a means to respond to these new dimensions. While we cannot fail to recognize the indispensable nature of United Nations peace-keeping operations  my country is nevertheless concerned at the dramatic escalation in their costs and would wish to see more stringent controls and oversight in place to ensure efficient use of the billions of dollars now involved. An agenda for peace requires a supportive economic environment. A new world order must be developed around the central priority of closing the gap between North and South  '.'his requires courageous leadership on the part of the North to create the opportunities for sustainable economic and social development in the South through genuine trade liberalization  meaningful debt-relief strategies and positive resource transfers. It also requires responsible management; sound  people-oriented development planning; and the creation of the appropriate environment for development on the part of the South. The United Nations is a critical forum for the resuscitation of the international economic dialogue. Barbados welcomes the serious debate now taking place on reforming and strengthening the economic and social mandate of the United Nations. Any such reform must be consistent with the provisions of the Charter and seek to ensure universality and accessibility. Care must be taken not to exclude the small and powerless from the process. Regrettably  however  the emphasis currently given to developmental issues within the administrative structure of the Organization does not reflect the priority accorded to those issues by the majority of Member States. My delegation accepts that the maintenance of international peace and security is a major responsibility of the United Nations. We strongly support the view that peace and economic and social well-being are indivisible and that issues relating to development must be given emphasis equal to that given to issues relating to peace. It is important that the United Nations be a forum for constructive consensus-building  where all points of view no matter the size of their proponents or how much influence they wield are given equal attention and respect. A new world order cannot evolve except in an atmosphere of free and open dialogue  consultation and transparency in decision-making. There is considerable merit in the argument that the Security Council in the post-cold-war era should be updated to reflect the new international political and economic realities  as well as the balance and diversity necessary for its decisions  if it is to command universal acceptance and respect. A very topical issue in this forum in recent times has been the dialogue on what the Secretary-General has termed ""the democratization of international relations and the participation of all States in developing new norms of international life"". There have been calls for the redefinition of the concept of State sovereignty in international law  and many States have accepted as a matter of policy the notion of the right to intervene on humanitarian grounds and for the protection of human rights  and have advocated the universal application of such a principle. My country has always been outspoken on the universal need to protect and strengthen the principles of democracy and respect for fundamental human rights. We have consistently condemned abuses  wherever and whenever they have occurred  and long before the resurgence of democratic values in our region and elsewhere made it popular or safe to do so. Our actions have always been motivated strictly by principle and objectivity  and not by ideological considerations that have served in the past to politicize the debate. The disappearance of ideological polarization gives the international community an unprecedented opportunity to influence the dialogue on this vital issue in a balanced and constructive way. There is need to ensure respect for fundamental human rights; out there is equal need to take care to promote impartial standards for measuring adherence to  and for guarding scrupulously against manipulation of  the debate to suit the narrow foreign policy interests of particular States. What is needed in the ensuing dialogue is the sensitive and sensible application of universally agreed standards  not the imposition of new forms of conditionality devoid of all historical or cultural context. The World Conference on Human Rights  scheduled to be held in Vienna in June 1993  will present a unique opportunity not only to review the progress made in human rights since 1948  but also to formulate recommendations aimed at charting the course of human rights well into the twenty-first century. The tragic situation of the people of Haiti remains a major preoccupation of the Government and people of Barbados and of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) as a whole. We have made clear our outright condemnation of the usurpation of the authority of the legitimate government of President Aristide  and have collaborated with our regional partners in CARICOM and the Organization of American States (OAS) in the effort to restore that government. We have supported the OAS-imposed embargo and the Protocol of Washington. It is clear  however  that no lasting solution can be found  except in a context that neutralizes the power of a brutal and lawless military  which continues with impunity its flagrant abuses of the human rights of the Haitian people. The international community has a special obligation towards the people of Haiti  whose electoral process was monitored and authenticated at every step with direct United Nations involvement. If such a process can be overturned with impunity  what message are we sending to the world of would-be dictators  and what assurance are we providing for the fledgling democracies in our region? It is imperative that the United Nations take action to internationalize the embargo and to contribute  in whatever ways are considered appropriate and useful  to OAS efforts towards the restoration of the Aristide government. Barbados is greatly encouraged by the decision reached by the De Klerk Government and by Mr. Mandela on 26 September 1992 to resume negotiations with a view to establishing an interim government and a constituent assembly in South Africa. The release of 150 political prisoners and the promise by the South African Government to release the remaining political prisoners by 15 November 1992 represent a significant development that satisfies an important condition of the United Nations Declaration on southern Africa. Barbados deplores the violence that has been a major obstacle to reform in South Africa  and holds the De Klerk Government fully responsible for failing to curb it. The role of the United Nations remains critical to reform efforts in South Africa. We therefore welcome the deployment of 50 United Nations observers in South Africa to assist with the implementation of the National Peace Accord  and hope that the size of this contingent will be increased  if necessary. We urge all the parties to collaborate in maintaining an environment free of violence and to participate in peaceful negotiations aimed at achieving a non-racial  democratic South Africa. We are also encouraged by the current dialogue in the Middle East. We hope that all parties will make every effort to achieve a just and lasting peace. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)  which took place in Rio de Janeiro in June this year  was perhaps the most ambitious and far-reaching United Nations-sponsored gathering ever held. It served a vital purpose in focusing world attention on the interrelationship between human development and the environment  and in fostering global awareness of the importance of the concept of sustainable development to the future survival of our planet and all its inhabitants. Barbados cannot pretend to be fully satisfied with the results of the Rio Conference. It was  however  an important beginning in the process towards an international blueprint for sustainable development in the twenty-first century. The creation of a high-level sustainable development commission is an important element in providing serious follow-up to the decisions of Agenda 21. Care must be taken to ensure the widest possible access to  and participation in  the work of the Commission by the full membership of the United Nations. Barbados has signed the Conventions on Climate Change and on Biological Diversity  and is taking the necessary steps at the domestic level to ensure their early ratification. We reiterate  however  that there is an urgent need to begin work on a protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change that specifically addresses stabilization and reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. My country is heartened that one of the significant achievements at UNCED was the recognition given to the special environmental and development needs of small island developing States  leading to the inclusion in Agenda 21 of a specific plan of action for the sustainable development of small island developing States. In this regard  my delegation wishes to place on record its deep appreciation of the sterling efforts of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)  whose contribution to the success of the Conference cannot be overstated. As part of the plan to identify and address the special needs of this category of States  a global conference will be convened in 1993. Barbados is honoured to reiterate its offer to host that Conference. The vulnerability of our environment and the fragility of our marine ecosystems require constant vigilance to guard against deliberate or accidental degradation. In this connection  we echo the concerns of the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis about the possible passage through our region of plutonium or other hazardous material. The opportunities provided for shaping a truly harmonious new world order are enormous. The danger of failure is  however  equally great  unless the redefinition of our future takes place with equal participation by all the members of the global family. Never before has the power of the few over the destinies of the many been so apparent  and never before has it been so vital to the survival of the majority of small and powerless States that make up the United Nations for that power to be used responsibly. "
"25",1033,"BRN",47,1992,"I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am sure he will guide us well. I should like also to thank the outgoing President  His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi. His valuable contribution to the work of the United Nations was much appreciated. I wish also to thank the Secretary-General for his efforts on behalf of peace in the world. His report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  should be given urgent attention by Member countries. I offer the Secretary-General my continued support in all his demanding work. This year  we are very pleased to greet the new Members of the United Nations. Their admission should further strengthen our Organization. Since last year's session we have continued to see great changes in the world. Brunei Darussalam welcomed most of them. However  we have approached others with caution. This is because we are not yet sure what they will lead to. Generally  though  we feel that the Members of the world body are now in a better position than ever before to build a just and lasting peace in the world. However  we believe that certain things must be in place before any United Nations action can have a good chance of success. These are strong bilateral relationships between individual countries which lead to multilateral cooperation through regional associations. We feel that these two structures are essential. It is our view that  if they exist  the United Nations will be able to function well in terms of both peace-keeping and peace-building. We think they are required because no one nation or single organization is able to stand alone. That is why my country  like many others  has been engaged in intense diplomatic activity over the past year. We feel we have to establish a wide range of bilateral relations and participate fully in regional and international organizations. We think that  in this way  even small nations such as ours can contribute a great deal to the success of this Organization. We would like to see United Nations action complementing regional and international institutions. I feel that this is illustrated by the part the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) has played in finding a solution to the Cambodian problem. ASEAN's hard work and patience in the initial stages was crucial. So were the efforts of other concerned and interested parties. Also  the willingness of the Cambodians themselves to seek a peaceful solution was a most significant factor. The peace accord sponsored by the United Nations was built on this foundation. The situation in Cambodia today may offer a further illustration. We believe it shows that peace-building does not necessarily end when an agreement is signed. The effort must still go on. A continuing spirit of cooperation among all parties to any international settlement must be encouraged. We  therefore  see reasons for optimism in our own part of the world. But we do not overlook realities elsewhere. We are glad to note that  even in some very difficult situations  individual countries are trying to play their part in bringing peace and stability to their regions. We are particularly glad to see this happening in the Middle East. The peace talks sponsored by the United States and Russia are providing the countries concerned with the means to make peaceful progress. Certainly  the core problem of Palestine has not yet been resolved  and we regret that the Israelis still defy Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). But in spite of all this  we see some progress. For this reason  we urge everyone involved to try to make the talks succeed. At the same time  we feel that the United Nations still has an important role to play in the search for a solution. We believe that the world body should increase its effort to help bring about peaceful change in South Africa. This would strengthen the considerable efforts made by institutions such as the Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity. In our opinion  there are sound reasons for the United Nations to be involved in Cambodia  the Middle East and South Africa. This is because certain favourable conditions have been created by those directly involved. Unfortunately  this cannot always be the case. The situation in the Balkans seems likely to be typical of the dilemmas the world body may be forced to face in the future. On the one hand  there is a need to act because of our moral and human obligations. On the other hand  there may be no framework of good sense  reason and peaceful intent established at all levels. Calls for United Nations action in similar circumstances may multiply. That is why I do not feel we can consider peace and security only in their political context. We see them as closely linked with economic development. Here I refer to the grave social and economic problems faced by a great number of developing nations. They pose a considerable threat to those countries' internal security and  therefore  to international stability. If present conditions continue  developing countries will be in no position to undertake peaceful cooperation. This could mean that the United Nations is called upon time and again to try to solve local conflicts under very difficult circumstances. We therefore think it is vital that developing and developed countries engage in peace-building together. We feel there is an urgent need to provide the building blocks of international peace today. These take the form of cooperative international trading relations. In my view  the first test we all face is whether we can bring about a successful conclusion to the current Uruguay Round. Other things should then fall into place  such as open markets and the free transfer of modern technology to developing nations. Those seem to me to be the most practical ways in which we all can engage in preventive diplomacy. They will ensure that the primary role of the United Nations is not only to solve political crises but also to help individual nations and regions build their own peace in their own way. "
"26",1075,"BTN",47,1992,"I have the honour to convey to you and to all the representatives here the warm greetings of His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck  King of Bhutan  and his good wishes for the success of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I should first like to congratulate you  Sir  on your election as president of the forty-seventh session of the Assembly. Your unanimous election is testimony to the high regard the international community has for your country and the Assembly's confidence that your leadership will provide the necessary direction on many important issues that we shall take up during this session. I should like to take this opportunity to place on record our deep appreciation to Mr. Samir S. Shihabi  for the excellent manner in which he conducted the proceedings of our last session. I wish to extend our warm welcome to the Governments and peoples of all the new Members of "" ¬∞ United Nations. The large number of new Members is testimony not only to t' 3 historic changes that are taking place in the world  but also to the universality and importance of the United Nations. We welcome them and look forward to the opportunity to work together. During the last three years the world has witnessed the disappearance of the ideological conflict that had divided it and pervaded every aspect of social and economic life for much of this century. While these sweeping changes have brought new opportunities for peace  stability and progress  hopes have been dampened on the one hand by the unleashing of old hostilities and new conflicts  and on the other by the further impoverishment of millions of people for whom the changes in the international scene have little meaning. The social and economic situation remains dismal not only in many developing countries but also in many developed countries which are suffering from a prolonged recession. Though the opportunity for peace and progress has never been better  the challenges of inequity and poverty  which are the main reasons for instability and conflict  continue to be daunting as ever. In many ways the United Nations has been the greatest beneficiary of the changes in international affairs. After many years of blatant disregard and even disrespect by many and a lack of confidence in its abilities by others  the international community is now increasingly turning to the United Nations. There is greater willingness on the part of everybody to work through the Organization. In this context we should like to record our appreciation to our previous Secretary-General  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  for having created this opportunity and increased respect for the United Nations. We should also like to express our admiration and appreciation to our present Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for taking immediate steps to make the Organization relevant and more responsive to the needs of the world  particularly in the area of conflict. We share his views on the need for immediate peace-keeping and peace-making and for greater emphasis on conflict resolution. Above all  we share his view on the need to give equal importance and attention to conflict and suffering wherever they may be in the world. The situation in the Middle East continues to be a major concern for global peace. While the unnecessary and senseless aggression against the peaceful people of Kuwait has been reversed  the issue of prisoners and disarmament remains. This new confrontation has added another dimension to the region  where peace and stability have already been denied for a long time. We fully appreciate the efforts of the sponsors of the dialogue that is taking place on the Middle East. We sincerely hope that the talks will defuse the conflict and pave the way for peace in the region. However  this process will not be successful unless the question of Palestine and occupied Arab lands is addressed and the legitimate rights of the Palestinians to self-determination in their homeland are guaranteed. Equally  the territorial integrity of Lebanon and the security and safety of all States in the region  including Israel  must be assured. Only then will there be meaningful peace in the region. In South Africa  while there has been progress towards change  the process has been continuously marred by a heavy toll in human lives. The violence must stop and the talks should continue. The inevitable course of change should not be restrained any further. While the cold war has ended  one of its last remnants still stands in the division of the Korean peninsula. We welcome the recent exchanges between the two countries and believe they will eventually lead to unification. We fully support the pragmatic steps set forth by President Roh Tae Woo of the Republic of Korea in his address to this session and share his vision of the Korean peninsula presenting itself as one nation before this body in the near future. The supply of arms over the years has made it possible for conflicts in Somalia and other regions of the world to continue despite the major changes in the international scene. The results have been tragic  and we cannot but emphasize the immediate need for humanitarian assistance and for resolution of the problems. The disappearance of the bipolar world has provided the best opportunity for ending the arms race and bringing about complete disarmament. The chance to direct all efforts and resources from the production of weapons of mass destruction towards the service of humanity must not be allowed to slip by. While there has been reduction of major weapons  the production and supply of smaller arms have continued to thrive in many parts of the world. Developing countries can ill afford to spend their resources on such unproductive and destructive enterprises. The tragedies of war and conflict are not the only factors contributing to human suffering. While they may be dramatic and require immediate attention  more suffering is taking place on a day-to-day basis  involving millions of people in the world. Just as it is important to end conflict  it is essential that the problems of poverty be addressed. The decade of the 1980s produced few  if any  positive results in the field of socio-economic development; consequently  the living conditions of only a few are better than when the decade started. The International Development Strategy for the 1990s  adopted by the General Assembly at its eighteenth special session; the Cartagena Commitments agreed to at the Eighth Conference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VIII); the Rio Declaration of the Earth Summit; and the Jakarta Message of the Tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement all call for renewed efforts in international development in the decade ahead. On the otherwise discouraging scheme there have been two important events: the World Summit for Children  in September 1990  and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro in June this year. The children's Summit clearly drew our attention to the need to redouble our efforts to give our children the necessary care  attention and education if we are to ensure a better future for humanity. The Earth Summit clearly established the common stake we all have in the well being of the planet. It recognized that  while the responsibility for preserving the delicate ecological balance falls on all nations  at the same time those responsible for its degradation and abuse must be held accountable. Our planet can no longer sustain a high level of exploitation  and there must be a willingness on the part of those placing a high demand on natural resources to reduce consumption. At the same time more resources are necessary to improve the conditions and meet the basic needs of billions of people in developing countries  particularly the more than 1.1 billion people who live in absolute poverty. As further misuse of the earth's finite resources would be disastrous  the only alternative is a greater willingness to share. The high pace of population growth and the resulting increase in demand on resources is a serious threat to the environment and to the future. Developing countries  where 4.3 billion of today's population of 5.5 billion live  and where nearly all the next billions will be added in the decades ahead  must take all measures to ensure that population and development are balanced in a sustainable manner. The next three to four decades will be the most challenging humanity has ever faced  as they will determine the long-term survival of our planet. Just as we have a common stake in the environment and social well being  our futures are also tied in terms of overall global economic health. The slow recovery in the North from a long protracted recession has affected all countries. Similarly  the economic strength of developing countries clearly affects economic opportunities for the North. The long established target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance has not been reached by most donor countries and is not likely to be during this century. Official development assistance  whether through bilateral or through multilateral channels  has been set back not only in terms of slow growth but also in terms of slow disbursement resulting from increasing modalities and conditionalities. The question of debt still awaits comprehensive solution after more than a decade of discussion. Both the need for debt relief and the requirement of additional credit must be dealt with in a fair and comprehensive manner. The serious imbalances in international trade in terms of prices for commodities as well as volume of trade must be made more stable. Trade is one of the few avenues available to developing countries for progress  and must not be restricted. It is also necessary that access to knowledge and technology be made easier. Our discussions on development and political change must take into account the human and social dimensions. There is increasing social tension and disregard for human dignity arising out of poverty  high population growth and resulting unemployment  migration and competition for scarce resources. The wholesome well being of individuals and their rights can be assured if there are stable social  economic  political and natural environments. We look forward to the Second World Conference on Human Rights  in 1993  and the proposed world summit for social development to address these important issues in an integrated manner. In my own country  Bhutan  development activities started only in the 1960s. Since then  major changes have taken place: an effective fiscal and financial management system  a basic network of social services  roads connecting all population centres  and a growing export sector comprised of energy  minerals and agricultural products have been established. The development of human resources and the preservation of our rich environment have been given special attention. Despite the considerable progress  our economic infrastructure remains inadequate  and the country's communications and transport systems require expansion. In addition to the problems all least developed countries face  Bhutan is further handicapped by being landlocked. Bhutan has always taken full responsibility for its own development  and we will continue to do so  but the progress we have made thus far would not have been possible without generous support  particularly that of India  Japan  Switzerland  Denmark  Kuwait  Austria  Norway  the Netherlands  Germany  the United Kingdom and Australia and various agencies and bodies of the United Nations  in particular the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Children's Fund  the International Fund for Agricultural Development  the United Nations Capital Development Fund  the World Health Organization  the World Food Programme  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the United Nations Volunteers  the United Nations Population Fund  the United Nations Department of Technical Cooperation for Development and the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization. I take this opportunity to express the sincere gratitude and appreciation of the people and Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan to our development partners. One of the important issues before the Assembly is the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. We fully welcome such a commission  but we must emphasize that its mandate and relationship to existing organizations must be very clear  and its task must contribute tangibly and substantively to socio-economic development. Let it not be one of the multitude of international organizations struggling to bring about development. The strengthening  revitalization and reorganization of the United Nations must extend to all its organs and organizations. In this context we welcome the concrete steps that our Secretary-General has taken in streamlining the Secretariat. The United Nations is finally being geared to undertake its peace-keeping  peace-making and humanitarian relief work effectively. We urge that a similar effort be made to ensure that the multitude of organs and agencies involved in development be streamlined and revitalized with the same vigour. We have listened carefully to the various views on reforming and democratizing the United Nations. This is an extremely important matter that must take into account the significant historical changes and the current membership of the international body. There is need for a new enlightened balance among the principal organs of the United Nations. The General Assembly must be provided with more responsibility  and the International Court of Justice with more authority. Finally  the United Nations is no longer the hostage of ideological conflict and now has new found respect and confidence. While this opportunity must not be missed  the path ahead is a long one  and the United Nations must move quickly to make itself relevant and capable of meeting the responsibilities it has long not been permitted to carry out. But above all the United Nations must be fair in fulfilling the aspirations and meeting the hopes and needs of all its Members  big and small. "
"27",1116,"BWA",47,1992," I am pleased to extend to you. Sir  and to your country  Bulgaria  the sincere congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. I have no doubt that under your able leadership this session will be a great success. In the short space of time since he assumed office at the beginning of the year  our new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has more than justified the confidence reposed in him and his prodigious qualities and abilities by his election to the highly demanding office of Secretary-General. He has been  during these nine turbulent months  more than a match for the daunting crises that have so far characterized the so-called new world order. We salute him and his equally dedicated colleagues in the Secretariat. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a rare moment in history. It is a moment so brilliantly captured in the language of Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  wherein are written these words: ""The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage ..."". (resolution 217 A (III)  article 21  para. 3) Peoples across the globe are marching triumphantly to seize control of their own destinies through the ballot. This has been clearly manifested in the admission of seven new Members during the forty-sixth regular session of the General Assembly and many more at its resumed meetings. The membership of those new States enhances the universality of the United Nations. We warmly welcome their presence in our midst. The end of the cold war has triggered an avalanche of demands on the United Nations at a time when the Organization is tottering on the verge of bankruptcy. The Organization is being called upon to be everywhere where there is a problem and to carry out activities ranging from peace-keeping and peacemaking in areas ravaged by civil wars to fighting natural disasters. It is also required to play a role in areas where democracy is being embraced. The financing of both the United Nations activities under its regular budget and its peace-keeping operations has never been more crucial to the role and function of the Organization. For many years the Organization was paralysed by ideological confrontation  and it is unfortunate that it should now be hamstrung in the performance of its functions by financial emergency and crisis in an era when there is so much good will. The issue is simple: the machinery of the United Nations cannot be expected to function effectively and efficiently when it has run out of financial steam. We can all bear testimony to the success of the United Nations system when there is a common desire and will to put the system to work. The assessed contributions have to be paid in full and on time  in accordance with the Charter. All arrears have to be paid as a demonstration of our commitment to the process of renewal and revitalization currently going on in the world and within the United Nations itself. Botswana has followed with grave concern the tragic events in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the senseless killing and brutality visited on innocent men  women and children. It is indeed unfortunate that while many States in Eastern and Central Europe have experienced relatively peaceful transitions to democracy and political pluralism  the people of the former Yugoslavia  the founding champion and leader of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  should be bleeding so hopelessly. Yugoslavia was a critical factor for stability in Central Europe during the lark days of super-Power rivalry and military confrontation. However  we cannot be distracted from present reality by the past. The international community has been rightfully outraged by acts of barbarism in a world increasingly characterized by civilized conduct in inter-State relations. The agreements reached at the London Conference  which enjoy the overwhelming approbation of the international community  must be implemented in full by all the parties involved in the brutal conflict. No effort should be spared in ensuring the restoration of lasting peace in the Balkans. In South-East Asia  the brave and courageous men and women of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) continue to work quietly and tirelessly to bring about peace and stability in that country. It is hoped that all parties to the Agreement on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict will honour their obligations. The people of Cambodia have long awaited the day when they can return to their homes  walk in the streets and till the soil without fear of land mines. The implementation of the peace agreement is a monumental task the likes of which this world body has never before undertaken. It is vitally important that the efforts of the United Nations succeed in timely and effective fashion. A situation in which the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) might be marooned in Cambodia  with the financial burden that would entail  must be avoided at all cost. The Middle East peace talks which opened in Washington  D.C.  on 24 August 1992 and which have now been suspended have given us cause for optimism. The atmosphere which has been created at the talks augurs well for serious negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement. We fully support the process under jay and encourage the parties to the negotiations to ensure that this historic opportunity is not squandered. In Afghanistan  it is our sincere hope that the establishment of a transitional Government will silence the guns  which for 14 years wreaked death  misery and disaster on innocent civilians and on belligerents alike. The international community  in particular those Member States that have strong ties with the parties to the conflict  should bring maximum pressure to bear on the parties to refrain from resorting to the use of force in settling their differences. In Somalia  a human tragedy of unspeakable dimensions is unfolding before our very eyes. According to a report of the Secretary-General contained in document S/24480 of 24 August 1992  famine threatens the lives of 4.5 million people. On a daily basis  many are dying a slow and painful death. It is regrettable that the response of the international community was painfully slow at the beginning of the tragedy. However  there were  and there continue to be  men and women whose devotion to humanitarian service and reverence for human life are unparalleled in their quality and dimension. The International Red Cross was there when no one else was. Its dedication to alleviating human suffering is truly extraordinary. The great son of a Lutheran pastor and 1952 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Dr. Albert Schweitzer  once said ""There is no higher religion than human service. To work for the common good is the greatest creed."" The Red Cross deserves our gratitude and commendation. In equal measure  we commend the efforts of the Secretary-General in securing the agreement and approbation of the parties to the conflict  in the face of immense difficulties  so that humanitarian assistance could reach the suffering people. We also welcome the decision of the Security Council to deploy an additional 3 000 observers in Somalia. In South Africa  at the time of their suspension three difficult months ago  the negotiations conducted within the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) had undeniably achieved positive results. A substantial degree of consensus had been achieved within a relatively short time  considering that less than two years ago the apartheid edifice was still very much intact  barely shaken  and prospects for change in South Africa were as bleak as they could be. Now  we have seen what the three-month hiatus has wrought more massacres as brutal at that at Boipatong  which caused the break-up of the negotiations in June. The recent one at Bisho in the Bantustan of Ciskei  however  seems to have had a sobering effect on the South African leaders. If anything at all  these massacres have shown that negotiations are the only hope for South Africa  and it is with a sigh of relief that we welcome the resumption of the negotiation process. We welcome the keen interest the world community has shown in the South African crisis  as evidenced by the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 772 (1992) of 17 August 1992. The involvement of the international community in the process of change in South Africa is a very crucial element. It is our sincere hope that the United Nations observers mentioned in operative paragraph 4 of that Security Council resolution- will be deployed in full and kept in place throughout the process of negotiation  or as long as it is deemed necessary and vital to keep them there. Progress  if any  towards the resolution of the Western Sahara issue has been too slow  to say the least. The people of Western Sahara should be given the opportunity to exercise their right to national self-determination freely and fairly under international supervision. No obstacles should be placed in the way of the settlement plan. Recent developments in Angola and Mozambique mark the dawn of a new era in southern Africa. A situation of peace and stability is now gaining momentum. The signing of the General Peace Agreement by the President of Mozambique  Mr. Joaquim Chissano  and by the leader of RENAMO  Mr. Afonso Dhlakama  is a major development in the process of bringing peace to Mozambique. Botswana contributed in its small way to the process  and I had the honour to witness the signing of the Agreement in Rome on 4 October. I hope that the international community will extend political  diplomatic and moral support to Mozambique in order to ensure that the Agreement is translated into solid peace. Millions of Mozambicans face starvation and death because of the war and drought. The signing of the General Peace Agreement opens the door for the United Nations agencies and other international relief agencies  and the international community as a whole  to alleviate the suffering of the people of Mozambique  as well as to assist with the means to reconstruct their country. For the first time since it acceded to independence in 1975  Angola held multiparty elections last week. The high turn-out for the elections indicates the readiness of the Angolan people to use the ballot rather than the bullet to resolve their differences. I hope that this high turn-out  coupled with free and fair elections  will bestow legitimacy on the new Government. What is of paramount importance however  is the agreement made by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the Union for the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA) to form a Government of national unity irrespective of whichever party wins the elections. This is the second time the United Nations has successfully supervised multiparty elections in southern Africa. The role of the United Nations in the peace process in Angola is therefore truly commendable. There is an intricate relationship between peace and security and economic and social development. There can be no doubt that the problems of poverty  unemployment  huge foreign debt  budget deficits  lack of market access  high interest rates and the environment are not the problems of any one country or group of countries. No one country can solve them in isolation. The macroeconomic management of the global economy should now be guided by the need to serve common interests. There should be an end to the perception of problems as being exclusively those of the North or of the South. A new approach is required  one that will identify the common problems of humanity and build on the consensus. We should put an end to mutual distrust  and move away from perceiving the economic concerns of countries as being mutually exclusive and permanently at loggerheads. This is not a zero-sum game. The lessons of our recent past should guide us. The world was united in its opposition to aggression against Kuwait  and concerted efforts were made to mobilize resources in support of the countries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States; all of this showed an acceptance of the validity of the concepts of interdependence  partnership and the ""global village."" In 1993 a World Conference on Human Rights will be held  followed by the 1994 Conference on Population and Development. And in 1995  as the United Nations celebrates its golden jubilee  the World Conference on Women will take place. This attests to the fact that these are shared human problems and therefore require our collective endeavours. There should be a move away from the temptation to accord the highest priority to human rights and democracy  to the detriment of other areas of primary concern. It serves no useful purpose to have priorities based solely on political considerations and what are perceived as strategic national interests. Democracy is threatened when the legitimate expectations of the people are frustrated by economic deprivation. In this regard  we strongly support the proposal to convene a world summit for social development in 1995. It is our fervent hope that a consensus decision will be reached on this matter of critical importance to the world as a whole. The Summit should afford the international community the opportunity to address in an integrated manner the problems of poverty  illiteracy  disease  unemployment and poor living conditions. The economic situation in Africa is still bleak. Africa continues to experience a crushing debt burden  falling commodity prices and painful structural adjustment programmes. The economies of many African countries have stagnated or retrogressed during the past year. The African economic crisis is a development challenge to mankind's collective conscience. Concerted efforts should be made to translate the United Nations New Agenda for Africa into concrete programmes and projects that can put our continent on the path to economic recovery and development. The Global Coalition for Africa (GCA)  which I have the honour to co-chair on behalf of Africa  has made a significant contribution to the new consensus-building process since its inception in Maastricht in 1990. As a forum that brings together  at the highest level  policy makers from Africa and its international partners  the GCA has great potential in the search for solutions to Africa's most critical development issues. The GCA is a forum for equal engagement  for openness to policy decisions and for great seriousness. Our partnership with the North requires our most determined leadership. It is important that the GCA be Africa-driven  and it is in the interest of Africa to have a forum based on equal partnership. As Chairman of the former Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC)  I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the member States recently signed in Windhoek  Namibia  a Treaty and Protocol establishing the Southern African Development Community (SADC). This historic development is part of the overall efforts of the countries of the subregion to enhance and intensify inter-regional cooperation. SADCC had been in existence for 12 years as a loose arrangement between members. Those very fruitful years armed us with the courage  wisdom and experience to transform the loose arrangement that was the SADCC into the formal entity that is the SADC. The establishment of SADC is part and parcel of continental efforts to create an African economic community; it is without a doubt one of the community's building blocks. The establishment of SADC takes place against the backdrop of a serious drought crisis ravaging southern Africa. The response of the international community has been very positive  but the magnitude of the crisis is daunting. The scope and extent of its impact continue to unfold  necessitating a revised estimation of the resources needed to alleviate the plight of the most seriously affected populations. We appeal to the members of the international donor community who have not yet done so to convert their pledges into concrete contributions to avert a human tragedy. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development adopted a number of important decisions which are now before the General Assembly for follow-up and implementation. We attach the utmost importance to the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and the Programme of Action outlined in Agenda 21. In this regard  we fully support the recommendation to the General Assembly on the establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development. The Rio Summit was the beginning of a process which should now find concrete expression in the form of the commitment by Member States to honour their obligations. Of particular importance is the need for resources to implement Agenda 21. Drought and desertification threaten the economic prospects of many developing countries. It is imperative that urgent measures be taken to find an integrated solution to the problem. We strongly believe that this can be done within the framework of negotiations on a convention on desertification. This is a matter of critical importance to many African States  and a positive decision will contribute substantially to the search for solutions to the economic malaise facing our continent. I should like to conclude by reaffirming Botswana's abiding faith in the United Nations and its Charter. We are ready to play our part in our common endeavour to strengthen the Organization to enable it to face the challenges of the twenty-first century. "
"28",1205,"CAN",47,1992," Once again the nations of the world meet in full assembly in this Hall to discuss the state of our world  to report on our actions of the past year  and to express the focus of our intentions in the coming years. Many of us had hoped that this might be a time for celebration  a time for rejoicing  as the deep freeze of a lengthy cold war gave way to the soothing warmth of a new era of enlightenment  understanding  caring and purpose. But we have little joy  and our celebration was certainly short-lived. Whatever insights we may have gained from the cruel and terrible events of the past half century are sorely needed now  in a world that breeds new forms of tyranny  hatred and brutality almost on a daily basis. Many people in this Hall have seen the evidence up close: the bullets  the bodies  and the fear in ordinary men and women  frequently in their own countries. There is  however  no need to lose hope: we have the capacity  and we must continue to build for the future. What we need is the collective will  and I believe that it is in this United Nations  this global forum  that we must dedicate ourselves to securing the peace and stability which have evaded many generations before us  and must build a new world  individual by individual  nation by nation. But  we must remove the double standards that are everywhere. What good are words spoken in this Hall if people at home are unable to speak freely? Why exercise the art of diplomacy here  if it is not supported at home by the science of justice and the skilful application of the rule of law? Can we hope to manage  together  an ever more challenging world when many of our own houses are in disorder? We in Canada  at this very moment  are engaged in our own process of rebuilding  rededication and renewal  a continuing process in real democracies. In four weeks  millions of Canadians will exercise the ultimate democratic right by deciding  through their votes  whether to accept or reject a proposal for fundamental reform of our Canadian Constitution. If accepted  and I have no doubt that it will be  this reform will build on the values and rights which are already a proud part of the Canadian reality. It will strengthen existing guarantees and protection for the rights of minorities  improve the functioning of our already highly regarded democratic institutions  bring greater social and economic justice to our native peoples  and reallocate fundamental roles and responsibilities between levels of government  I am confident that the vast majority of Canadians will support this reform because it is based on fundamental values to which every Canadian subscribes: unswerving respect for the rights of the individual  supported by the rule of law; a strong and deep attachment to democracy  its values and its institutions; a passionate commitment to social justice and economic progress for all; respect for national and international obligations; and a will to resolve differences peacefully through conciliation  compromise and consensus.* As Canadians  we have learned that democracy and freedom can be maintained only by vision and constant vigilance. New ideas for the future must be grounded in the fundamentals that were the original basis for our unity. As Prime Minister Brian Mulroney told Canadians in introducing our Constitution: ""What Canada's leaders have produced is a series of constitutional reforms that strengthen the bonds that brought us together in 1867. These reforms renew the concepts that are at the core of Confederation. They provide a strong framework  a solid foundation  to let us move confidently into the future together."" Obviously  a strong and united Canada is important for Canadians  but it is also of fundamental importance to the nations of the world. The values which Canadians hold  and which we have brought to the world throughout our first 125 years as a nation  are also the values which are fundamental to the Charter of this Organization. It is our belief that here at the United Nations we are not in need of better principles; the drafters of the original Charter have served us well. What we need from this Organization and its Members is the will to act. And we need deeper understanding of the root causes of conflict between nations  so that together we can ""break the chain of violence ... defuse the lust for revenge ... voice [the peoples""] needs ... affirm their dignity"" (A/40/PV.47. p. 23) as our Prime Minister said in this Assembly on the fortieth anniversary of the United Nations seven years ago. I believe that the United Nations has taken up that challenge  and I salute the Secretary-General for his vision and leadership and for his courage in making the Organization more relevant in and to our time. His report  ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  lights our path to the future. The Secretary-General also made the important link between peace nations and peace within nations when he pointed out: ""There is an obvious connection between democratic practices such as the rule of law and transparency in decision-making and the achievement of true peace and security in any new and stable political order.""(A/47/277  para. 59) There are within nation-States three fundamental weaknesses which can cause disputes that go beyond their borders. Primary among these is the absence or abuse of fundamental human rights. If people have no rights  they have no hope; if they have no hope  eventually they will have no fear; and if they have no fear  they will seek any possible means to restore their rights  even killing and dying in the trying. It is a pattern for instability  a pattern for failure  one that has been repeated all too often in the past. The United Nations must lead in the field of human rights. In El Salvador  Cambodia  Croatia  Bosnia  and Somalia efforts to protect human rights are of fundamental importance in attempts to bring peace to these troubled lands. Canada  by the way  is currently serving in all of those places. The 1993 World Conference on Human Rights offers a unique opportunity for all Members of the United Nations to work in a constructive and cooperative spirit to strengthen the foundation of universal respect for human rights. Particularly insidious among the forms of human-rights abuse is systematic discrimination  whether based on gender  race  or ethnic origin. Violence against women remains one of the most serious forms of human-rights abuse. Canada initiated and strongly supports the current work in the United Nations for the adoption of a universal declaration on violence against women  In another context  to eliminate employment discrimination we must also ensure the election and appointment of more women to senior positions in national and international decision-making bodies  including the United Nations. This has been a cornerstone of my Prime Minister's domestic and international appointments policy. But no group should be marginalized; all views  all experiences are important. To this end  Canada is proud to be at the forefront of efforts to prepare for the International Year for the World's Indigenous People  1993  when the international community will turn its attention as never before to the rights of the world's indigenous peoples. Our recently concluded constitutional negotiations in Canada include major advances for indigenous peoples in our own country  which will end years of injustice and inequality in some aspects. As this special Year begins  we also mark the end of the Decade of Disabled Persons. We must continue to remove barriers to the full participation and integration of persons with disabilities. It is our hope that a consensus for ongoing collaboration can be reached in Montreal  where on 8 and 9 October my colleague  the Honourable Robert de Cotret  Canada's Secretary of State  will host an international meeting of Ministers responsible for persons with disabilities. This past year has seen the resurgence of a particularly vile form of abuse of human rights. Canada protests in the strongest possible terms the abhorrent practice of ""ethnic cleansing"". Whatever reason for it  wherever it exists  it represents the basest form of inhumanity and abuse of the individual  and cannot be tolerated by the world community and this Organization. In this connection  Canada calls for the drafting of a statute by the International Law Commission to establish an international criminal court. For this purpose  Canada will shortly convene an international meeting of experts to mobilize legal expertise on this important matter. A second major weakness within many nation-States is the absence of a developed system of democratic values and institutions  and this  too  may ultimately lead to conflict  One should not be fooled by the outward trappings of democracy. How can peace flourish when a democratically elected leader is placed under house arrest  as in Myanmar  or a democratically elected Government is violently overthrown  as in Haiti? A true and lasting democracy requires time and understanding  like a true and lasting friendship. And it requires two-way trust between a nation's peoples and its leaders. We recognize the enormous challenges facing countries where democracy is in its early stages. We must all promote a climate of trust within these emerging democracies  so that new ideas have time to flourish and take root. Canada is doing this through its aid programmes and by its participation in the social and economic agencies of the Organization. A third major weakness within nation-States is the inability to make responsible choices in the management of public policy. Good governance is important  because it ensures that in the provision of government programmes and the distribution of government resources adequate attention is paid to social justice  health and education. It also promotes equitable economic opportunity through the development of a free market system. Ultimately  these are the means to defeat poverty and to ensure that arms purchases and spending on the military are not excessive. Canada's own assistance to developing countries is increasingly focused on and tied to their efforts to protect basic human rights  to develop democratic values and institutions  and to undertake good governance in their policies and programmes. We urge other Member States and the General Assembly to adopt a similar philosophy and similar practices if we are to eradicate the seeds of conflict from within nation-States. These are  of course  resolutions for long-term prevention of conflict. In the meantime  however  we cannot ignore the current state of the world  and that is why the Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  is such an important and pivotal document for this General Assembly. Canada is no stranger to the process of bringing peace to  and keeping peace  in all the regions of the world. Of the 45 000 peace-keeping forces currently serving under the United Nations flag  close to 4 300  or almost 10 per cent  are Canadian. No other nation has made a greater commitment to United Nations peace-keeping than Canada. Canada has served in virtually every United Nations peace-keeping mission  and Canadians currently serve in such varied missions as those in El Salvador  Cambodia  the former Yugoslavia  Somalia and the Middle East. Our experience in these and other missions has taught us that no two missions are the same  and our experience has also taught us that peace-keeping  which is not even mentioned in the United Nations Charter  is a dynamic concept that must be further refined to meet the challenges of the 1990s and beyond. Consequently  we are very pleased that the Secretary-General consulted so broadly on this matter  and we are also pleased that much of our own experience and many of our suggestions are reflected in his final report. We commend the Secretary-General's emphasis on preventive diplomacy and peace-making as the preferred options. We encourage him to continue to use all of the means at his disposal to defuse crises  from fact-finding missions to mediation. We consider it the duty of all Member States to share with the Secretary-General all information that can help him to fulfil his role. We strongly support the concept of preventive peace-keeping  and we urge the Security Council to adopt this option when lives can be saved  confrontation averted or democracy stabilized. In Kosovo  for example  preventive diplomacy by the Security Council and the Secretary-General may well prevent bloodshed and anarchy such as is seen in much of the rest of the region. In the area of peace-making  we agree that the Secretary-General should continue to use mediation and negotiation to facilitate the process of peace  and that the Security Council should avail itself of the provisions of the Charter that permit it to recommend appropriate measures for dispute settlement. We also agree that there is a broader role for the International Court of Justice and that pursuant to Article 96 of the Charter  the Secretary-General be authorized to take advantage of the advisory competence of the Court. I have already alluded to the 4 300 Canadian men and women  20 per cent of our military forces  who are currently committed to United Nations peace-keeping operations. Canada has for many years maintained a battalion on stand-by for United Nations peace-keeping operations. We also have a longstanding policy whereby members of other Canadian forces can be and have been called upon for peace-keeping duties. We are prepared to confirm Canadian arrangements through an exchange of letters with the Secretariat  as suggested in the Secretary-General's report. We urge other countries to do the same. We agree with the need to make available human-rights monitors  electoral officials  refugee and humanitarian specialists and police whatever the situation calls for. We have committed  for example  45 members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to serve with United Nations civilian forces in the former Yugoslavia. And let me add  we believe that countries that make available such civilian experts to the United Nations should have their supplemental costs reimbursed. Whereas ""peace-keeping"" has become very much central to United Nations action and philosophy  the concepts of ""peace enforcement"" and ""peace-building"" are less familiar. We in Canada believe  however  that both will have an increasing role in the future  if the international community is truly dedicated to ending conflict and to enhancing democracy. Of the two  the use of ""enforcement"" is the more controversial. Recent events demonstrate that the use of force may be a necessary option  and we urge full consideration of the Secretary-General's views in this regard. For our part  we insist on the right of Member States to take part in any decision involving their nationals. We also believe that further work is required on an urgent basis to determine the circumstances under which enforcement activities should be undertaken and the limits of potential enforcement action. ""Peace-building""  on the other hand  has been undertaken  most notably in the multidimensional United Nations activities in Cambodia and El Salvador. These operations are long  difficult and costly. Building lasting peace is critical despite those obstacles  not only because of the stability  opportunity and safety it brings to the people most directly affected  but because in the long run it is less difficult  less disruptive  and probably less costly than continued hostilities. Canada  while active in both El Salvador and Cambodia  is fully prepared as well to assist the United Nations in expanding and shaping its approach to peace-building in the future. We support the Secretary-General's proposals for improving the effectiveness and timeliness of peace-keeping operations  and  most notably  for the establishment of a peace-keeping start-up fund of $50 million  and the other proposals in his report. All Member States must pay their dues fully and on time. In May of this year  in the presence of the Secretary-General  Prime Minister Mulroney noted publicly that money is the clearest measure of political will. He went on to say: ""The Secretary-General of the United Nations  the holder of one of the most important offices in the world  should not be treated as a modern-day mendicant  forced to wander around wealthy capitals imploring the decision-makers to pay their bills so that the United Nations can do its job the next day. He must be free to devote his entire time and energy to running the United Nations and solving global problems  rather than passing the hat for peace and security."" Financing a la carte will  over time  erode the United Nations financial base and also weaken the commitment of Member States to the broad range of its activities. Canada is opposed to the recent decision of the Security Council to enlarge the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) at no cost to the United Nations  with the cost to be borne by the participating countries. This sets an unfortunate precedent  and it goes against the United Nations principle of collective responsibility. We also have serious concerns about certain long-standing missions  such as the one in Cyprus  where Canadians and others have served for 28 years. In Cyprus an entire generation has grown up regarding the presence of peace-keepers as part of their everyday norm. We cannot allow the parties in any dispute to institutionalize permanent peace-keepers so that they are just another aspect of the status quo. This is simply unacceptable. The parties involved must accept their responsibility directly and work with the Secretary-General to find a resolution without further delay. We are interested in the Secretary-General's suggestion for increasing cooperation with regional arrangements and organizations in functions such as preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping  peace-making and peace-building. I myself have encouraged the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to develop some of these mechanisms  and Canada  working within the Organization of American States  remains dedicated to a return to democracy in Haiti. There is no doubt in my mind that regional efforts in preventive diplomacy and peace-making should be encouraged. I hope that future developments in those institutions will enable them to carry out peace-keeping operations under certain circumstances. But it is the United Nations which will continue to have the ultimate authority. Expanding the circle of peace-keeping and peace-making organizations may serve to reduce some of the disproportionate burden that in the past certain countries  such as Canada  have willingly assumed. Future needs  however  will require a broadening of participation by Member States. Member States also have a direct responsibility to reduce the numbers and kinds of weapons that are available for conflict. Last year we in this Assembly took a major step to increase transparency in arms sales and to inhibit excessive build-ups of conventional weaponry  with the establishment of the United Nations arms register. This year we can take two even more important steps. The General Assembly  at this session  will launch the preparations for the extension of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty in 1995. An indefinite extension is the only option. France and Russia have declared nuclear-testing moratoriums. Other nuclear Powers the United States  the United Kingdom and China have no reason not to join them. All nuclear-weapon States should observe an immediate moratorium on nuclear testing and should summon up the political will and energy to negotiate a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We are seeing some progress. After many years of difficult negotiations  our negotiators at the Conference on Disarmament have succeeded in producing a chemical-weapons Convention that  when implemented  will ban all chemical weapons for ever. I urge all Member States to join Canada as original signatories when that Convention is opened for signature in Paris next year. There are other substantive issues that I should have liked to discuss in greater detail before the General Assembly today - notably  the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro  where Canada's Prime Minister expressed his strong support for conventions on climate change and on biological diversity  in a ringing call to action: ""As political leaders""  he told his fellow nation-builders  ""our job is to force the pace and stretch out the limits of international cooperation. Nations ... have the human genius to create a world free from deprivation and secure from degradation. What remains is for Governments to provide the leadership the world so desperately needs."" The job of the General Assembly is to continue to stretch those limits and to demonstrate that leadership through the establishment of a commission on sustainable development and a conference on the high seas. There are as well  of course  many issues of process  such as reform of the United Nations development system  that require our immediate time and attention. Canada put forward detailed proposals in this regard in July in the Economic and Social Council  and will continue to take an active role and interest in this matter. What a large task we have set for ourselves. But one of the lessons that we have learned in the post-cold-war era is that there is no breathing space  there is no long pause for contemplation and reflection. Decisions must be made on a timely basis  and when those decisions are made  all Member States must vigorously support and abide by them. Last month  at the London Conference on the former Yugoslavia  I made it clear that Canada is losing patience with much of the posturing that  historically  has masqueraded as international diplomacy. I know that others in the Assembly share this frustration. But  as we speak  the body count rises in what is left of Bosnia and Herzegovina not to mention the thousands of men  women and children who are facing starvation in Somalia. The United Nations needs the commitment of its Member States  it needs well-thought-out and timely decisions  and it needs follow-up action. Anything less is failure. Let us not spend the next four or five years debating the niceties of this principle or that concept; let us all get on with the everyday job of building peace and security. No one should be here who is not prepared to work towards those noble objectives  and no one should leave here without confirming his or her commitment to working together for the benefit of all the peoples of the world. "
"29",1266,"CHL",47,1992,"In our times  a unique advance has been made in the search for peace  understanding and cooperation among peoples. Mankind is progressively becoming more and more aware of this new reality. Accordingly  the present juncture is an appropriate one for reflection and dialogue within the framework of the United Nations  for a review of our achievements as well as of our shortcomings  and for a serious  in-depth study of the role we assign to the Organization and the hopes we seek to fulfil  hopefully in the near future. I wish to reiterate here the conviction of President Aylwin's Government regarding the moral  political and social imperative of placing the needs of people at the heart of United Nations activities. Reducing poverty. increasing employment and promoting social cohesion are needs shared by the entire international community. For these reasons  the importance of this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is inarguable. We welcome the new Member States that have joined the United Nations and that will take part with us in its endeavours. We welcome your election  Mr. President  since it will permit an experienced figure in world politics to guide our deliberations and lead them to an outcome which is satisfactory to all. At the same time we appreciate the judicious administration of your illustrious predecessor  Ambassador Shihabi.* The world is on the threshold of the twenty-first century. We have left behind us the senseless ideological confrontations between the super-Powers and the danger of nuclear holocaust. But there is no guarantee of peace. There are still old tensions and new ones the result of racism  religious fanaticism and extreme nationalism; there remains the historic challenge of development for all; and there is still a terrible social debt which cannot be rescheduled to the most disenfranchised members of all our societies. Our Organization is still faced with many challenges calling for more effective action. The war in Bosnia and the grave reports of massive violations of human rights  reaching the point of genocide  in the territories devastated by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia demand concerted and vigorous action. The auspicious but still uncertain process launched in South Africa poses new challenges for our Organization. The ongoing negotiations on the Middle East augur well for the future  but other situations in the world still pose a threat to peace. Social confrontation  the outcome of the growing gap between well-being and poverty  has become a source of global instability. Today more than ever  development with equity is the new requirement for peace  a common task we are called upon to join together and undertake. Now that the cold war is over  the role of the United Nations has taken on more relevance than ever before. The Organization has a central role to play in building a new international order which will make it possible to face the crises that constitute serious threats to peace in many parts of the world. These crises  and a whole series of economic  social and environmental challenges  can be overcome only if the Organization is strengthened  commands more respect and becomes more efficient in the pursuit of its lofty goals. Of course  it is essential that this enormous task we are calling on the world Organization to perform be complemented by the preventive activities carried out by regional organizations. Our own regional organization  the Organization of American States  is carrying out that mission by engaging in a realistic and tenacious effort to forestall or resolve the region's varied and difficult problems. But it is in the United Nations that we must develop the concepts  principles and agreements which will make the security of individuals a priority objective of international cooperation. This  in turn  will enhance coexistence among States. We must search together for new political directions that allow us to strengthen the role of the Organization in the maintenance of peace and security  in the defence of human rights  in the protection of the environment  in the struggle against drug trafficking and terrorism and in closing the gap between North and South. The starting-point must be the values that inspire our action. Chile proclaims before this worldwide forum its unswerving dedication to peace and respect for the dignity of the individual  its conviction that justice is the foundation of any truly stable society  its belief in the universal value of human rights  its respect for individual creativity and democracy as an ideal form of government its commitment  in short  to the needs of the most humble in all our societies and its recognition of the validity of law and of the search for consensus as a foundation for major national and international agreements. Chile firmly believes in the Charter of the United Nations. There is no substitute for this Organization as a world parliament  as a forum for international debates and agreements  as a source of innovative technical analysis and as a multilateral body responsible for peace  security and development. Just as we back the role of the United Nations without reservation  we likewise set no limits on our demand that it should be efficient and democratic in the attainment of its objectives. Certainly  that depends on the will of Governments  as well as on the strengthening of the competence and autonomy of the Secretariat. Above all  a balance needs to be struck between the General Assembly as the principal political organ  the Security Council as the organ responsible for dealing with the traditional problems of peace and security  and the Economic and Social Council as the primary body for promoting sustainable and equitable development. Mutually respectful interaction among these three levels should permit the United Nations to take the lead in creating an international order of peace in which the interests and problems of all countries are adequately represented. In this new world order which is taking shape and which all members of the Organization must contribute to designing  a vitally important place is occupied by the Secretary-General's report  entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  which contains ideas and suggestions regarding preventive diplomacy and peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-building. Chile agrees that the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security should be strengthened. While preventive diplomacy is playing an increasingly significant role on the international scene  the concept of peace-building  in the sense of creating a new climate and strengthening security through economic  social and cultural development  is a fundamental issue. Our country is collaborating with the United Nations and is prepared to increase its participation in the future  should that prove necessary. Chile's readiness in this regard has been expressed in its support for the Security Council in the decisions that have been adopted. Likewise  it has in recent years placed at the service of the United Nations the knowledge and professional experience of its armed forces and forces of public order. Chilean soldiers have traditionally been among the members of the United Nations observer forces in the Middle East and the Asian subcontinent. Our marines are initiating their activities in Cambodia  our pilots have been active in Kuwait  and our police are collaborating with the peace force in El Salvador. In this spirit of service to the cause of peace  Chile is a constant participant in the debates in multilateral forums on disarmament on a global scale  without prejudice to our active involvement on the regional level. We support the Convention on chemical weapons and reiterate our legitimate desire to become a full member of the Conference on Disarmament once the issue of its enlargement becomes the subject of real discussion. In the regional sphere  we see as important the initiative we have taken  together with Argentina and Brazil  that is designed to give full effect to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean through a set of amendments intended to strengthen its monitoring system and which the conference of signatories has approved by acclamation. In the context of the positive spirit that has succeeded the cold-war period and is characterized by the search for agreements and a climate of friendship and collaboration between the Powers  my country considers that the time has come to undertake  on a carefully thought-out time scale  the total elimination of nuclear weapons  and to put a definitive end right now to the testing of such weapons. I join my voice with those of the Ministers of the Nordic Group who  meeting at Svalbard  welcome the efforts being made  particularly the halting of the French tests in the Pacific  and expressed their wish that the voluntary moratorium on all nuclear explosions should become a permanent one  removing from the world once and for all these practices which threaten our security  coexistence and environment. In the years to come  we shall have to take up the issue of the composition of the Security Council. We believe that this important body should reflect new international realities  and we are accordingly ready to consider with interest and sympathy new formulas that would appropriately reflect the aspirations of new world Powers which are seeking to become regular members of the Council. It is also essential to strengthen the presence in that body of the various developing regions. Inevitably  this will entail greater participation numerically  as well as new forms of regional representation. With improvements over time  this practice could become a mechanism for representation of the regional groups which would combine freedom of action for the country elected with the expression of the will of the countries of its region. This system  if effectively operated  could ensure that all Members of the Organization feel that they are participating to the proper extent in the decisions of the Security Council. Chile is also interested in strengthening the Economic and Social Council. According to the Charter of the United Nations  this is the principal specialized body of the system for analysing in an integrated way the political  technical and operational dimensions of current economic and social problems. The Council should be strengthened and renewed in order to become a true council for development  capable of guiding high-level dialogue  formulating development policies and providing proper guidance for the operational activities of the system. We shall be participating actively in discussions under way on these issues on the basis of the interesting proposals submitted by the Nordic countries and the Group of 77  and of the resolutions of the most recent session of the Council. A factor that will contribute to the reform of the"" Economic and Social Council will be the establishment  under it  of the commission for sustainable development  which is called upon to become the body for monitoring environment. problems. The link between the commission on sustainable development and the world environment fund is also the key to the success of Agenda 21  the ambitious programme of action approved by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. The practical results of the Conference  which were characterized by the great effort made to reach agreement  are being carefully watched by the public at large  which is participating in ever-greater numbers in this process. The signing of the Conventions on biological diversity and climate change  the convening of the world conferences on desertification a subject of great interest to many countries  but of vital importance to the African nations and the conference on fishing on the high seas are milestones in the international effort to preserve the environment. We cannot enter a new era of world peace although it is potentially within our grasp if we forget the human being. In the final analysis  our capacity to lead and the raison d'√™tre of the United Nations will be measured by the success we achieve in the field of social development. Without greater well-being for all our citizens  there will be no peace  security or lasting stability at either the national or the international level. That is why we put forward the initiative for a world summit for social development. This proposal was recently endorsed unanimously in the Economic and Social Council  which approved a positive recommendation to the General Assembly that it convene the summit at the beginning of 1995 at the level of Heads of State and Heads of Government. I should like to take this occasion to thank all the Member States which participated in that consensus  and in particular the 121 countries that sponsored the relevant resolution. I should also like to thank the Secretary-General for having assigned to our representative to the United Nations  Ambassador Juan Somavia  the task of bringing to a successful conclusion the consultations required to put this initiative into effect. The first step has now been taken. Much remains to be done. There is no doubt that the primary responsibility for resolving this situation is borne at the domestic level. Each country must take steps to stabilize the functioning of its political system  encourage investment  trade and technological development and ensure equitable distribution of income. Chile has accepted that challenge. It is growing today at an annual rate of 7 per cent and has reduced unemployment to about 5 per cent and inflation to 13 per cent a year. In addition  under President Aylwin's Government  the process of solving the problem of external debt has been concluded  the real income of salaried workers has increased by 15 per cent and policies designed to alleviate the poverty of the most disenfranchised sectors of the population have been implemented. This has been done on the basis of an open economy which has concentrated on both economic and social efficiency against a background of personal freedom and political democracy. Although the success of these programmes has been recognized by the various sectors in our national life  we are aware that much more still needs to be done with our resources. But we are equally aware that the benefits for our country would be significantly greater if the ground rules of the international economy were more equitable. Even while most of the world is calling  with growing clarity and force  for the abolition of protectionism and the formulation of stable and non-discriminatory rules to govern international trade  unilateral measures are reversing this world-wide trend and giving rise to direct forms of protectionism in the main world markets  in a departure from the principles and regulatory framework established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I now wish to say a few words on the Secretariat. First  we welcome the election of the distinguished scholar  diplomat and politician Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-General. The Members of the United Nations are witnesses to Chile's consistent support for the African continent's aspiration to see one of its own in that high post. We have already expressed our opinion publicly at the bilateral level  within the Non-Aligned Movement and in the General Assembly last year. We already have evidence of the Secretary-General's character and decision-making ability. We support him in his task. The Secretariat is of course a vital organ under the Charter and in the United Nations system. In order to meet the challenges that lie ahead  it must act with the maximum efficiency and autonomy. The Secretariat is at the service of all countries  and accordingly all of them must be properly represented at its various levels. The efficiency of the Organization depends to a large extent on the confidence Governments have in the technical ability  experience and impartiality of its staff. At a time when we are asking the Organization to perform all the tasks that arise in this era  its constant financial insecurity is absurd. It is essential to enhance the fluidity and automaticity of countries' payment of their assessments. This is doubtless a responsibility that is shared by all  but to the greatest extent by the main contributors. We cannot have a strong Organization with a weak financial base. The specialized agencies and regional commissions are called upon to continue playing a vital role in such fields as cooperation for development  protection of the environment and economic and social analysis. The contributions they have made  to the benefit above all of the developing world  must be assessed at their true value.* The support of the United Nations for the second Space Conference of the Americas  to be held shortly in Santiago  is another example that regional and global efforts are complementary. Chile has long had the privilege of being the site of important regional offices of the world Organization. Their presence in our country is proof of Chile's commitment to the activities of the United Nations  which we shall always be prepared to support. The subject of the United Nations  which is certainly what has brought us together  is an exciting one for the international community. Indeed  fulfilment of the purposes and principles of its Charter has been a constant concern of our country. Likewise  failure to respect them arouses a sense of frustration. The duties and rights of each Member State vis-a-vis the Organization can in no way be reduced to a matter of legalities or to simple mechanical action. We recognize a real commitment to the United Nations system  and consequently we discharge each of our duties responsibly. The nations assembled here and indeed the world have before them the best possible opportunity of firmly guaranteeing the future of coming generations  a substantial improvement in the quality of life  the elimination of the development gap and the attainment of peace in short  the opportunity of building a better world for all and with all. Let us all take up that challenge. "
"30",1312,"CHN",47,1992,"May I begin by warmly congratulating you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. I believe that  given your talent and experience  you will guide this session to a successful completion of the noble mission entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations. I would also like to express my appreciation and thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Shihabi  for the contribution he made to accomplishing the tasks of the last session. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm welcome and congratulations to the 13 States that have been admitted to the United Nations this year: the Republic of Armenia  the Azerbaijani Republic  the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  the Republic of Croatia  the Republic of Georgia  the Republic of Kazakhstan  the Republic of Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  the Republic of San Marino  the Republic of Slovenia  the Republic of Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  and the Republic of Uzbekistan. Since the last session of the General Assembly  profound changes have taken place in the world  with events of major consequences occurring one after another  from East to West and North to South. The international community has finally shaken off the old pattern whose main feature was the confrontation between the two military blocs. The world has now entered a new historical phase of development towards multipolarity. We in China have a saying: ""Past experience can serve as a guide for the present"". The tortuous course that mankind has traversed in this century  particularly since the end of the Second World War  has revealed a historical truth: any Power  however strong it may be  is bound to decline if it goes against the people's will for peace and development. It has always been a shared aspiration and objective of the people of all countries to work for world peace  national stability  social progress  economic growth and a better life. This is a historical trend which no force can resist. The genuine peace that the people of the world have longed for has not come with the end of the cold war. On the contrary  the world remains uneasy  with new problems added to the old ones and armed conflicts erupting one after another as a result of disrupted equilibrium. Hegemonism and power politics continue to exist. The attempt of some big Powers to control developing countries politically and economically has become more and more obvious. Long-hidden ethnic conflicts have surfaced with a vengeance and the North-South contradictions have further intensified. The road to peace and development before the people of the world is covered with thorns. As we can all see  a dangerous ""seismic belt"" extending from the Balkans to the Caucasus and to Central Asia is taking shape. In some regions  people have once again been plunged into war and turmoil  with millions of refugees fleeing in all directions. These conflicts have occurred in those areas where different ethnic groups have traditionally lived together  with age-old antagonisms suddenly coming to the surface under the new situation. These conflicts are interwoven with historical feuds  territorial disputes  political rivalries  clashes of economic interests  and religious intolerance. They have been further complicated by the involvement of outside forces. In our view  force should not be used even as a last resort in the search of the settlement of a problem  however complicated it may be. The fundamental solution lies in a reconciliation of various ethnic groups through dialogues on an equal footing and peaceful negotiations. We sincerely hope that the parties' to the conflicts will  proceeding from the overriding interest of maintaining the peace and in the interests of the people  abandon the threat or use of force and seek a political settlement of their conflicts through friendly consultations and negotiations on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual respect  good-neighbourliness and common progress. We support the United Nations in its positive efforts to avoid an escalation of conflicts and seek peaceful settlements. Outside intervention and mediation can be resorted to when necessary  provided that they are based on a strict observance of the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter and the basic norms of international law. Only mediation or intervention in such a manner can contribute to a peaceful settlement of conflicts  the stability and unity of sovereign States  and the amicable coexistence of different ethnic groups. The Middle East peace process has taken a favourable turn thanks to the joint efforts of the Arab countries and Israel and the support of the rest of the international community. We hope that the parties concerned will seize the opportunity  take a flexible and practical approach  and conduct serious negotiations in order to remove obstacles and seek a comprehensive and fair solution to the Middle East issue  including the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people on the basis of the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed political stability and a sustained economic growth. In Cambodia  the striving for peace and rehabilitation has become the order of the day. Political settlement of the Cambodian issue is irreversible  though difficulties and twists and turns are hardly avoidable. The implementation of the Paris Agreements in their totality requires not only determination but also patience. In Afghanistan  the resistance forces have taken control. We hope they will end the bloodshed so as to create suitable conditions for the election. On the Korean peninsula  the North and the South have intensified their dialogue  resulting in a further relaxation of tension there. The recent establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Republic of Korea will have a far-reaching impact on stability and peace in North-East Asia. The turbulent and complicated international situation has further awakened countries and peoples of the world to the urgency and necessity of establishing a new international order. The world of the future should not be a place where only the interests and privileges of big Powers or power groups are protected  nor a place where international affairs are monopolized and manipulated by the big  strong  and wealthy countries only. The old world order based on unequal relationships no longer works. A new international order should be based on the universal observance of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  mutual non-aggression  non-interference in each other's internal affairs  equality and mutual benefit  and peaceful coexistence. This is in conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. All countries  big or small  strong or weak  rich or poor  should have the right to choose a social system and a road to development suited to their actual conditions. Countries should respect each other  treat each other as equals  and resolve their disputes through peaceful negotiations. Only when all countries undertake to observe these principles can there be genuine democracy in international relations. We are convinced that as the world moves towards multipolarity  an equitable and rational international order of peace and stability will come into being. The United States and the former Soviet Union or Russia have reached some new agreements on nuclear-arms reduction in recent years. These agreements have been well-received by the international community  which hopes that they will be earnestly implemented by the countries concerned. At the same time  it is clear to people that even after the aforementioned disarmament agreements are fully implemented  the major military Powers will still be in possession of the largest arsenals of the most sophisticated nuclear and other high-tech weapons  and the capabilities to develop space weapons. After years of negotiations  the chemical weapons convention has finally been concluded. It has laid an international legal basis for a world-wide elimination of such weapons of mass destruction. Though some of its provisions are not fair and balanced  the purposes and objectives defined in the convention have nonetheless won the unanimous endorsement and support of the international community. We hope that these purposes and objectives will be observed and carried out effectively in the interest of the security of all countries. China has all along stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of all weapons of mass destruction. Pending the realization of this goal  it is necessary for the international community to take  as a transitional step  appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the interest of regional and world security and stability. We maintain that international non-proliferation should be pursued in a fair  reasonable  comprehensive and balanced manner without prejudice to the legitimate security interests of any country  to its socio-economic development  or to international cooperation in the application of science and technology for peaceful purposes. We oppose the attempt of a country to interfere in and obstruct the normal cooperation between sovereign States under the pretext of preventing arms proliferation. We strongly condemn the blatant violation of one's own commitment to an international agreement by selling large amounts of advanced weapons and equipment  in gross interference in another country's internal affairs. We would like to make the following suggestions in the field of disarmament and arms control. First  all nuclear-weapon States should undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons or to resort to the threat or use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States in any circumstances whatsoever. Secondly  all nuclear-weapon States should support proposals for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones  respect the status of the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones  and undertake corresponding obligations. Those countries which have deployed nuclear weapons abroad should withdraw all of them to their own territories. Thirdly  all countries with space capabilities should follow the principle of the peaceful use of space and immediately stop their research  testing  production  and deployment of space weapons and refrain from extending their weapons systems into space. In today's world  the gulf between the rich and the poor is further widening. The population of the richest countries and that of the poorest countries each accounts for 20 per cent of the world's total  but their income gap has grown wider  from 30-fold in the 1960s to 90-fold in the 1990s. The question of North-South relations has become more acute. Development and peace are matters of equal urgency and importance. The sluggish growth of the world economy  unequal and unfair trade  the plummeting prices of many primary products and crushing debt burdens are among the unfavourable external conditions which have continued to place severe constraints on the economic development of developing countries. Quite a few of them have suffered a constant drop in the growth rate of their per capita gross national product (GNP). Some have even registered negative economic growth rates. Their terms of trade continue to deteriorate  which hampers their export efforts. They have found it even more difficult to attract foreign investment and technology. Peace and development are mutually supportive. They can promote or hinder each other  but they cannot supersede each other. It is impossible to preserve world peace without development. There can hardly be durable stability and prosperity in the world in the absence of economic development and social progress in developing countries. A protracted economic stagnation or even decline in developing countries will also affect further economic growth in developed countries. Developing countries should mainly rely on themselves to achieve real economic growth. While restructuring their economies to speed up their economic development  many of them are reviewing their experience and earnestly exploring paths of development suited to their national conditions. No one can deny that the old international economic order  being irrational and inequitable  is an important external cause of the poverty and backwardness of developing countries. First and foremost  developed countries have the responsibility and obligation to take effective measures  including the following. First  developed countries should set aside 0.7 per cent of their GNP for assistance to developing countries in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations; increase official development assistance  and address the debt question and work to rectify the anomaly of the flight of capital from developing to developed countries. Secondly  they should observe the basic principles of the generalized system of preferences devised by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development; dismantle discriminatory trade barriers; further open their markets to developing countries; and endeavour to keep the prices of primary products at rational levels. Thirdly  they should resume and increase official and non-governmental technical assistance and the concessional transfer of technology to developing countries in order gradually to narrow the North-South gap in science and technology and to facilitate the economic restructuring and technological progress of developing countries. It must be stressed that political stability is an important prerequisite for the economic growth of developing countries. Assistance for the purpose of applying pressure on the recipient countries will cause turbulence and instability in these countries  which will be even more detrimental to their economic development. It is obviously one-sided and harmful to make irresponsible comments about the human rights situation in developing countries in disregard of the differences in 'historical backgrounds and cultural traditions as well as the actual conditions in these countries. For the people of developing countries  the right to subsistence and the right to development are undoubtedly the fundamental and the most important human rights of all. In those areas hit by severe natural disasters year after year  people are starving; in war-ridden areas  millions are turned into refugees. How can people living in such conditions enjoy human rights? Establishing an equitable and rational new international economic order based on equality and mutual benefit will be a reliable guarantee of balanced  healthy and sustained growth in the world economy  and an important precondition for gradually narrowing the North-South gap as well. The achievement of this goal calls for serious dialogue between the North and the South and joint efforts by both. As long as the two sides adopt a positive approach  seek common ground on major issues while putting aside minor differences  seek mutual benefit and actively look for ways to cooperate effectively  the North-South dialogue will make headway. The important documents adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and the Conventions on climate change and biological diversity open for signature during the Conference reflect the consensus and understanding that countries at different stages of development have reached on environmental protection and economic development. We hope that the obligations and rights in respect of environmental protection will be fulfilled or exercised fully  and that global cooperation in this field will provide scope for improved North-South relations. The Chinese Government actively supports the proposals for a World Summit for Social Development  under United Nations auspices. It warmly welcomes the convocation of the fourth World Conference on Women  to be held in Beijing in September 1995. The Chinese organization committee was set up in August this year  and China will begin preparing in earnest to ensure that arrangements for the conference in Beijing run smoothly. The historic changes in the international situation have also presented formidable challenges to the United Nations. The people of the world have high expectations of this world Organization. How the United Nations will adapt itself to the new international situation  address major international issues in a more positive  balanced  just and reasonable manner  promote world peace and development and play its role in the efforts to establish a new world order has become a major concern of the international community. The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has submitted a detailed and extensive mid-year report (A/47/277) on the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace  which merits our careful study. We appreciate his efforts. The reform of the United Nations is now on the agenda  and its success depends on sound principles and on choosing the right direction. We should like to offer for consideration the following thoughts  which we think conform to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The reform should contribute to maintaining the sovereignty of Member States. Sovereign States are the subjects of international law and form the basis of the United Nations. Safeguarding State sovereignty should be a fundamental principle of a new world order. The reform should facilitate the peaceful settlement of international conflicts. The United Nations should be an international organization dedicated to preserving peace and promoting cooperation. Only when it abides by the basic norms governing international relations  persists in settling all international disputes through peaceful means and opposes the threat or use of force will the United Nations be able to maintain international peace and security. The arbitrary use of military intervention by the United Nations or the indiscriminate and wilful imposition of mandatory measures on Member States would not be helpful to the resolution of conflicts  and  worse still  would impair the credibility and role of the United Nations. The reform should contribute to the balanced  healthy and sustained economic development of countries. Economic development is a major concern of the vast majority of the 179 States Members of the United Nations. In today's world  the North-South economic gap keeps widening  and the gulf between rich and poor is getting greater. The United Nations should attach great importance to the question of development  as it does to the settlement of international conflicts and crises. Only by so doing can it win support from the overwhelming majority of Member States. The reform should embody the basic principles of democracy  justice  objectivity  rationality  efficiency and balance of interests. It is not a matter that concerns solely a few big Powers  nor only the strong and the rich. The balanced approach should not be discarded in disregard of the reality. The reform should serve the general objective of establishing an equitable and rational new world order of peace and stability. The reform efforts will not receive understanding and support from Member States unless their opinions on this matter are earnestly sought and discussed  and studied fully and thoroughly. From 1981 to 1990 China's GNP grew at an average annual rate of 8.9 per cent. In the 1980s significant changes took place in China. We enjoy political stability  economic prosperity  national unity and harmony. The Chinese people are enjoying their lives and work. Since the beginning of the 1990s people in China have been working hard to accelerate economic development and the reform and opening-up programme. Spurred by Deng Xiaoping's remarks at the beginning of the year  this programme and economic development have entered a new phase. The GNP growth rate this year is projected to reach and even exceed 9 per cent. China's economy has great vitality and its prospects are bright. China has expanded its open areas. As a result  a new pattern of general opening up has gradually taken shape  extending from coastal to border areas  from areas along the Yangtze river to the provincial capitals. China has further expanded the scale on which it can absorb foreign investment. In the first half of this year contracted foreign investment reached $14.6 billion  2.2 times what it was in the same period last year. During the same period China's imports and exports reached $33.06 billion and $35.61 billion respectively  up 23.4 per cent and 17.3 per cent over the same period last year. The total volume of foreign trade for the year is expected to exceed $150 billion. China's reform and opening-up programme is by no means a matter of expediency; rather  it is a long-term strategy  for it conforms to the popular will and benefits the people. Therefore  it enjoys their support and is bound to succeed. China is a force working steadfastly for world peace; its political stability and the success of its reform and opening up will contribute significantly to peace and development in Asia and the world at large. China will  as always  support the United Nations in its constructive efforts to promote peace and development. It will  together with the Governments and peoples of other countries  work for the establishment of a new world order conducive to world peace and common development. "
"31",1347,"CIV",47,1992,"We grieved to learn of the aviation disaster yesterday in Lagos  which caused the death of 163 members of the Nigerian military. On this sad occasion I should like to convey to the people and the Government of Nigeria our most sincere condolences. First Sir  on behalf of the delegation of Cote d'Ivoire I congratulate you on your election as President of the current session of the General Assembly. The confidence expressed in you by the Assembly is recognition both of you personally and your professionalism and of the important role played by your country in the achievement of the noble objectives of our Organization. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  who discharged his responsibilities as President of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly with such talent and dignity. Finally  I should not forget our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to whom I should like to address our most sincere congratulations on the vitality and ability he has demonstrated in the management of our Organization. His report  which provides an exhaustive view of the activities of the Organization  enables us to take up our debate with specific  current information. We most warmly welcome all those States that have just joined the Organization  thus highlighting its universality. Events in recent years have caused serious upheavals in international relations. The division of the world into two rival blocs is a thing of the past. The trend towards negotiation and emerging cooperation is the prelude to a new world order that has yet to take shape. Situations and certainties  which had in the past seemed immutable are changing  slowly but surely. We are currently witnessing political  economic  social and cultural transformations. We hope these developments  which seem to augur new international relations  will make it possible to meet the challenges of today. The have-nots of the world greeted with great hope the end of the cold war  and with the end of the arms race looked to the future sure that the world was moving towards peace  justice and solidarity. Unfortunately  while solidarity should have been strengthened  selfishness and the defence of short-term interests have intensified  to the detriment of cooperation for the mutual benefit of the various partners in international relations. Today the developed countries and the major economic  monetary and financial institutions have found it necessary to link their assistance to the establishment of what they consider to be democracy in the recipient countries  for which it is now a matter of linking the grant of external financial resources not merely to an economic reform programme based on the rules of the market  but also to respect for political pluralism. Regrettably  on the world scale  there is no longer a strategic or economic alternative that might counter this approach. If democracy is taken to mean more justice and increased popular participation in the management of a country's affairs  the Ivorian Government can be proud of its record. Indeed  the first version of the Constitution of Cote d'Ivoire  which has been in effect since independence  provides for a multiparty system  in its articles 6 and 7. In Cote d'Ivoire  the idea of democracy has always been part and parcel of the political process. Democracy and human rights have no borders. They are universal values  which should nevertheless have national roots. They cannot be imported  sold or bought  neither can they be imposed from outside. In international terms  this democratic process should logically entail greater involvement by States  be they large  small or medium-sized  in the consideration and solving of international problems of common interest. Therefore  it is not enough that the United Nations should become more universal merely within the General Assembly. This trend must also be reflected in the other principal organs if the Organization's democratic nature is to be enhanced. In spite of the progress achieved in various fields  an overview of the map of the world indicates that the international landscape is still covered by large grey areas of real and potential conflict. The stability of States is shaken by violent religious  social  cultural and linguistic struggles  as well as by unusually grave economic problems. The countries of the South in general  and African countries in particular  with their scores of refugees  are still prey to conflicts that seriously jeopardize the peace and security that are essential for their development. In South Africa  while we welcome the considerable progress achieved in dismantling apartheid  we are saddened by the escalation of violence. In this regard  we must appeal most urgently to all our South African brothers to put an end to the violence  massacres and abuses of all types that continue to cast a pall over the country and further to complicate the already difficult and complex task of those who are striving to build in South Africa a democratic  non-racial system through dialogue and negotiation. We welcome the forthcoming meeting between Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. Frederik de Klerk  and we hope that the negotiations under way will lead to a resumption of the negotiations within the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. Elsewhere in Africa internal conflicts with tragic consequences are still causing upheavals in Somalia  Rwanda and Liberia  to name but a few countries. With regard to a country on our borders Liberia the Committee of Five  chaired by President Houphouet-Boigny and set up by the fourteenth session of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  held in Abuja on 6 July 1991  met four times in Yamoussoukro and once in Geneva  in April 1992. The agreement that emerged from these many meetings  commonly called the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement  was endorsed by summit meetings of ECOWAS  the Organization of African Unity and the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as the best framework for finding a just and lasting solution to the Liberian crisis. Nevertheless  military aspects of the implementation of the Agreement have caused difficulties  with regard to the billeting and disarming of the belligerents  essential steps for the holding of free  fair and democratic elections. The appearance of a new faction  the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO)  on the scene of the Liberian conflict  has created a new situation of insecurity  increasing the existing distrust between the parties to the conflict. We hope that the new consultations under way  initiated by the President of ECOWAS and the Chairman of the Committee of the Five  will make possible reconsideration of the problems of Liberia as a whole in order more effectively to focus on the factors that will enable all the armed factions to apply in good faith the provisions of the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement. We urgently appeal to all Liberians to go a step further and to begin a constructive dialogue that alone can effectively help the international community to enable them to find a lasting solution to their problems and to the future of their country. For his part. President Houphouet-Boigny  who has been working tirelessly for peace in Africa and throughout the world  will fully support the process begun in order to solve the Liberian crisis so that the fraternal people of Liberia  to which we are linked by so many bonds  might finally have peace. In Angola  after 14 years of liberation struggle against the colonizing Power followed by 16 years of fratricidal struggle. Cote d'Ivoire commends the signing of the peace agreements which occurred in Lisbon in May 1991. Cote d'Ivoire most earnestly hopes that the multipartite elections that are to be held on 29 and 30 September will take place under the best possible circumstances so as to enable the fraternal people of Angola freely to choose their officials and fully to concentrate on the enormous task of reconstruction and development that lies ahead. In the Middle East  the Israeli-Arab conflict remains a major and constant source of concern despite the new peace initiatives that emerged from the historic Madrid meeting. Hope  however  has been renewed owing to the recent negotiations during which we noted with satisfaction an encouraging attitude on the part of the parties to the conflict  which seem determined to move forward with the peace process. The situation in the Persian Gulf still remains alarming  and the possibility of the conflict resuming cannot be ruled out. Hence we shall continue fully to support  as we did last year during our mandate in the Security Council  the complete implementation of all resolutions linked to the Gulf Crisis  especially Security Council resolution 687 (1991)  of 3 April 1991  which lays down the conditions for a permanent cease-fire in the Gulf governing post-war relations between Iraq and Kuwait. Furthermore  the quest for increased stability in some States is accompanied by the troubling phenomenon of sometimes violent disintegration in other States  in Europe and in various areas of the developing world. The situation in the Balkans and the tragedy of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are a perfect illustration of this. Confronted with these various situations  we must seek a new approach to settling conflicts. Quite rightly  we are now stressing once again the need for preventive diplomacy  which would have the effect of identifying areas of potential conflict and stemming crises before they degenerate into armed confrontation. That is why my country. Cote d'Ivoire  supports the report of the Secretary-General on strengthening the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. This report has the same objective as that of the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  that is  to create mechanisms for the prevention  management and settlement of conflicts  the principle of which was adopted during the twenty-eighth regular session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the OAU  which met in Dakar last July. The concerns and the worries that we reiterated last year from this very rostrum  which pertained to signs of a slowdown in world economic activity  have unfortunately become reality  to the extent that we have seen a real decline in the growth rate of global production of the world economy in 1991  accompanied by a concomitant drop in the volume of world trade. In this regard  we should emphasize the substantial drop in the growth level of imports of industrialized countries  the major export markets for raw materials produced by developing countries. The impact of such a situation on African countries has been catastrophic  since the recession in the industrialized countries has not only kept raw-materials prices at very low levels  but has also had the consequence of reducing the quantities exported  thereby causing a very substantial drop in the export earnings of African countries. Nevertheless  in spite of the unfavourable economic environment  African countries including my own. Cote d'Ivoire  in particular have courageously continued to pursue efforts undertaken as part of the structural adjustment process and drastic economic reform  with all that this entails in terms of the risk of social unrest. As regards my country  those measures have none the less allowed for the establishment of macro-economic balances  which means that we might achieve a 5 per cent growth rate by 1995. However  in order to reduce as soon as possible the social cost of structural adjustment measures  we must resume the still-unfinished debate on North-South relations between rich and poor countries  between industrialized countries and those that do not have the means of paying their debts nor of relaunching their stricken economies. In this regard  we should  in the financial sphere  come up with a final solution to external debt problems that takes into account debtor countries' actual repayment abilities. This restructuring of external debt should be supplemented by the granting of substantial financial assistance  on concessional terms  as was the case with Eastern Europe. While we are asking developing countries to make ever-greater efforts and sacrifices  we see from the analysis of recent statements by International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank heads  Messrs. Michel Camdessus and Lewis Preston  that rich countries are the ones setting a bad example in managing the world economy. These countries  they say  are not conforming to any budgetary discipline  which ends up costing developing countries dearly. Those officials also pointed out that only 5 of the 20 richest countries in the world have devoted 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance  in accordance with the objectives set by the United Nations. Even the International Development Association (IDA) today appears to be imperilled in that it is not sure that it will be able to obtain the $18 billion considered absolutely necessary for its functioning. Contrary to this trend  we welcome Japan's decision to hold  in 1993  a conference on development in Africa. As President Houphouet-Boigny has often said: ""The real problem of Africa today is above all economic and financial"". He also stated  recently at the OAU Summit in Dakar  that the only difference between developed and developing countries is that the former have the technological capacity to process our raw materials into finished products for their own consumption and to use any surplus for export  while the latter can only export their raw materials  be they agricultural  mining or mineral products. Such a situation must change  and to this end  the assistance and cooperation of our northern partners should no longer restrict us indefinitely to the role of providers of raw materials but rather enable us  thanks to the processing of part or all of our raw materials  to also become consumer countries. But pending this development  which should not be delayed  we producers of raw materials  be they agricultural  mining or mineral products  fervently hope that the markets for the majority of our commodities will be organized  within the framework of appropriate international agreements that would take into account the best interests of both consumers and producers. That is why I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to appeal most earnestly to the States members of the European Economic Community (EEC)  whose constant support for developing countries has been unfailing  to take determined action  individually and collectively  in order to foster the forthcoming conclusion of new international agreements  particularly those relating to coffee and cocoa  negotiations on which are currently under way.  This is also the place to affirm that  contrary to commonly-held views  we remain convinced  as far as we are concerned  of the ability of well-written international agreements on commodities to stabilize markets and thereby to foster the economic growth of countries that produce raw materials. Indeed  taking into account the overall importance of raw materials in the economies of developing countries  and in particular the extreme dependence of some of them on a single product or small number of products from which they draw their main source of revenue  we think it perfectly logical to acknowledge that these markets should be organized in such a way that  while guaranteeing regular supply for industries using these products  the prices remain stable so as not only to allow for decent earnings for the processing industries but also to ensure remunerative prices and predictable earnings for producer countries. Furthermore  mutatis mutandis  such thinking underlay the idea of the common agricultural policy of the European Economic Community (EEC)  the major aim of which was to ensure the security of food supplies within the boundaries of the community at prices that were reasonable for the consumer and both stable and remunerative for the rural population. Indeed  no country in the world can remain indifferent to the drop in income of its peasants. The United States of America and the member States of the EEC have understood this so well that they spare no subsidy in helping their farmers keep their purchasing power on a par with their efforts. It is therefore difficult for us to understand why the same machinery that has functioned so well internally and regionally in the Western countries cannot be usefully adapted internationally within the framework of raw materials in the relationship between North and South. Taking all this into consideration  it is perfectly obvious that only the conclusion of international agreements aimed at promoting stability in the rates of raw materials at remunerative prices would foster the implementation of production policies guaranteeing the preservation of the environment. In this context  it is good that the Rio Conference emphasized the close link that exists between the deterioration of the environment  indebtedness  and the deterioration in the terms of trade. Indeed  Cote d'Ivoire  like many other countries  has had to intensify the exploitation of its natural resources in order to honour its international financial obligations. This situation is not in the interests of sustainable development. For that  as agreed in Rio  the industrialized countries must  as a matter of urgency  take the necessary steps to help in the transition of our economies towards sustainable development  especially in implementing decisions aimed at the elimination of obstacles in the trade of raw or processed goods and the transfer of new and additional financial resources to developing countries. In this regard. Agenda 21 has highlighted several ways to achieve the objectives with regard to the transfer of resources through the following machinery: through the special increase of resources in the form of the ""Earth Increment"" in the World Bank; through the global environmental facility that will meet next December in Abidjan and whose objective is to increase its resources from $1.1 billion to $4.5 billion; and through debt alleviation  especially for middle-income countries. It is also worth noting that in Rio  several countries promised to increase their transfer of resources to developing countries  committing themselves to achieve 1 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance by the year 2000. Some of them have announced special contributions. By way of example  I cite the EEC  which hopes to reach  $4 billion  and Japan  which hopes to reach $8 billion in three years. We can only express our sincere gratitude for these fortunate initiatives  just as we commend those countries that have committed themselves to making contributions during the current session of the General Assembly. Our hopes are placed in the Commission on Sustainable Development that is to meet at the ministerial level; its work will be decisive in following up on the implementation of Agenda 21 programmes and their integration. In this context  and on behalf of my delegation  I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr. Maurice Strong for his magnificent work and to ask him to be kind enough to guide the first steps of the secretariat of that Commission  because in our view that is essential in order to guarantee the effective implementation and proficient and speedy follow-up of the commitments made in Rio. As regards the critical economic situation in Africa  we remain confident of the ability of the international community to mobilize itself in the effective support of the efforts of the African countries to realize the aims of the new United Nations agenda for the development of Africa for the 1990s adopted by the General Assembly in December 1991. The elements of this new agenda  dealing with the last decade of the twentieth century  constitute a major challenge that Africa must meet with success if it is not to be irredeemably marginalized at the dawn of the twenty-first century  so full of promise for humanity. That is why the African countries  aware of the importance of the current and future stakes  as well as of their primary responsibility in achieving growth and sustainable development  have firmly committed themselves to regional integration and to accelerating the democratization process of their internal institutions. That is why is it is important that conditions for growth and development in Africa be achieved as soon as possible  because they are quite obviously the sine qua non for the true and realistic exercise of the democracy that cements peace within African States  peace among African States  and peace between Africa and the rest of the world. As President Houphouet-Boigny often says: ""Peace and poverty make poor bedfellows."" That is why we exhort the international community to show more understanding for the question of remunerative prices for raw materials  upon which many developing countries depend  especially in Africa. Africa needs to be considered by the rest of the world as a partner rather than a burden. The partnership it seeks implies dignity rather than dependency  mutual interests rather than charity. The bipolar world that has held sway in the international order since 1945 has crumbled. Since the time of Alexander of Macedonia  great empires have arisen only to collapse in a process that has been broadly described by Professor Paul Kennedy in his Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. Every century brings its share of innovations and surprises. The twentieth century which is now drawing to a close has brought great changes to human existence. It has seen people invent all sorts of instruments to advance thought  to cure as well as to kill. Today's world seems to have found unity through a certain number of values  among which is the primacy of law in international relations. Such a development can only strengthen the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of peace. It is thus up to every State to support the activity of our Organization in order to enable it to carry out its difficult task effectively. My  country  which has always made a determined search for peace the cornerstone of its foreign policy  will not fail to make its contribution to the building of this noble enterprise and to the shaping of the new world order which is emerging and which  to be solid and lasting  must be linked to the search for a world of peace  justice  and shared well-being. "
"32",1392,"CMR",47,1992,"Mr. President  the contribution that your country  Bulgaria  is making to the building of a new world order accords with the genius of its people. He are gratified by your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session  and we wish you every success in the discharge of your mandate.He take pleasure in hailing and paying tribute to His Excellency Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  who skilfully handled his responsibilities at the forty-sixth session  which was marked by  among other major events  the election of the new Secretary-General of our Organization.He also take pleasure in addressing heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali. The energy and distinction with which he has assumed his new functions reinforce our conviction that he will succeed in lending the necessary impetus to the indispensable transformation that will enable the United Nations system to rise to the growing expectations of a world seeking peace  security and prosperity for all.His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar of Peru admirably strove towards the same ends during his remarkable term at the helm of our Organization. Cameroon offers him its profound thanks.Thirteen new States have just been admitted to the United Nations. This is a resounding victory of the inalienable right of peoples to decide for themselves  and we see it as a sign of the times:	the beginning of a new pagein the history of humankind.He therefore take pleasure in welcoming among us the representatives of Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  andUzbekistan.The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the international community is still trying to cope with the sweeping changes brought about by the end of the cold war. None the less  there is increasingly gaining ground a convergence of wills in confronting the new kinds of challenges that threaten our collective security  and in meeting old challenges such as poverty and want  whose continued existence in this new day and age seems like a negation of our shared humanity.The historic Security Council summit of 31 January 1992  the very first of its kind  provided a striking illustration of that point  reviving the hope that the collective responsibility of our Organization in the quest for solutions to global challenges will henceforth be based on more effective international solidarity.Cameroon thus agrees with the rest of the international community as to the need to revitalize the United Nations so as to increase its efficacy  its prestige and its authority to enable it to discharge the responsibilities conferred upon it by the Charter.The shared vision of the Member States as to the central role the Organization must henceforth play in the realm of international peace and security  as also in the equally vital area of development  implies the prerequisite that decisions be taken on the basis of consensus. That being so  the restructuring process now under way must neither tend towards side-lining certain States nor lead to redeployments based on selective priorities.In that context it is appropriate to welcome the pertinent study ""Agenda for peace"" submitted by the Secretary-General at the request of the Security Council. The bold proposals it embodies will  we are convinced  stimulate joint reflection on all the issues connected with peace  which are priority concerns of the international community. We share in the global vision that emerges from that study. The fact is that the problems of peace cannot be analyzed solely in terms of the prevention and management of conflicts  because peace and security are contingent upon factors that are at once socio-economic  political and military in nature.Therefore we welcome the latest spectacular strides taken in the arena of disarmament  as consolidated by the recent conclusion of work on the Convention on Chemical Weapons. But progress remains to be made in checking the risk of the proliferation of nuclear technology and coping with supply and demand in conventional weaponry.In fact  though it is certain that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction does contribute to strengthening international peace and security  the definition of a minimum threshold of weaponry necessary to ensure the security of States reassures the international community as to the desired achievement of general and complete disarmament.We might thus be able to build a lasting peace and release major resources for the building of a new world order that will be more equitable  marked by greater solidarity and oriented towards the advancement and fulfillment of all human beings.That is the rationale that fits the initiative taken by the member States of the Economic Community of Central Africa aimed at the implementation of measures likely 'to build confidence and enhance security and development in our subregion.Thus  in conformity with General Assembly resolution 46/37 B  adopted by consensus at the forty-sixth session  the Secretary-General has proclaimed the establishment of a standing advisory committee responsible for matters ofsecurity in Central Africa. Indeed  the 11 States of our subregion  having met at Yaounde from 27 to 31 July 1992 under the auspices of the United Nations  adopted that Committee's action program  which revolves around a set of measures notably involving establishing a center for training peace-keepers; entering into a non-aggression pact; and establishing an international headquarters and staff for crisis management.In this regard I wish on behalf of its promoters to express our appreciation to the Organization for the assistances that has been provided thus far in the implementation of confidence-building measures in Central Africa.He sincerely hope that the United Nations and individual Member States  and governmental and non-governmental organizations alike  will provide assistance to the Committee's action program.The elimination of poverty and underdevelopment must have priority among the present concerns of the international community. To that end  we have decided upon strategies and action programs to be implemented. The same is true of the Declaration that emanated from the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly  on international economic co-operation. The strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade is a part of this trend  as indeed are the conclusions reached at the recent United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development.Furthermore  I would observe that our countries have taken a certain number of steps in economic and political terms. Economically  they have undertaken painful reform in the context of structural adjustment  and  politically  they have set in place a process of democratization to ensure their people of advancement and more effective enjoyment of human rights.To meet with success  however  the efforts thus undertaken by developing countries must be accompanied by respect on the part of the developed countries for commitments undertaken so as to seal the new contract of worldwide solidarity in favor of development  a contract that expresses the convergent vision of the international community as to strategies and plans of action to be implemented.Against that background  the present international economic environment must  especially with regard to raw materials  stop being a jungle in which the ruthless law of speculation holds sway and contempt is shown for the legitimate demands of our countries for more equitable compensation for our commodities.Beyond that  it is high time to find a satisfactory solution to the debt problems  the weight of which is paralyzing our economies  in terms of debt-servicing leading to unsustainable investments of net financial flowstowards the rich countries and multinational institutions. In this respect/ I should like  in particular  to welcome the Rio resolution with regard to financial resources a resolution that extends the benefit of debt cancellation to medium-income countries. He hope that this major decision will be translated into action.It is hardly necessary to emphasize the extreme seriousness of the situation in Africa  where there is an unprecedented economic crisis  aggravated by natural disasters  civil wars and the social consequences of structural adjustment  which threaten the process of democratization. While this situation devolves  first and foremost  on the African countries themselves  the international community cannot be indifferent to it.The United Nations was therefore fully justified in deciding to give special attention to this situation. All of us have a duty to see to it that the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s does not suffer the same sad fate as the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. Thus the plan must be launched urgently and the necessary resources must be provided for the plans of action envisaged by the institutions and bodies concerned with its implementation.He hope that the conference on the development of Africa  to take place in Japan in 1993  will provide an opportunity to mobilize additional resources to relaunch growth and start economic recovery in our continent. The Secretary-General's initiative with regard to the convening of an international conference on finance for development is based on these very concerns and deserves the international community's support.The resources available in the world are commensurate with the great challenges of our time. In fact  the international context has never been so favorable for the beginning of a genuine North-South dialog taking into account the interests of all. In this regard  a global summit on social development would provide an opportunity to embark on an in-depth analysis of human development in all its aspects  in the context of the forthcoming international meetings on human rights  women  and population. Indeed  we must agree to attach to the economic  social and cultural rights of the individual the importance that is now attached unfortunately  too often selectively to civil and political rights. Thus we could conquer poverty and create the conditions for sustainable development  taking into account simultaneously the needs of growth and the imperatives of protection of the environment  in the interest of mankind. The establishment during the present session of a committee for sustainable development would be an important step towards achieving this goal.Progress and economic and social development are possible only in a climate of global peace and security. Unfortunately there are still numerous conflicts and hotbeds of tension  which seriously imperil peace. Therefore  we are particularly alarmed at the deplorable violent ethnic conflicts that are tearing apart the peoples in the former Yugoslavia. Cameroon appeals to the sense of reason of the parties to the conflict to halt this war  which is the result of an obsolete and deplorable ideology. He shall continue to support all steps taken by the Security Council  the European Community and other bodies to achieve a satisfactory solution.With regard to the Middle East  the peace process that was launched in Madrid and is still under way must be maintained with a view to keeping alive the possibility of achieving a peace capable of standing the test of time and of men and  once and for all  reconciling the peoples of that region.With respect to South Africa  a harmonious transition to a democratic  non-racial and united country free of violence is in the interests of all.The prospects that emerged from the recent Mandela-de Klerk summit are positive  and we firmly support them.While welcoming the maintenance of the cease-fire in Cambodia  we call on all the parties involved to cooperate fully with the United Nations Transitional Authority so that it may be enabled to carry out its mission within the framework of the Paris Agreements. Cameroon is proud to have been able to able to contribute to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) by sending to that friendly country a contingent of civil forces and a group to supervise the cease-fire. We take this opportunity to reiterate our willingness to serve the cause of peace.We also welcome the culmination of the peace process in Angola  where elections have just been held under the aegis of the United Nations. In that fraternal country  there is opening up an opportunity to achieve internal reconciliation and to embark on the work of national reconstruction  which will inject new dynamism into the efforts to attain economic integration in our subregion.We earnestly hope that there will be a similar course of events in Somalia  Liberia  Mozambique  Western Sahara and all other regions of the world that are still torn by conflicts.Unfortunately  international peace and security  the environment and development are not the only major challenges of the day. The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic  drugs  terrorism and other scourges call for ever greater mobilization  and we shall continue to support measures decreed by the international community to counteract them. Action taken in this area must be pursued and strengthened. That is why we repeat our support for initiatives to convene a global summit on social development# the world conference on women# the conference on African children# the conference on population and development# and the conference on human rights.Finally# with regard to natural disasters and man-made emergencies# we approve the steps the Organization has taken towards restructuring# rationalization and coordination steps that have led to the establishment of the Office of the United Nations Coordinator for Disaster Relief.As was emphasized last year# Cameroon has opted for democracy and has resolutely begun profound changes designed to establish a more democratic society with ever greater respect for the fundamental human rights and freedoms of its citizens. Following legislative elections# in which transparency and proper conduct were noted by numerous independent observers of various nationalities# Cameroon acquired a multi-party Parliament# in which democracy is given free expression.The pluralist# democratic and adversarial nature of the new society in Cameroon has led to the establishment of a coalition Government responsible to Parliament. In a few days' time on 11 October this process will culminate in the holding of presidential elections involving at least eight candidates. We owe all this progress to President Paul Biya a man of renewal whose attachment to openness and whose commitment to democracy in Cameroon have never been denied.Cameroon wants to play its part in meeting the needs inherent in theembryonic new world order. Clearly this is a long-term objective  which must be pursued at a pace appropriate to our society and which  if it is to be successful  requires the assistance and cooperation of all people of good will. I know that we can count on that. "
"33",1433,"COD",47,1992,"In addressing this Assembly for the first time  I should like  first  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  to carry out the pleasant duty of conveying to Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria our most earnest and warmest congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session  and to assure him of our cooperation with a view to achieving a successful outcome. We should like also to take this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia for the deft and skilful manner in which he led the work of the last session. To the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  we reiterate our most earnest congratulations on the outstanding manner in which he has been discharging his difficult responsibilities since he was elected head of our Organization. We also take this opportunity to welcome the positive and beneficial influence of the activities of our former Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who was able to give our Organization a new dynamism and brought it closer to the goals assigned to it by its founding fathers. On behalf of Zaire  I welcome the new Member States that have joined the Organization  thereby bringing us closer to its much-desired goal of universality. But we are bound to note that the purposes of our Organization laid down in its Charter are far from being achieved  because in many places throughout the world the universal peace that we so earnestly seek is still just an ambition. Indeed  hotbeds of tension have been rekindled  thereby jeopardizing international peace and security  which our Organization has a duty to guarantee. We earnestly appeal to all parties in conflict  wherever they may be  to lay down their arms and exclude the word ""force"" from their vocabulary. In this vein  we find a great deal of merit in the Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  to the international community  in which we find valuable recommendations on preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. We believe that the Assembly should give the greatest attention to this analysis. Zaire pledges its help in studying these ideas  so useful to our Organization. The Secretary-General's recommendations lead us to focus on a few of the many areas of tension. The Security Council meeting on violence in South Africa made it possible to avoid a break in the dialogue established within the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). We reiterate our appeal to all political forces to put an end to their antagonism so that negotiations for the establishment of a representative government may resume. To this end  we strongly urge the South African Government to use all necessary ways and means to put an end to extremist acts of all kinds that lead to violence. In the Middle East  since the establishment of the Government resulting from the latest elections in Israel and the resumption of negotiations between the parties concerned  we have reason for some hope. We Therefore urge all parties committed to the quest for an overall political solution that would lead to lasting peace in that region to continue along the path of dialogue. For some years now we have witnessed considerable efforts by the United States of America and the Russian Federation the Powers with the most sophisticated and most destructive weapons  whether nuclear  conventional  biological or chemical drastically to reduce the number of such weapons  thereby helping to establish a new era in international politics and in peace and security for States and peoples. Zaire welcomes this most sincerely  and we hope that other military Powers will follow their example. If they do  the second millennium  for which we are preparing so busily  will open up new prospects for humankind as a whole. Today  in a surge of world-wide solidarity  the developed countries living in prosperity should help  in a spirit of true partnership  the countries of the South to solve the problems related to underdevelopment  which have many complex causes. It is true that underdevelopment will not go away overnight simply because the prosperous countries of the North decide to make available to third world countries financial resources resulting from cutbacks they may make in their military budgets; rather it will be ended by strategies to do away with the dire poverty of the nations of Africa and other underdeveloped countries. That is why Zaire is convinced that a harmonious future for our planet depends on peace  security and prosperity shared by all nations  both of the North and of the South. And that is why Zaire also believes that the Final Document of the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development should now be implemented in order to find the necessary resources to solve the daunting problems our peoples face. It is clear that the collective security aspects likely to create tension and conflict in the world are not only military  but also spring from the extreme impoverishment of our peoples  linked to high population growth rates and the debt burden. Looking at our ravaged economies  we believe that debt servicing must in no way hamstring our development efforts. Our countries' total external debt is constantly increasing  and has now reached more than $1.5 billion. Without any real readiness to cooperate on the part of the industrialized countries  and without considerable efforts devoted to the planning and establishment of appropriate ad hoc structures  there will be no hope of recovery for our economies. We strongly hope that those devising strategic development policies for the fourth decade will take into account the recommendations of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) resulting from the Conference of Ministers responsible for economic development and planning  held in Addis Ababa from 20 to 24 April of this year  which drew up guidelines for the years ahead. We also hope that  in accordance with the New International Development Strategy for the 1990s  the United Nations and the international community will support efforts aimed at the economic recovery of Africa  for the common good of all humankind. Zaire hails the effective measures to protect and improve the environment envisaged in the Rio Conventions. Indeed  as we have vast areas of protected forests  we would appreciate acceptance by the international community of the idea of recompensing countries that set aside major forested areas with a view to protecting them from the ravages of humankind. Zaire  whose vast expanses of tropical rainforest have given it the status of the planet's ""second lung""  after Amazonia  has for long been in the vanguard of environmental conservation. Our country has a major network of linked national parks and reserves covering 8 per cent of our national territory. Some of these nature reserves the oldest of which were established more than 75 years ago - protect the rarest of species  including the okapi  the white rhinoceros and the gorilla. In the context of the Conventions adopted in Rio de Janeiro  Zaire offers all these natural resources to the international community as a contribution to the common heritage of humankind. Therefore  my country calls upon the international community  particularly the developed countries  to ensure that additional resources are made available for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the new Conventions dealing with biodiversity and climate change. My delegation appeals to all countries to give massive support to Agenda 21 and its accompanying Conventions; it asks that they sign them and take all the necessary steps to ratify them. We invite countries of the North that might still be hesitant about adapting their future behaviour to the requirements of environmental conservation and protection to respond positively. It is no secret to anyone that Zaire is today experiencing a deep multisectoral crisis essentially attributable to the disastrous management of its human  financial and material resources. The readiness for change expressed by our people as a whole triumphed on 24 April 1990 with the statement delivered by the President of the Republic  which finally recognized the need for democratic political reform. Following the example of other African countries  Zairians claimed and obtained the holding of a national sovereign conference. Opened in August 1991  that conference is taking place in an atmosphere whose tone was set  on the one hand  by the troubles of September 1991  which ruined the country's already reeling economy  and  on the other  by a succession of political crises spawned in the climate of distrust that existed between the established powers and the opposition. Suspended a number of times  the work of the national sovereign conference none the less has managed to continue to this day because our people has spared no sacrifice to lend its full support to this forum. Because of this  the date of 16 February will live in our memory. Thus  as I speak  the meetings of the national sovereign conference are about to culminate  more than a year after its opening  in the adoption of committee reports following the election of a Prime Minister and the establishment of a transition Government. The transition period will be managed by three institutions: the Presidency of the Republic  the Supreme Council of the Republic  and the transition Government. As regards the transition Government  the national sovereign conference elected Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi Wa Mulumba as Prime Minister in the vote held last August. The transition Government pledges before international opinion to guide this period of transition in the calmest and most peaceful manner possible. The essential  indeed overriding  goal of the transition remains the establishment of a state based upon the rule of law. Welcoming the role played by the free press in the evolution of democracy in our country  the Government is determined to encourage and support the media so that they can play their full role in all freedom. Moreover  the transition Government and the Supreme Council of the Republic will establish the High Council for Audio-Visual Media  which will manage the official press agencies in the same spirit. The Government is also committed to fighting censorship and to promoting freedom of the press in all its forms. The establishment of a State based on the rule of law necessarily entails respect for the rights of the individual. That is why the Government will work in concert with the associations responsible for human rights issues. To that end  they will be granted the civil status that has been hitherto denied them  as well as being guaranteed access to the media and freedom of action throughout our national territory. A top priority for the transition Government is laying the best possible groundwork for the advent of a State based on the rule of law. To this end  Zaire intends to hold free and democratic elections shortly. We therefore urgently appeal to the international community to help us organize these elections in the greatest possible transparency. In conclusion  I should like to draw attention once again to the most alarming situation of our planet  a situation on which the entire international community is focused. My delegation is convinced that the United Nations is and will remain the ideal framework for the quest for peaceful solutions likely to defuse the hotbeds of tension that have developed in Africa  Asia and Europe. As for Zaire  I have just recalled the great choices made by the national sovereign conference to provide the Zairian people with a new era of peace  democracy and economic development. In accordance with the United Nations Charter  Zaire announces its faith in the basic rights of the individual. To that end  my country will spare no effort to ensure the victory of legality  justice  equity and equality. I wish the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly the fullest measure of success. "
"34",1480,"COG",47,1992,"It is with a full awareness of the significant turning point reached by the world and the United Nations that the delegation of the Republic of Congo is approaching the work of this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly over which Mr. Ganev has the honour and privilege of presiding. On my own and my delegation's behalf  I should like to congratulate him on his unanimous election to the presidency. The General Assembly's choice reflects the high esteem and prestige which his country  Bulgaria  enjoys on the international scene. It is equally a tribute to his experience and personal qualities. I also wish once again to offer our profound gratitude to his predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  who skilfully guided the forty-sixth session. My delegation would like to ensure Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  of its full cooperation. Lastly  I wish to extend a warm welcome to the new Members  whose admission further strengthens the universality of the United Nations. I am pleased to say that the delegation of the Republic of the Congo will be happy to work with them during the forty-seventh session and in the future. The cold war has run its course. Upon the ruins of more than 40 years of extreme tension. States and the United Nations system are striving to organize on this planet a new  more democratic and more humane order. Under the impetus of world developments  which have galvanized the spirit of reform everywhere  the United Nations as an institution is undergoing a process of change. It has accordingly undertaken major initiatives in the realm of cooperation for development and in the realm of peace-keeping operations and the restoration of peace. What new ideas are emerging? What are their chances of success? What risks are posed to human rights and democracy by the challenges of growing poverty  third-world debt  the AIDS pandemic  drugs  and ethnic and religious hatreds  and by ecological disasters or those that  as we approach the end of the century  result from the world population explosion? As has been stated  the meeting held by the Security Council on 31 January 1992 was the first it had ever held at the level of Heads of State or Government. That summit symbolized the end of an era of discord that had long paralysed the United Nations. It is understandable that the international Organization should henceforth seek to define itself. It wishes to strengthen its potential in various areas  while at the same time increasing its efficacy in complying with the provisions of the Charter. Africa and the developing countries are active partners in reform. For is that not part of a new universalism which has become more urgent and whose aim remains the satisfaction of fundamental needs? Let us concern ourselves as much with the flowering of dignity and human rights as with the economic and social well-being of all peoples. For Africa in particular  external assistance stands as a basic principle. But it is also to a large extent the starting point of Africa's development. That is why Africa will remain vigilant about subtle proposals that tend to marginalize its relations with the world system. Thus  in this new interplay of interests aimed at introducing a new culture into the United Nations  Africa has everything to gain by preserving  for instance  the decisive role the United Nations plays  under the relevant provisions of the Charter  in the realm of cooperation for economic and social development. In all times  the Governments that we have the honour to represent have assumed to right to lead people by assuming the duty to address forcefully the needs of the immediate present  the hypothetical  the near future  and the long-term. The first ambition remains to work for better societies that offer the citizen  both as an individual and as part of the whole  less alienation and less constraint with more knowledge and more freedom. It is noteworthy that in the constant struggle for man and society  the community of nations assembled within the United Nations has accompanied national efforts with appropriate assistance. The General Assembly  ennobled by its solemn nature  captures the resounding echo of public opinion from around the world. In this respect  it is a major source of hope. The demands which the Organization must now meet are unprecedented in their nature. The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in his report on the work of the Organization  has written that: ""The turning-point in the scale and scope of United Nations activities can be discerned after the year 1987. For the first time in many years  agreement on a wide range of issues became possible  effectively marking an end to the cold war."" (A/47/1  para. 14) Thus  today more than ever  the debate in the General Assembly is rich with a variety of issues that illustrate the expanding role of the Organization. In actual fact  what is involved are generally new  modern challenges that the States Members of the Organization will have to confront. This state of affairs  disturbing in itself  is mitigated by the dispelling of some problems. Furthermore  a number of diverse national experiences  full of opportunity and hope  have developed in recent years and acquired real significance for freedom and restored democracy in a number of countries. I once again welcome the fact that the United Nations is contributing actively to the democratization efforts of these nations  which are referred to in the report on the work of Organization that I have already mentioned. I should like to address the specific case of the institutions in my country  the Congo. In specific terms  the Republic of the Congo is moving towards an enlarged and more participatory democracy  the blossoming of the intellectual and psychological potential of the Congolese people  and the growth of national solidarity. Decentralization  the keystone of the new policy of Professor Pascal Lissouba  the first democratically elected President of the Republic  will grant administrative powers to regions in the areas of management and economic development. There are two dimensions involved in this: the rehabilitation or construction of administrative installations  and the promotion of initiative and innovation in the area of development and the rural environment. The aim is to improve living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population by giving them the means to gain access to decent housing  with the emphasis on local building materials  water supply and sanitation  family health  the education of infants  and income-generating activities. In the course of this year  1992  through the exercise of universal suffrage  the Congolese people  during successive free and fair elections performed their duties as active citizens under the supervision of international observers  to whom my Government expresses its profound gratitude for the very beneficial assistance they provided our country. The happy outcome of these elections today heralds a new era  that of democracy  to which our people is henceforth committed. Congolese public opinion  revitalized by a reborn national press  has effectively contributed to averting political violence. In short  the Congo is now engaged in meaningful structural reform  starting at the institutional level. The Congo's new Constitution  adopted by referendum on 15 March 1992  during the transitional period following the national conference  increases freedoms in all areas. Almost 45 articles make up chapter II of the Constitution on rights and fundamental freedoms. Our Constitution also provides for balanced public powers and seeks to establish strengthened solidarity and equity. The establishment of democracy at the local level not without its risks set the first conclusive test for the Congolese people. Local councils and mayors were elected by universal suffrage. Despite some inevitable but minor hitches  the overall system functioned in a satisfactory manner. It is important to note the people's commitment to the new political  economic  social  and cultural foundations upon which  after 30 years of error and disarray  the new political legitimacy of our country now rests. A bicameral parliament has been elected  with predominance given to the first chamber  the National Assembly  to which the government is accountable. Its functioning reflects the meticulous Congolese electoral process. This process culminated with the presidential election held on 2 and 16 August 1992. This final phase readily highlighted to public opinion  long unfamiliar with such things  the complex interplay of the many political parties and their strategic alliances. The presidential election was carried out in two ballots. It was hotly contested. The Congolese electors voted without constraint in secret ballot. Professor Pascal Lissouba was elected President of the Republic of the Congo. message of the President of the Republic  His Excellency Professor Pascal Lissouba. There are many reasons for hope nowadays. For our country  the message proclaims  there is an irresistible democratic urge that has freed energies and galvanized enthusiasm. Everything has once more become possible. This historic new beginning implies a break with a development fundamentally based on such factors external to our civil society as international assistance  negotiated or imposed improvement in the terms of trade  foreign investment  and the preponderant intervention of the State. The new idea is that economic development and social progress should be based principally on the sense of initiative  the creativity of individuals and the civil society  and on their capacity to act  innovate  and better manage the human resources and riches of the Congo. As will have been noted  Congo's ambitions are bold. Mindful of the magnitude of the task before us  the President of the Republic of Congo has stated: ""The concept of democracy nowadays may appear to be a gift. It is a culture  and any culture is a blending. Thus we  by virtue of our own culture  which involves a methodical and deliberate search for consensus  must mitigate the inhumane or hard-to-accept aspects of a democracy fashioned in other climes."" The President went on to ask: ""What is law without custom?"" That is why he calls for: ""respect for the assets of the community and for the love of work. This is what it will take to win the respect of our partners  even this must necessarily rest with strengthening our links with our usual partners""-In this vital recovery effort  the Government of national union and the Congolese people will be able to derive the greatest possible benefit from cooperation with industrialized countries  with international organizations  including non-governmental organizations  and from the contribution of new forms of cooperation  without frontiers  between towns  regions and enterprises in the north and in the south. Members will not be surprised to hear me speak of certain major problems that call for the attention of the international community and  hence  of the United Nations. It is quite natural that any member State might ask itself ""What can be done? Where can we start?"" It seems to us that the general debate is an excellent opportunity to gather together the material for a response to these questions  on the basis of proposals and of the desire of some to take action and others to refrain from taking action. What is our attitude at this moment of great political and ideological upheaval? The Congo shares the view that it is essential that the United Nations continue to be an especially well-suited forum for the analysis of events and for concept development  particularly in respect of socio-economic problems  in a spirit of renewed partnership. Indeed  the United Nations must serve as the right institution within which to strive for global solutions. Those solutions must take into account the political  humanitarian and socio-economic dimensions of world problems. My delegation endorses this approach  particularly with respect to assistance  trade  the transfer of technologies  commodity prices and debt relief. There is a prevailing feeling that the United Nations has a fresh opportunity to attain the objectives of the Charter - in particular  the maintenance of peace and the restoration of peace and  it should be added since the summit meeting of the Security Council  the promotion of preventive diplomacy. Despite all the scepticism. Member States would be justified in keeping alive the flame that was lit on 31 January in New York. In this respect my delegation cannot but associate itself with the wise words that have already been spoken from this rostrum. Sadly  it must be acknowledged that the end of the cold war has not put an end to age-old antagonisms. After so many promising and hopeful events  we witnessed the Yugoslav crisis break out suddenly in the heart of Europe. In Africa  in addition to the mounting violence in South Africa violence that reflects the difficult birth pangs of a democratic  non-racial and united South Africa the Liberian and Somalian tragedies continue to give us reason to fear the destabilization of a number of States. As representatives must be well aware  all these concerns have an impact on subregional security. Is it still acceptable that  in a world rich in rights and freedoms  not all peoples are really receiving the benefit thereof? Continued tribal or ethnic conflicts  accompanied by war crimes  if viewed with indifference  may lead almost unnoticed to the extermination of tens of thousands of people. In Europe  people are dying in the name of ideology  and in Somalia  in the extreme eastern part of the African continent  the situation is even more tragic. Drought  combined with mindless blood-letting by clans fighting over the shreds of power  are claiming thousands of victims. There is undoubtedly a need for more international assistance. Here  once again  the activities of the United Nations deserve praise. We should also hail the role of the non-governmental organizations in their daily endeavours in the service of the human individual  as a gesture of solidarity with mankind  regarded in its universal nature as a reasonable being. The picture is not an entirely gloomy one  if we can judge by the glimmers of hope coming from the talks that are under way in  for example  Liberia and the Middle East. In the case of South Africa  all parties must agree to end the violence  and they must show restraint. The parties must cooperate in order to bring about the earliest possible resumption of the negotiation process. The developments of the last few weeks give us grounds to hope that this will  indeed  happen. In any event  the Republic of the Congo supports the initiatives and all the efforts being made by the international community to find the right solutions to these questions. It is in this spirit that  despite its difficult economic circumstances  the Congo is contributing to various operations within the United Nations framework. Recently we participated in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II)  following the positive experience of our presence in UNAVEM I. Likewise  my country supports the initiatives and decisions relating to arms reduction  the halting of nuclear tests and the endeavours intended to promote transparency in international transfers of conventional arms. The promotion of confidence-building  peace and security is still the constant concern of many States - in particular  the States of the central African subregion. In this context  in May  the Standing Advisory Committee on Security Matters was created under the auspices of the United Nations. This is one more instrument in the system of subregional cooperation. Although we must unite our efforts to overcome war  it is not true that the peoples that are not experiencing the turmoils of war are necessarily living in peace. A glance at a map of the world proves that the reverse is true. Africa  for example  is suffering from drought  famine and disease an appalling picture that calls for action from the community of nations. It is clear that  along with the questions of the maintenance of peace  drug abuse  the environment and humanitarian assistance  Africa is one of the five priorities of the United Nations in the 1990s. Paradoxically  however  since the adoption  on 18 December 1991  of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s  the implementation of that programme  based on a new partnership  is suffering from a lack of priority. This situation requires attention. The problems of drug abuse present another painful and devastating picture for the peoples of the continents of Europe  America and Asia. How can we successfully tackle all these challenges and others the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic  for example without cooperation and solidarity between States? There is one undeniable fact: the aspiration to democracy is now universal. This heightened awareness should be regarded as a tremendous advance that will promote peace and security in the world. For the developing countries  our thinking should now concentrate on the future and the fate of that democracy in other words  on how to build on the achievements stemming from the advent of a democratic system in a good number of countries. In other words  democracy and development are indivisible. It is only by linking the two aspects of the question that we shall be able to derive the proper benefits from the changes that we all nowadays recognize as significant on the eve of the third millennium. "
"35",1527,"COL",47,1992,"I should like to begin by extending a warm welcome to the new States Members of the United Nations. Colombia hopes to be allied with all of them as they strive to consolidate the growth of democracy. I should also like to congratulate the President on his election to lead this session of the Assembly  and to express our recognition of the leadership and effectiveness shown by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in making the United Nations the home of peace  development and progress for humanity. I address all gathered here today at the General Assembly with a profound feeling of sorrow  because at this moment thousands of defenceless people are victims of the war against Bosnia and Herzegovina and because in Somalia thousands are dying of hunger. I would urge the General Assembly of the United Nations to take at this session a decisive step forward in resolving these world conflicts. Among the trends that nourish our hopes for the future of mankind  we should highlight the decisive role that the United Nations has undertaken to play as a catalyst of the new global agenda. But the Organization still has many of the features inherited from the cold-war period. Reforms must move forward with prudence and patience  but also with the certainty that the decision-making mechanisms of the United Nations will be more democratic  more equal  more representative and more effective. Only then will we be able to advance the future role of the United Nations. The ""Agenda for Peace"" presented by the Secretary-General is certainly a guideline for our achievement of these objectives. In the past  when the world was divided into two- irreconcilable poles  it was almost impossible to reach agreement even on the simplest of ideas. But now conditions exist for multilateral organizations to become the principal actors of the new world order. But here too we must call for caution. The key problems of the new world agenda cannot be resolved without the active participation of developing nations. This new principal role in the management of the international agenda must be recognized by the industrialized countries if we are to make truly viable a multilateral approach based on mutual cooperation. At the same time  the industrialized nations cannot continue using multilaterism selectively. Also  the developed countries will have to abandon the practice of using multilateral organizations as mere instruments to legitimize their unilateral decisions. This is a double standard that puts at risk the success of multilateral solutions. Five hundred years ago  thanks to the courage of Columbus  the meeting of two worlds that were separated by fear and ignorance became possible. Because of his accomplishment the planet became one  awakening mankind to undreamt of horizons of progress and well-being. Only a few decades ago the cold war separated the world into two once again. During that time people were not separated into isolated continents but into opposing blocs divided by an immense ocean of distrust and hate. Now  as the world celebrates the five hundredth anniversary of the discovery  humanity once again has an opportunity to forge a truly global community. The joy of liberated peoples dancing on top of crumbling walls is  alas  fleeting. Democracy in Europe and America has shown that it is not enough to defeat dictatorship in order to achieve true freedom. The tyranny of poverty  drugs  terrorism  fratricidal war  stagnation and paper democracies continues to be an unavoidable threat to peace  security and well-being. Perhaps things did seem easier in the past when we believed we had just one enemy communism or militarism. Now we can see more clearly the real evils afflicting mankind. Even though there are powerful reasons for optimism about the future  we cannot give up our enthusiasm thinking these difficulties have now all been overcome. We have a new agenda which we must begin to undertake with the same effort and dedication with which the cold war was fought. The road to a new international order is plagued by paradoxes. While the developing nations are embracing the benefits of free trade  the industrialized nations are sticking to protectionist barriers and creating new restrictive trade procedures. At the very moment these trends are occurring the industrialized nations are cheerfully proclaiming to the four winds the triumph of the free market. If the world economy continues along the road of protectionism the possibilities of creating a new international order based politically on democratic principles and economically on individual freedoms will continue to recede. Without access to markets we will not be able to achieve the levels of economic development necessary to defeat poverty and to promote a climate of world peace. Confronting this return to protectionism must be one of the principal contributions to peace and the progress of mankind. It is equally paradoxical that  when events signal a new era of international solidarity  symptoms of growing isolationism exist. The industrialized countries are focusing increasingly on their internal affairs  sidestepping their obligation to contribute to peace and progress in the global community. A world in which hundreds of millions live in poverty without any hope of a better life cannot afford the luxury of egoism. The wealthier countries cannot turn their backs on these multitudes by proclaiming that all of mankind's problems will be resolved by the invisible hand of the market-place. Now more than ever solidarity is essential. When East and West extended their confrontation to the furthest corners of the planet the developing countries enjoyed the most perverse dividend of the conflict. There was never a lack of external resources to feed the euphoria of war. Now that the guns have been silenced  international assistance for democracy and for alleviating poverty is elusive. Now that there is a need for generosity  and solidarity is the only argument put forward in support of it  the helping hand is withdrawn and the back is turned. The Earth Summit was certainly a milestone in the history of mankind. Rio de Janeiro is the beginning of a long road that must be travelled to reconcile man with nature. Unfortunately there are dangerous trends in the industrialized countries threatening international cooperation on environmental problems. For example  there is the unilateral imposition of barriers and environmental conditions for our countries. This is not good policy. It could lead to an unacceptable situation in which the North continues to advance and pollute and the South remains poor in order to reduce the global environmental degradation caused by the industrialized nations. This new form of environmental protectionism is a source of conflict that must be dealt with. I know all too well that when Colombia's name is mentioned in the great capitals of the world people inevitably think of drug-trafficking. Unfortunately this has been so because my people  armed only with their strength and their courage  have had to take on an unequal and heroic lone battle against the most powerful and most perverse criminals known to mankind. Colombia is a victim of the uncontrollable appetite for drugs throughout the world. Three days ago the bullets that killed a valiant Colombian judge  Myriam Rocio Velez  were bought with money from cocaine consumers. The bribes that corrupt the law enforcement and prison authorities in our country come out of the pockets of drug addicts in the major capitals of the world. The dynamite used in car bombs that assassinate innocent citizens in the streets of Colombia is paid for with the money of those who consider their insatiable vice as harmless and innocent. It hurts us even more that those who point an accusing finger at a courageous people who have endured so many sacrifices are precisely those who have no problem ignoring a neighbour who uses drugs  launders money  traffics in arms  illegally exports precursor chemicals or runs drug distribution networks in streets and cities. There is no doubt that in Colombia we have lost some battles and have suffered severe setbacks  including the recent and widely publicized escape from prison of a group of well-known drug-traffickers. In spite of that bitter medicine we can say with pride that no other country in the world has fought the scourge of drugs with such resolve and success. The treason of some corrupt officials who gave up their dignity for a handful of dollars does not negate the sacrifices of the thousands of Colombians who are fighting in defence of democracy and mankind. Hear me well: it is true that Pablo Escobar escaped from jail but he will not escape from the firm resolve of Colombians to see justice done. I am convinced that by keeping to our legendary firmness  Colombia will soon be liberated forever from violence and crime. But  unfortunately  drug-trafficking is an international crime that threatens mankind in every corner of the planet. It is not enough for only the Colombians to be valiant and victorious. Today in Colombia we have drug-traffickers  tomorrow they will be in sister nations. Today their enterprise is cocaine; tomorrow they will be looking for other new  lucrative products such as heroin. Today they are making millions from the demand in the United States; tomorrow they will be getting even richer with money from Europe and Japan. We are already seeing these changes and these adaptations. Drug-trafficking is a hydra-headed monster; it is not enough to cut off just one head or only a few heads. To eradicate this scourge once and for all we need to take decisive  collective action  international and multilateral action  against this evil on all fronts. Two years ago I stood before the Assembly and called on all Members to work together against drug-trafficking. Now we must ask the question: what have we achieved since then? Two years ago the drug cartels looked invincible  were even threatening to destroy democracy in Colombia and impose a reign of terror and violence. Today most of those enemies of society are dead or in jail. Two years ago the industrialized world  with an accusing gesture  held responsible for the problem those very countries that are in fact victims of the production and processing of drugs. Today we know that the consumers of drugs  are the source of the problem and cannot evade their responsibilities. Two years ago international financial centres were accepting funds from the most dubious sources without regard as to the propriety of their actions. Today we have started to see a change in attitude. Two years ago  drug trafficking was growing out of control. Today  from one end to the other of the western hemisphere  we have achieved unprecedented levels of drug interdiction. Two years ago  the epidemic of drug use looked uncontainable. Today  we are certain that the demand for drugs can be controlled if the necessary economic resources are made available. Two years ago  no one recognized the close ties between poverty  the absence of economic opportunity and the emergence of drug trafficking. Today  we know that alternative development  trade opportunities and economic aid are needed to overcome the drug problem. But all this progress real progress is not enough. Drug trafficking adapts itself easily to the efforts of society to stamp it out. Criminal organizations  now not only in Colombia but practically all over the world  have entered into this illegal business. While consumption is dropping in the United States  it is growing in Europe and Asia. Today  more than ever before  we must strengthen international cooperation in the struggle against this enemy of humanity. Today  more than ever  we need a vision of the future to guide our efforts and guarantee our people that the problem can be overcome. That is why I want to challenge the international community today. I invite you join me in establishing clear goals and measurable commitments so that all of us will know where we want to go and when we hope to get there. In this way  we will be able to guide political decisions to generate the necessary resources. That is also why I propose that the United Nations define global  regional and country targets for controlling the problem of drugs. We must commit ourselves to reducing the supply of drugs and the demand for them by at least 50 per cent by the year 2000  by 70 per cent by the year 2005  and free humanity for ever from the scourge of drugs by the year 2010. As of now  before the international community  Colombia assumes the responsibility of complying with these objectives in its territory. We intend to enter the next century with sales of arms  the sale and diversion of precursor chemicals and money-laundering activities under control. The need to free humanity from the scourge of drugs requires a plan for global action. This is why I call on the General Assembly to hold a United Nations conference on the problem of illicit drugs where the necessary commitments and programmes would emerge to make it possible for drug trafficking to be defeated completely in the next decade and a half. It is beyond doubt that international criminal organizations have consolidated their extensive network of ties and contacts much faster than the judicial system is capable of investigating and prosecuting those responsible. The Italian judges Giovanna Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and the Colombian judge Myriam Rocio Velez  along with very many others who have fallen in the fight against international organized crime  were facing powerful enemies; the existing laws and the mechanisms were not enough. The individual courage of these heroes of justice is also not enough. There must be no borders or barriers if those who have decided to unite in evil are to be prosecuted effectively everywhere on Earth. We need justice to be universal  and for it to work in as coordinated a manner in all countries as the international criminal organizations do. The Mafia  cartels  camorra  and yakuza are just different names for the same thing. The time has come to treat organized crime as an international crime. As I said in my inaugural address  it is vital to develop an international criminal jurisdiction against drug trafficking  money laundering and the illegal export of precursor chemicals. Wherever the guilty live or serve their sentences  it must be possible for the courts in all countries to be able  voluntarily  to have recourse to international courts where  in a secure manner and with all the evidence available world wide  these many and serious crimes can be tried. Now is the time for the United Nations to tackle this question in a serious  dedicated way. Also  we must improve the machinery at our disposal for judicial cooperation between countries. That is why we would like to see a United Nations convention for judicial cooperation on felonies that would facilitate the flow of evidence  the standardization of testimony and supporting documentation  and reduce the bureaucratic procedures and legal obstacles to coordinated action by the criminal legal systems of different countries. We would also like to see real involvement by the European Community and by Japan and other countries in Asia in the Cartagena and San Antonio agreements and commitments. In Cartagena and San Antonio  the participating countries agreed a set of strategies at all levels in the fight against drug trafficking. This effort has already yielded results  but the moment has come to extend this cooperation to the rest of the world community. Lastly  let me say that I believe that the experience acquired through all these years of the difficult fight against drug trafficking has given our authorities some knowledge which  beyond a doubt  is of great value to many other countries which are starting to experience the consequences of the global spread of drug trafficking. This is why Colombia has decided to establish an international centre for the fight against drug trafficking; this will allow us to make available to the global community what we have learned through so much sacrifice. I invite the United Nations and all Member States to contribute to  and participate in  this initiative. I know that in a short time  supported by my compatriots' courage and resolve to fight  by the valour of the judges of Colombia  by the greatness of the people of my country  we shall not have to talk about violence and drug trafficking here within the walls of the United Nations. Wars do not go on for ever  and I do not recall a single criminal who has resisted the pressure of the will of an entire people; and  if my call today has been heard  those criminal organizations will be even less able to resist the united will of the international community. Perhaps then  soon  when we leave behind the dark night of drug trafficking  the world will see the other  friendlier face of my country  and discover what we really are: we are the strongest and oldest democracy in the region. We are the most dynamic economy in Latin America. Our country has grown at a sustained rate of nearly 4 per cent per year for the last three decades. Our management of the economy has been prudent and thoughtful  and has kept us clear of the problems associated with indebtedness  hyperinflation  stagnation and unemployment. When someone comes to my country and meets my people  and does not encounter all the horrors that have sometimes been painted in the press  he becomes our compatriot  and he learns that to be Colombian is a form of pride  of hidden tenacity and sharp wit. He also knows that you do not have to be born in our country to be a Colombian for ever. "
"36",1568,"COM",47,1992,"I have the particularly agreeable duty  on behalf of the people and Government of the Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros  of conveying to Mr. Ganev warm and sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. We have every confidence in his ability  as a distinguished diplomat  to ensure complete success for our work. I should like to take this opportunity also to express to Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia our total satisfaction with  and our profound admiration of  the effective way in which he conducted the work of the General Assembly at its last session. May I also take this agreeable opportunity to wish the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  every success in the discharge of the noble and lofty mission that we have entrusted to him. I assure my dear brother and friend that in his efforts to ensure that the United Nations plays the part it is intended to play he will have the unflagging support of my country  the Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros. His election is a matter of pride for Africa and for the Arab world. Likewise  it reflects the standing and the dynamic role of his great country  Egypt  on the international scene. His determination to breathe new life into our Organization  to strengthen its role and its effectiveness  gives us grounds for great hope for its future. The Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace"" a document that was drawn up after the summit meeting of the Security Council last January contains concrete proposals that demand the attention of Member States. In this context  I should like to voice our complete satisfaction with the very pertinent ideas that the Secretary-General was able to set forth in such a short period. In our view  his proposals deserve the international community's very careful scrutiny to ensure that the greatest possible benefit is derived from them. The delegation of Comoros joins those Members that have already extended a warm welcome to the States that have recently been admitted to membership of the Organization. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the world is beginning a new chapter in its history. The profound and far-reaching transformations that our planet has undergone during the past four years are very encouraging. General ideological confrontation is rapidly disappearing  and dictatorial and authoritarian Governments are falling one after another. We are witnessing a renewal of freedom  equality and respect for the dignity of man. The cold war has ended  and the world has heaved a sigh of relief. Our Organization has an unprecedented opportunity to discharge the mandate entrusted to it by the Charter. Unfortunately  just as we were rejoicing at the end of the cold war  with its inherent threat of nuclear destruction - at a time when we were entitled to hope for a more peaceful world  in which priority would be given to the eradication of starvation and sickness other scourges arose  and they have made the current trends in international affairs more fragile. A plethora of conflicts  of which no one could previously have conceived  have appeared on the scene; each of them has its special features and must be settled in a very precise manner. In the political area  old conflicts such as those of the Middle East  of Palestine and of apartheid are still going on and to these have been added new crises such as those of Somalia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and if these are not resolved in time  they may well prove to be a threat to international peace and security. As regards the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  my country believes that this is by no means a civil war but rather an act of aggression perpetrated against a young State by the forces of Serbia and Montenegro. We therefore join the international community in condemning unreservedly this ignoble act  which constitutes a violation of the fundamental rights of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a violation of the principles underlying our Charter. For that reason we support all the United Nations resolutions and the decisions of the recent London Conference on this matter. We also subscribe to the decision of the General Assembly to deny the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia automatic succession to the seat of the former Yugoslavia  and we support the initiative to have the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a no-fly zone. It is our hope that further steps will be taken to restore peace and stability to that part of the Balkans. We urge the Security Council  which is the main body responsible for maintaining international peace and security  to reconsider this matter in full detail with a view to putting an end to this aggression  as spelt out in Article 42 of the United Nations Charter. However  we are aware of the diffidence of the Security Council to use the means spelt out in Article 42 of the Charter to put a stop to this aggression. We therefore encourage the Council to lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia and Herzegovina so that the people  with the help of friendly countries  can exercise their legitimate right to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter. We are equally concerned at the armed conflict among the various Somali factions  which has led to flight and to famine. The persistence of this armed conflict  in addition to the natural disasters that have struck the country  has only increased the suffering of the Somali people  with extremely unfortunate consequences  particularly the loss of thousands of human lives. The proposal made at Jakarta by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries last September  namely that a conference for national reconciliation be convened to forge the unity of Somalia  seems to us to be the only way to achieve a final resolution of this regrettable conflict. My Government makes an earnest appeal to the entire international community to channel more assistance to this people  which is facing such tremendous difficulties. In southern Africa there have been encouraging signs. Thus  the Government of the Comoros welcomes the free and democratic elections that have taken place in Angola. It is our hope that that country will finally achieve lasting peace after so many years of civil war. Furthermore  it is our hope that after the peace negotiations in Rome and the recent agreement concluded in Botswana between RENAMO and the Maputo government  common ground can promptly be found so that our friends and neighbours from Mozambique may also be able to regain their peace and stability. In South Africa the changes that have occurred since the release of Nelson Mandela had given us every reason to believe that the country was irrevocably committed to a democratization of its political  social and economic life. Unfortunately  the events of Boipatong and the recent Ciskei massacres have dashed our hopes that there would shortly come into being a truly united  democratic and non-racial society in South Africa. On the subject of this same country  I should like to voice the great hope that we place in the recent Mandela-De Klerk meeting. Our most earnest hope is that the negotiations for the establishment of a representative government can be resumed as soon as possible and that democracy and law will finally win the day. The developments in Western Sahara give us reason to believe that a solution to this problem can be found in the near future. We welcome the climate that prevails at present and which proves the readiness of the parties to the conflict to contribute to finding a solution by peaceful means. We also commend the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this matter and encourage him in his efforts to bring about a rapid solution to the problem. One of the greatest threats to international peace and security has been the Middle East crisis  at the heart of which is the problem of Palestine. This problem is indeed a major challenge and one which our Organization must meet in order to strengthen its credibility and enhance its standing on the international scene. In the light of the principles set forth in the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights it is indeed intolerable that the Palestinian people  in their legitimate struggle to claim their inalienable right to a homeland  should continue to be subjected to brutalities inflicted by the Israeli authorities. With the hope that there will be a settlement of the Palestinian crisis  the international community places great hope in the international Conference for peace in that region. That is  quite clearly  the only means that can produce a viable solution to the problem by peaceful means. Thus the new spirit characterizing international relations and the readiness that has been evinced at present by the parties concerned permit us to hope that the peace process begun last October in Madrid will continue and will lead to a happy outcome of this situation. The Government of the Comoros  whose support for the struggle of the Palestinian people has been unflagging  continues to believe that the solution of the Palestinian problem necessarily implies taking into account the just claim of that people  that is  their right to have a homeland. The Gulf region will not be able to heal the wounds opened up by the aggression against  and occupation of  Kuwait by Iraq as long as Iraq fails to relinquish its unjustified claims against the State of Kuwait and as long as Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq are not returned to their country in safety and honour. For the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros the necessary conditions for the restoration of peace in this region are entirely the responsibility of Iraq. Turning to a different area  we note with pleasure the improvement in the situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula as a result of the joint efforts being made by the north and south of that country to find a swift solution to the problem. The Korean people have long suffered from the division of their country and it is high time for the international community to render its support with a view to bringing about its reunification. In this connection  my Government welcomes the coming into force of the Agreement on Reconciliation  Non-Aggression  and Exchanges and Cooperation between the two parties as well as the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Similarly  the situation in Cambodia today is looking more promising as regards a final solution to the problem. The United Nations and the entire international community are aware that restoring peace in this country necessarily implies a comprehensive political solution resulting from genuine negotiations and has always emphasized this way of proceeding. We welcome the efforts which have been made by our Organization and by the world community which resulted in the agreements signed between the Cambodian parties concerned. The Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros finally hopes that following free and democratic elections Cambodia will regain its peace and stability. In view of the rate at which authoritarian regimes are disappearing  I think we have every reason to believe that shortly there will no longer be any question of dictatorship in the world; freedom  dialogue and multiparty systems will have finally won the day  where force and violence triumphed in the past. How then can we not be optimistic in view of the fact that  similarly  the thousands of voices raised in favour of recognizing the most essential human rights will finally be heeded as a result of the World Conference on Human Rights which is scheduled for 1993? Turning to the area of economic and social development  it is regrettable to note that the very positive changes which are occurring internationally in the political field have not been accompanied by any economic progress. Thus  the problems of external indebtedness  in addition to the deterioration of the terms of trade and the decrease in development aid  continue to widen the gap that exists between the developed and the developing countries. The case of Africa  which comprises more than 20 of the least-developed countries  deserves careful attention. The adoption of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development has aroused great hope in us. We therefore appeal to the international community to live up to the commitments it made when this Programme was adopted and to lend its assistance to African development efforts. Similarly  since we are desirous of a flourishing economy for our countries  Comoros supports the decision of the Government of Japan to convene an international conference on the development of Africa in 1993. Further  the current trend in world economics is directed more and more towards the creation of more open and more sound economic and trade blocs. It is for that reason that the process of regional integration has now been recognized as being an indispensable factor in promoting economic development  particularly the development of the developing countries. Thus  the Comoros have become a member of the Indian Ocean Commission and have pledged to ratify the Treaty creating the African Economic Community as soon as the country has a national assembly. In order to revamp its own economy and to initiate the process of harmonious development  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros has just signed  with the international financial institutions of Bretton Woods  a programme of structural adjustment. But as the Assembly is aware  the implementation of the measures set forth in such a programme necessarily and always entail consequences which are very difficult for the most disadvantaged strata of the population to bear. What can we say at this stage about the Rio de Janeiro summit? Despite the unhappy realities of the depletion of the ozone layer and the continued degradation of the ecological environment  let us recognize one thing at least: the meeting in Rio de Janeiro had the merit of taking account of our concerns and projections with respect to environmental problems. Now that the relationship between the environment and development is unquestionable  we are resolved no longer to divorce one from the other. In order to ensure the viability of the strategy and programmes adopted by our various development meetings  it is essential to pay particular attention to the environment. Thus  the cooperation of the countries of the North in financing Agenda 21 is absolutely necessary. Democratic transition is a phenomenon which differs according to the specific features of each country. The Comoros itself is of course no exception to this rule. This is regarded as a period of transition which is needed to harmonize the democratic process in all its aspects. Consequently  the Comorian Government  despite a very disturbing financial and economic situation which has produced considerable social tension  has during this transitional stage adopted a posture favourable to dialogue  convinced that confrontation should in all circumstances give way to dialogue. Because of this attitude we are completely in control of the situation. Thus  stability has at no time been jeopardized  as is proved by the fact that we foiled the attempted coup d'etat of 26 September last. This attempt failed because the Comorian people  aware of its Government's efforts to set up the necessary democratic institutions and to create the circumstances which would promote its social development  did not respond to an appeal  the purpose of which was to compromise the chances of creating a real State of law. In order to realize these noble ambitions  the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros is once more turning to the international community  to the United Nations  and to its great family in particular  to remind them that now  more than ever  it has need of their unflagging support to save this embryonic democracy and to place it on a solid basis. I cannot conclude my remarks before the Assembly without referring to the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte  which has appeared on successive agendas of sessions of the General Assembly since we acceded to international sovereignty. This unfortunate problem has been going on for 17 years now and to our great regret pits us against France  a country with which we have very close ties of friendship and cooperation. We will not go into the facts which underlie this problem here since the question is to be the subject of a special debate in a few days. I should simply like to recall that the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros has always favoured dialogue and has always abided by the rule of law in its attempts to find a peaceful solution to the question. Nevertheless  the Comorian Government notes with some bitterness that no decision has as yet been taken on the French side which would show evidence on the part of the French authorities of a desire to find a solution to the problem. Since his accession to the High Court  President Said Mohamed Djohar  with the support of his government  has reaffirmed his desire and resolve to persevere in seeking a solution to the problem of Mayotte  while respecting the law. As they are convinced of the correctness of their claims  the people and the Government of Comoros continue to believe that Mayotte is part of Comorian territory and nothing can undermine their will to work for the reintegration of this land into the Comoros. Hence the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros hopes that it will always be able to rely on the valuable support of the international community to find a prompt solution to this dispute. This assistance is essential if the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros is to regain its territorial integrity and its unity  which are based on ethnogeographical  linguistic  religious  cultural and economic givens  even though ours is an island country. Over and above the policy of economic and financial recovery that has been implemented in the Comoros  my country has resolutely embarked on a process of democratization that has culminated in the adoption of a new Constitution on 7 June this year. In a month's time  the Comorian people is to elect the representatives to the national assembly and to the regional councils and the governors of the islands. Need I recall that the twofold effort of Said Mohamed Djohar and his Government to ensure  firstly  economic and financial recovery and  secondly  to establish democracy  is a major undertaking that requires the necessary conditions to be met for it to succeed. I therefore appeal to the international community to lend its most valuable support to our young democracy. When the San Francisco Charter was adopted  the principal goal of the prime movers of our Organization was to seek ways and means to build  for all nations  a future of peace  progress and justice. Today  this vision of the founding fathers  given the new international relations scene  has the ideal framework for it to be made reality. We therefore must give the United Nations our support  and give it the necessary means  to enable it properly to carry out the mission that has been assigned to it. In conclusion  I reiterate that the Comoros is confident that our Organization can resolve all the problems  of whatever kind  that afflict our world. What is needed here is that States should have the will to contribute to achieving this noble goal. "
"37",1607,"CPV",47,1992,"I should like to begin by congratulating Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am certain that under his guidance this session will prove to be a very fruitful one. To your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  I would like to express my delegation's appreciation for the manner in which he conducted the work of the forty-sixth session and for his personal efforts to strengthen the role of the General Assembly. The election of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  is of particular satisfaction to Cape Verde. I am certain that  under his leadership  the Organization will be able to face its responsibilities at a moment when fundamental changes are taking place in the world arena towards a more just order and the aspirations of mankind. I welcome the 13 new Members of the Organization recently admitted and am certain that their admission will enrich our collective dialogue in the search for solutions to the international problems that affect us all. The principle of universality of the United Nations has thus gained more expression. I hope that countries still under foreign occupation will  in the not-too-distant future  also join the community of nations represented here. Among the countries still under colonial occupation is East Timor. Historical and cultural ties link us with the people of that Territory under foreign occupation. My country sincerely hopes the ongoing negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the Secretary-General  as mandated by the General Assembly  will produce positive results which will make it possible in the near future for the people of East Timor to exercise its inalienable right to self-determination. The Assembly welcomed with enthusiasm the end of the cold war which put an end to the spectre of a nuclear holocaust and the policies of bloc rivalry. Cape Verde  together with many other countries  has great hopes for the new era announced by the end of the cold war. We hope that this new era will be dominated by peace ‚Äûn the world  cooperation among countries  global respect for human rights and democratic values and by renewed efforts in the field of economic development. If  on the one hand  the end of the cold war has given rise to an international political environment of great optimism concerning our collective future  it has  on the other  allowed conflicts to come into the open  the negative effects of which are of great concern to us all consuming  as they do  energies and resources so necessary to the economic and social development of countries a prerequisite for peoples to attain their aspirations for progress and well-being. The redefinition of the political geography and the newly institutionalized democracies in Eastern Europe are  without doubt  a political event of major magnitude  the positive effects of which on the international scene are already being felt. Nevertheless  the open conflicts which seem to proliferate in that part of the world give rise to serious concern about their negative impact on regional and global stability. Similarly  the political movements towards the creation of democratic governments in many parts of the world  mainly in Africa  while anticipating the emergence of a new order: in the existence of nations based upon democratic Pluralism  the participation of populations in running their countries and the affirmation of and respect for the fundamental rights of the citizenry  are also sometimes accompanied by internal political convulsions and conflicts. Thus present international relations are dominated by the optimism and hopes for a better future for us all brought about by these changes and  at the same time  by the current political realities where armed confrontations seem to take hold. The tragic situation in Somalia is a blatant example of the many national conflicts that are ravaging the world. I believe that national conflicts such as the one in Somalia  deserve our full attention  bearing in mind the dimension of the loss of human lives  the destruction of property they entail and the repercussions they have on regional and international peace and stability. The United Nations should assist those affected countries in the humanitarian field as well as in helping them to regain their internal political harmony and to bring about a normalization of the situation. I hope that in the case of Somalia all political forces will extend their full cooperation to the United Nations in facilitating the distribution of humanitarian assistance to the affected population. My country condemns any resistance or opposition to the deployment of United Nations forces in Somalia  whose presence becomes necessary for the massive provision of humanitarian assistance. I hope that the United Nations will proceed to the early deployment of an additional 3 000 United Nations guards to Somalia in view of the urgency of the situation. What is at stake here is the survival of the population of Somalia. Each day that passes without humanitarian assistance represents the loss of innumerable lives. The United Nations should stand firm in the implementation of its deployment decision  even in the face of the opposition of certain factions. The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is an example of the unfortunate reality that we are witnessing today  in which many conflicts seem to take hold despite attempts at peaceful negotiation. Notwithstanding the enormous efforts already made in various bodies  including the Security Council  to put an end to the conflict that is raging in the territory of the former Yugoslavia  and that has affected in particular the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  no tangible and lasting result has been achieved so far. For reasons having to do with peace and political stability in a region as important for international security as Europe  and also with the respect that the humanitarian situation deserves from all of us  the international community should make renewed efforts to bring about peace and normality in that country. In this context  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) can and should play a positive role. Everyone should strictly abide by the principle of territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The internal conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina requires a solution involving respect for the equal rights of all its citizens. The basis of that solution should be satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of the country's different communities. Against this background  my country hopes that the ongoing peace conference co-sponsored by the United Nations and the European Economic Community will produce satisfactory results in the very near future. The armed confrontations that today seem to be occurring everywhere call for a strong and more effective United Nations handling of its responsibilities in the maintenance of peace and stability. This important role of the United Nations takes on particular importance as an indispensable guarantee of the preservation of the independence  territorial integrity and security of smaller nations. It is incumbent upon the Security Council to carry out this primary responsibility of the United Nations in a speedy  efficient  coherent  impartial and unequivocal manner  whoever the participants in a conflict might be and wherever it might take place. In this connection  I should like to emphasize the relevance of the proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  with a view to strengthening the United Nations intervention capacity in the prevention and management of international crises. These proposals deserve careful consideration. My delegation will make its contribution to their analysis in the appropriate forum. The seriousness of the issues of international peace and security require careful consideration of these proposals  with a view to their early implementation. The Assembly should exert every effort to make the affirmation of and respect for human rights in all their different dimensions a priority issue on its agenda. The repeated violation of fundamental rights in various countries is still a reality that the community of nations cannot tolerate. Every effort should be made to eliminate the abuses that are still being committed in various parts of the world against the dignity of human beings and their basic human rights. While recognizing the multifaceted dimension of human rights  my delegation does not share the functionalist approach to this question. Indeed  fundamental rights and individual liberties are fundamental to the dignity of human beings and should therefore be asserted unconditionally- Jt is in this context that my country has advocated strengthening and improving United Nations mechanisms for the protection of human rights whenever their violation  by its dimension and degree  becomes intolerable. Whenever United Nations action to protect human rights comes into conflict with the principles of sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  we should face the issue with the necessary courage and imagination to find a middle-ground approach. I should like in this connection to emphasize my country's concern about the practices of xenophobia and racism in certain countries. Cape Verde takes pride in receiving foreigners in its midst. It is therefore difficult for us to understand the surge of hatred and violence against foreign nationals and migrant workers in certain countries. A large part of my country's population works and resides abroad. Migration is today a universal phenomenon that in a way involves all countries. It is the expression of solidarity among groups and their ability to live in peace with one another  irrespective of their origin or race. Firm measures should be taken in the receiving countries against those engaged in such shameful practices  for they run counter to the basic rules of the civilized world that we all wish to build. The economic situation of the developing countries has not improved  notwithstanding national efforts. The precarious economic situation in which these countries find themselves plays a negative role in the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and offers fertile ground for the resurgence of conflict  which not only poisons social harmony  but also disturbs the peace and security of States. In the past  responding to appeals for economic assistance for developing nations could be seen as the expression of a mere act of human solidarity  but today it is clear that the need to engage all countries  developed and developing  in addressing the problems of underdevelopment represents a global interest that we all have in the creation of objective conditions that will facilitate the internal stability of nations and their harmonious relationship. The problem of underdevelopment is thus today a global concern shared by all those interested in the stability and ecological balance of the world. Therefore the solution of this problem should be found by both developed and developing countries  together. This economic situation becomes even more fragile for the developing countries that are affected by drought and desertification. Africa is the continent most affected in this regard. The enormous dimensions that drought and desertification has assumed in the world and the catastrophic effects it has had on many developing countries and the well-being of their population requires a global plan to face this calamity successfully. In this regard  it is to be hoped that the decision of the Rio Conference to establish an inter-governmental committee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification will be implemented in the course of this session of the General Assembly. As a country that is seriously affected by drought and desertification. Cape Verde expects the negotiation of such a legal instrument to be crowned with success and its early entry into force to be a landmark in the struggle against this serious problem. Similarly  it is hoped that the important decisions taken at the Rio Conference will have positive follow-up. The time has come for us to show with deeds that this Conference represented a break with a past of environmental negligence. Let us hope that it will represent the beginning of a new attitude on the part of Governments and a new spirit of shared responsibilities and international solidarity in the creation of a healthier and ecologically more sound world  a world economically more interdependent and morally more just. The world goes through political  economic and social changes of major magnitude. The United Nations  as a permanent conference where economic  political and social issues are discussed  should reflect such changes in its own structures and procedures so that it may fulfil its potential and strengthen its capacity in dealing with the ever increasing and diversified challenges. In this regard the efforts being made to streamline the work of the United Nations and rationalize its activities are undoubtedly commendable and deserve our support. The ""Agenda for peace"" presented by the Secretary-General following the Security Council summit held in January of this year is a solid basis for reflection on issues related to United Nations reform. It is to be hoped that the useful ideas contained therein will be further developed in the ongoing dialogue on the adjustment of the United Nations to today's needs. This necessity for adjustment is already felt even at the level of certain United Nations organs. In fact  the activity of the General Assembly has been seen lately as having lost certain importance  and its prestige has been affected. As the most important organ of the United Nations  where the voices of all member countries are heard  it is important that this Assembly  which is the expression of the democratic character of this Organization  find ways to reactivate its activities and restore its lost prestige. In our view there are different means through which to strengthen the role of the General Assembly. The consideration of measures to rationalize the work of the General Assembly is one such means. Rationalization should touch upon redesigning its agenda and reconsideration of its procedures  including restructuring the debate in the plenary and in the different committees  to avoid unnecessary overlapping and repetition. On the other hand  it is important that whenever an item on its agenda assumes global relevance and generates universal interest it should be considered in the General Assembly itself instead of being transferred for consideration as autonomous subject-matter in an international conference. Lately voices have frequently been heard on the need to enlarge the Security Council membership. We believe that this issue should be tackled in the light of the necessity of adapting this organ to the correlation of forces prevalent in the world today. Equally important is the necessity of taking into consideration a relative balance in the representation in the Council of different regions. Whatever the outcome  however  enlargement of the Security Council should in no way take place at the expense of the effectiveness of the decisions that that important body is called upon to take on issues of peace and security. On the other hand  the ongoing efforts to streamline the work of the Economic and Social Council should improve the co-ordination of the activities of different bodies dealing with economic and social issues  due account being taken  obviously  of the necessity of preserving the required decentralization and the specific nature of the functions of those bodies. We welcome the decision of the Secretary-General to proceed to an in-depth study on the modalities for that restructuring. Ours is an era of armed confrontation and profound changes in the international scene. But it is equally an era that offers a unique opportunity and exceptional conditions that nurture great expectations and hope in the shaping of a better and more peaceful relationship between nations aimed at building a collective future of peace and well-being. Tolerance  a spirit of solidarity and the promotion of universal values should guide us in the shaping of this collective future. It is incumbent upon us all  small countries and big as well  developed and developing nations  to understand the sense of our community of interest and to take the necessary steps towards that end.

"38",1652,"CRI",47,1992,"Costa Rica took great pleasure in supporting the election of Mr. Stoyan Ganev to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His election bears witness to a new era in the history of Bulgaria  an era of freedom and pluralistic democracy. My delegation sincerely congratulates the Secretary-General on his masterful guidance of the work of the United Nations. Under his leadership the Organization is with ever greater vigour assuming the central role that it should play in international affairs. Costa Rica warmly welcomes all the new Members of the United Nations. Their presence in this Hall symbolizes the birth of a new era in international relations based on the ideals of peace and freedom and cooperation between all peoples. Mankind has seen the threat of nuclear holocaust lifted; it has seen the East-West ideological and military confrontation fade. But super-Power confrontation has been replaced  quickly and bloodily  by conflicts whose seemingly lesser magnitude does not make them any the less dangerous to world peace. The outbreak for the most absurd reasons of a number of conventional wars confirms our belief that it is more important than ever to make progress in the field of disarmament. The end of the East-West conflict provides a unique opportunity to make decisive advances in that sphere and to impose strict controls on the arms trade. The fading of the nuclear threat must not take us back to the era of continuous war. Old sins cast long shadows. Today  as in 1914  we look with dismay at events in the Balkans. A State Member of the United Nations  Bosnia and Herzegovina  is fighting for survival in the midst of a bloody and unjustifiable war. Peace initiatives fail one after the other. A final solution to this senseless holocaust is not yet in sight. Costa Rica is deeply concerned at the dimensions this regional European conflict is taking on  and at the number of innocent victims  which grows daily. The international community reacts tepidly  and  incomprehensibly  is reluctant to take the firm and vigorous stand that returned sovereignty to Kuwait. How many thousands of deaths must there be for a conflict to be worthy of international interest? The case of Somalia reveals how far we still have to go before we can truly speak of a family of united nations. The conflict in Somalia did not command our interest until 2 million people were about to die of hunger and our consciences were struck by the terrible images of Somali children begging for food. Regrettably the tragedy of Somalia is only the most terrible aspect of the tragedy of sub-Saharan Africa  which is suffering a slow death of despair  hunger  poverty and underdevelopment and is met with the indifference of the community of nations. The end of the cold war has not decreased the depth of the abyss between north and south; indeed  it increases daily with technological advances. Third world countries not only do not receive an adequate response to their needs and expectations  but are witnessing a reduction in outlets for their products and in financial aid for development. The stagnation of the Uruguay Round  the increase in protective measures adopted by industrialized nations  and the reductions in development programmes are  oddly  occurring at a time when Latin America has become a continent of democracies and when many African and Asian countries have again taken the road to civil and political liberty. Some regrettable steps backwards have already been taken. Latin American democracy has suffered severe setbacks in Peru and Haiti. In Peru there seems to be movement towards a solution  despite the fact that the country is still overrun by the irrationality of terrorism and the worst economic situation in its history. In contrast  the problem in Haiti  the poorest and most underdeveloped country in the Americas  grows worse every day. Because Costa Rica belongs to the Caribbean  Haiti's tragedy is of special concern to us. My country believes that both the United Nations and the regional organizations should pay more attention to this matter and strive harder for a prompt solution to the crisis. We are not talking about the legitimacy of a president or a government  but about the right of a sister nation to live in freedom and receive the cooperation it desperately needs for its development. I have mentioned only two examples  but I believe they are dramatically representative. An overwhelming majority of third world democracies are still on the road to consolidation. This consolidation will be difficult  however  without a substantial improvement in their economic and social conditions  which in turn requires that developed countries change their attitude in respect to opening their markets and increasing their cooperation. It need hardly be said that the worse the conditions become in third world countries  the greater will be the number of legal or illegal immigrants to developed countries  despite the ethnocentric  racist movements which  shamefully in this era  are again on the rise. Needless to say  the third world countries must do their part too. International cooperation  regardless of its magnitude  will not change the situation of the receiving country if it does not exert a disciplined and determined effort to make progress. It is no secret that in many cases financial aid intended for development has been misspent on unproductive and grandiose projects. It has been used to pay salaries and has even been placed in personal bank accounts. Meanwhile  the people continue to suffer hunger and poverty. Therefore if cooperation with the underdeveloped countries is to increase  those countries must fight harder against bureaucracy and administrative corruption and must redouble their efforts to ensure that international aid truly fulfils its objectives. At a time when the economic situation is difficult even for many industrialized nations  and when the European Community is undergoing one of the worst monetary crises of its history  priority should also be given to increasing South-South cooperation. Each of us has something to give and something to receive. The common condition of third world countries does not prevent us from recognizing that there are many stages of development and many possibilities for cooperation. Moreover  the growing importance of integration institutions offers a great opportunity to intensify the levels of interregional cooperation by means of effective and coordinated actions which will contribute to fortifying the democratic system through economic and social progress. Costa Rica wishes to stress the efforts to ensure coordination and cooperation being made by the countries of Latin America; they clearly show the region's determination to resolve differences through the use of machinery for peaceful settlement established in international law. In this connection  my Government congratulates El Salvador and Honduras on completing their case before the International Court of Justice  making it possible to settle their border conflict. At the same time  we express our satisfaction with the efforts being made by Ecuador and Peru to find a just and final solution to the bilateral border dispute which for so many years has existed between these two fraternal countries. Democracy can flourish only if electoral pluralism is combined with respect for human rights. Costa Rica assigns primary importance to these rights  which for many years now we have made the foundation for both our internal life and our external policies. Consequently  my country takes a great interest in the World Conference on Human Rights  scheduled to be held in Vienna next year  and we are very happy to serve as the site of the preparatory meeting for the Latin American and Caribbean region. We are also pleased to know that during the Vienna Conference some countries will discuss the possibility of creating the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Costa Rica has submitted this idea to the General Assembly repeatedly since the 1970s  and we firmly hope that it will finally take shape at the World Conference. My delegation also wishes to express Costa Rica's firm support for the mechanism established by the Economic and Social Council in 1991 to allow the Commission on Human Rights to hold special sessions to take up serious violations of fundamental rights. We deem it necessary to continue the search for flexible machinery which will stop and prevent massive violations of human rights in a timely manner. We should like to recall here the Costa Rican proposal - approved by the Human Rights Committee at the beginning of this year for a treaty on prevention of torture. The negotiations on the complex problems of South Africa and the Middle East are doubtless of great importance to the cause of human rights. In this and other forums my country has rigorously condemned the apartheid regime  an offensive and unjustifiable anachronism that deprives the majority of the South African people of their fundamental rights. We have welcomed  with optimism  the beginning of negotiations between the Pretoria regime and the African National Congress  and we firmly hope that  leaving aside the reprehensible acts that have occurred in Ciskei and other parts of South Africa  the renewed peace talks will soon lead to the construction of a new  democratic and peace-loving South Africa that will work towards the development of the entire continent. Costa Rica urges that resolute steps be taken in that direction. The need for long-lasting peace in the Middle East has been a matter of constant concern to the United Nations almost ever since it was established. Now  for the first time in the eventful history of this region  effective peace talks are taking place with the participation of all interested parties. Nevertheless  it is my Government's opinion that this process should move faster and should be accompanied by a substantial improvement in the human rights situation in the Middle East without distinction as to race  nationality or religious creed. It is important that in this case  as in many other cases  the international community should contribute  in a vigilant manner  to promoting peace and assuring respect for the fundamental rights of individuals and communities. Peace is possible regardless of the number of human lives lost in a conflict or of how much damage has been caused. Human beings are capable of forgetting extremism and of talking with their opponents when the future of their children is at stake. The recent history of Central America is vivid Proof that a cruel and lengthy conflict can be stopped by means of negotiation. During the 1980s  Central America suffered an unprecedented political and security crisis marked by intimations of totalitarism and by guerrilla activity  flows of refugees  an arms buildup  the destruction of infrastructure and an alarming extension of the East-West confrontation. Fortunately  today most of these features belong to the past. Democracy and political freedom reign in all the Central American countries  several national reconciliation processes are at present under way  arms limitation talks are moving ahead and a vigorous effort for integration is in progress. Nevertheless  the experience of Central America also shows the international community that it is very difficult to consolidate advances achieved in matters relating to peace and democracy if the underlying reality of underdevelopment and poverty continues to exist. The democratic and peaceful Central America of today has seen the world lose interest in its problems. It has witnessed a decline in the cooperation that existed when it was in turmoil. The Latin American peoples' effort to change their destiny has collided with the increasing indifference of the developed nations. Financial aid is being reduced. Coffee and bananas  our leading export products  are encountering more and more obstacles. We are being urged to diversify our production  but international markets are not opening up to us. Central America is being urged to advance towards democracy without our being given the tools that will lead us to development. Political democracy alone  regrettably  is not a panacea for the social problems of our countries. It is true that it is possible to live in democracy even with poverty  but in countries that have just started to experience democracy  democracy will not sink its roots very deep if it is not accompanied by improvements in nutrition  housing and public health. It is not possible to approach most of the subjects being discussed here  including international cooperation  from one point of view alone. The present international situation is an especially promising opportunity for all nations  regardless of their resources  to work in a coordinated manner to combat common enemies and to build a better world for our children. This plurality of vision is  for example  the only way to confront  with any prospect of success  the problem of drug trafficking and production  which is harmful to producing and consumer countries alike  and is aggravated by the accompanying terrorism and guerrilla warfare. Unquestionably  the most important problem we must face as a species is that of saving the planet's ecological  economic and social integrity  for ourselves and for future generations. Costa Rica  which has been a victim  like many other countries  of the irrational destruction and exploitation of its national resources  has reconsidered and now emphasizes the need for a new international ecological order that will save mankind from its progressive environmental suicide and reorient the course of its development. I am very pleased to announce to this Assembly that  in accordance with Costa Rica's offer of 3 September to set up  in the capital city of my country  the organizing committee of the Earth Council  a non-governmental organization that will supplement and support governmental follow-up of the Rio agreements. The Rio Conference  regardless of all its limitations  is a magnificent landmark in the fight against environmental degradation and unsustainable development patterns. But how much has really been done to put into effect what was agreed there? Will we limit ourselves to regarding the Rio Conference as a kind of community of ecological nations packed with fine-sounding words and good intentions but lacking results? The triumph of ecological degradation creates only losers. Safeguarding the environment  sustainable development and the struggle against poverty are joint responsibilities of both the industrialized and the underdeveloped world. Hence the United Nations is an ideal forum for making efforts in that direction  for demanding compliance with the Rio resolutions and for imposing sanctions on those Members that disregard them. While there are mechanisms for collective international action to combat threats to international peace and security  there should also be  within the United Nations  procedures for acting against those who endanger human survival  the planet's resources and social justice  and for imposing sanctions against them. As the Secretary-General has stated  the question of world peace  stability and security should include subjects other than military matters. It is logical  then  that the changes that have taken place in the world and the new realities being encountered by mankind today make it imperative for the United Nations  a pillar of the joint efforts of nations  to reorganize in order to fulfil its important mission more effectively. From this perspective  my country considers it indispensable that the United Nations should comply fully with the principle of universality and open its doors to those who  for various reasons  have been forced to remain outside it. Of special concern to us is the case of the Republic of China in Taiwan  a democratic community of 21 million people with a brilliant economic development record whose reality cannot continue to be ignored by an Organization that takes pride in having gone beyond the patterns of the cold war. In addition  it is imperative that the structures and procedures of the United Nations be revised to conform with the realities of our times. The Secretary-General  in his outstanding report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  has written with commendable accuracy about the most important aspects which need to be modified in a relatively short period of time. Costa Rica wishes today to declare that it shares most of the concerns stated in that document and urges all Member States to begin a vigorous effort for institutional renewal. One of the most important areas that should be revised is the Security Council  in terms of its make-up and objectives. We believe that the number of permanent members should be increased  in accordance with the new realities of the international scene  and based on better and greater geographical representation. We also deem it necessary to reconsider the institution of the veto and reflect upon the corresponding role of the Council in maintaining world peace and security  as well as its relationship to the General Assembly. Some thought should also be given to strengthening  modernizing and reducing bureaucracy in the Economic and Social Council. This is a good time also to mention the importance of coordination between the United Nations and other international forums. Regardless of the inevitable difficulties  the integration movement continues apace in Europe  Asia  South America and Central America. We the Central Americans  joined by democracy in all our countries  have reconsidered our outmoded system of integration to adapt it to the new regional realities  and only a few months ago the Treaty that establishes  on a new basis  the Central American Integration System came into force. Costa Rica is confident that this new organization will become the arena for persistent efforts towards our shared future and in keeping with the Secretary-General's proposal  it will shortly be in a position to request observer status in the United Nations. In a few days the anniversary of the meeting of two hemispheres the meeting of the whole world with itself - will be celebrated. Since the dawn of that day  a Friday in October  mankind was able to start thinking with a sense of family and of inevitable common destiny. Now  on the threshold of the third millennium  that unavoidable mission of mankind is stronger than ever before  and the United Nations is its most important embodiment. Here at the United Nations  and in everyone's country and in everyone's home  the wise words of sura XXVIII of the Holy Koran hold true: ""... [Do not] forget thy portion in this World: but do thou good. As God has been good To thee ... ""That Home of the Hereafter We shall give to those Who intend not high-handedness Or mischief on earth: And the End is (best) For the righteous."" (The Holy Koran. XXVIII:77.83) "
"39",1698,"CSK",47,1992,"Let me congratulate you. Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. I wish you much success and promise you full support. I thank your predecessor  Mr. Shihabi  for guiding the General Assembly to success at its forth-sixth session. The past year weakened further the illusion that the end of the cold war would facilitate a speedy and effective solution of problems that built up during the post-war period. It has been a sobering year  during which we have been involved in the gradual process of getting acquainted with the possible. Sometimes we see euphoria replaced by total pessimism and little faith. While the era of bipolarity is over and democracy is winning  many conflicts remain unresolved  and a new generation of conflicts is beginning. In addition to conflicts with which we have dealt routinely  but unsuccessfully  over the years  we are now witnessing a great variety of wars. The number of zones of conflict gets larger and larger. Nagorno-Karabakh  Transnistria  South Ossetia  Abkhazia and Bosnia and Herzegovina mainly Bosnia and Herzegovina - are new symbols of violence to which we have no answers. The United Nations  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  the European Communities  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the Western European Union (WEU) and the Council of Europe are unable  despite all their commendable efforts  to exert sufficient pressure to secure the desired solutions to these tragedies. In this respect  there has been growing impatience and anxiety  as well as dissatisfaction and criticism  on the part of the public and the mass media. It has become routine to question the role of international institutions as instruments that are suitable for conflict management. Let us be frank about this: we face a problem of credibility. Much will be at stake if we fail to deal immediately with it.* There is a risk that a very typical challenge of the 1990s the relationship between statehood and nationhood will become a phenomenon of world politics that defies efficient international regulation. In this respect in particular  international institutions have a fundamental role to play in providing a guarantee that the processes will develop on a basis of democracy and of respect for universal and civilized human values. However  it would be a mistake to start the search for solutions by challenging international institutions as such. It would be a mistake to decide to modify the United Nations radically and rebuild it by rejecting the wisdom of its founding fathers  as embodied in the Charter. The claim that revitalization of the United Nations requires not a change in the Charter but  on the contrary  full implementation of the Charter is often considered to be a cliche. I regard it not as a cliche but as a wise approach  indicating not rigidity but  rather  a willingness to exploit fully the political potential of the Charter. It is true that the Charter makes no explicit reference to drugs  organized crime  the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  indebtedness or the widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. However  it contains fundamental political principles on the basis of which these problems can and should be solved. To that end  the things that are lacking are sometimes instruments  sometimes money and very often the political will. What is needed is - in short - a change in our approach to the priorities of the activities of the Organization. It is in this climate that the Secretary-General's report the ""Agenda for Peace"" - has come into our hands. The recommendations contained in that report provide useful guidelines for effective exploitation of the Charter's potential. I believe that the section dealing with the prevention of conflict requires elaboration  as it has been demonstrated that activity in this field will increasingly become one of the basic orientations of multilateral diplomacy. In summary  the Secretary-General's report deals with confidence-building measures  fact-finding  early warning and preventive diplomacy. I am familiar with these terms as the CSCE  at its third summit  held in Helsinki  firmly incorporated them into the list of its instruments. Mention of the CSCE brings me to a question that Czechoslovakia has proposed as a new item for the General Assembly's agenda - coordination of the activities of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. In this connection  let me take the former Yugoslavia as an example. Several times  in my capacity as Chairman of the CSCE Council of Ministers  I have come across situations in which activities of the United Nations and activities of the CSCE overlap. Naturally  such overlapping has reduced the effectiveness of those activities. My meetings with Tadeusz Mazowiecki  the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the former Yugoslavia  clearly demonstrated a need for  and an interest in  regular coordination of United missions with those of the CSCE. In this connection  I should say that the United Nations made an excellent choice when it picked Mr. Mazowiecki for its human-rights activities in this explosive area. However  this problem does not concern just the former Yugoslavia. Like the CSCE  the United Nations has sent missions to Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria. As the aims of all these missions have been coordinated only in outline  it is no wonder that the parties to the conflict often fail to understand the purpose of these foreign delegations coming to see them and asking the same questions. It is often unclear how they differ. The CSCE summit that took place in Helsinki in July laid the basis for improved cooperation between the United Nations and the CSCE  as well as other other organizations NATO  the Western European Union (WEU) and the Council of Europe. The need for such interaction resulted in the London Conference on the former Yugoslavia. This was the first example of systematic cooperation between three international organizations  and it amounted to the first interlocking action by the European Community  the United Nations and the CSCE. As the London Conference was attended also by the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the International Red Cross as a non-governmental organization  I see it as the germ of a loose system of cooperation between various institutions. It seems to me that the time is right to consider seriously the convening of an informal ""brainstorming"" meeting of the United Nations  the CSCE  the European Community  NATO  the WEU and the Council of Europe to discuss the idea of an interlocking system of international organizations. The purpose of the proposed General Assembly agenda item on coordination between the United Nations and the CSCE is not simply to secure a resolution. In my opinion  that discussion of the issue at this session could develop at two levels - the conceptual level  at which the fundamental political meaning of coordination  both in the immediate future and in the light of medium-term and long-term prospects  could be clarified; and the practical level  at which the activities of the two institutions have already begun to overlap  making it possible to draw conclusions. It will certainly be in the interests of the United Nations and of the CSCE to have the meaning of ""preventive diplomacy"" and ""early warning"" clarified. These terms have already taken on a very definite meaning at the CSCE  and the majority of United Nations Member States  as they do not participate in the CSCE  will probably want to become acquainted with them. The conceptual discussion might focus also on the relationship between the United Nations and the CSCE as institutions each of which has the task of looking after the security of its members. This is especially so as the CSCE now covers an area stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. For the purpose of getting the discussion under way  I should like  in my national capacity  to put forward some ideas. Whenever the Security Council wishes to discuss a security issue within the competence of the CSCE  a representative of the CSCE should be invited to provide the Council with the necessary information on any CSCE activities in respect of that issue or otherwise to contribute to the work of the Council. The Council and its President  as well as the United Nations Secretary-General  should be kept constantly informed of the main activities of the CSCE  and the reverse should apply. Coordination of the human-rights activities of the United Nations and of the CSCE could be improved by  for example  regular CSCE participation at meetings of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and its committees  the Economic and Social Council and the Third Committee of the General Assembly. And is there any reason why we should not establish working contacts between the United Nations Centre for Human Rights in Geneva and the CSCE's Warsaw Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights? In addition  one of the main elements of the CSCE's early-warning system the High Commissioner on National Minorities might have some link with the United Nations. Indeed  at the appropriate time  that might even be turned into an institutional link. In the long term  the CSCE human-rights institutions  structures and mechanisms could become tools of both the United Nations and the Council of Europe. Such discussion as I have suggested could dispel the fear of United Nations Member States which do not participate in the CSCE that the Helsinki process is an elite club that institutionalizes the gap between the rich North and the poor South. We must also ensure that there is a proper understanding of the peace-keeping role of the CSCE vis-a-vis that of the United Nations. The most recent reason for this comparison is to be found in President Bush's statement to the General Assembly on Monday  in which he suggested that the peace-keeping function of the United Nations should be expanded considerably. The peace-keeping concept of the United Nations is not identical to that of the CSCE  and I believe that there is a good prospect of their becoming complementary. It should be remembered that  in this respect  the North Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union have made important offers. It is unlikely that we shall be able to avoid having a debate on peacemaking and peace-keeping. The crisis in the former Yugoslavia necessitates a really serious discussion of this question. It is unnecessary for me to reiterate my country's full support for the United Nations peace-keeping operations  as there are Czech and Slovak ""blue helmets"" in the former Yugoslavia  and Czechoslovakia has contributed to the United Nations operations in Angola  Somalia and Iraq. To be of practical benefit  discussion of the interaction between the United Nations and the CSCE should take place annually. In today's world the United Nations can play an even more important role in arms control and disarmament. I am thinking especially of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction. When the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms becomes operational  it will have a substantial role to play. The Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  says  ""globalism and nationalism need not be viewed as opposing trends"" (para. 19). These words attracted my attention as they reflect one of the peculiarities of our times. They embody the historical experience of the two nations of Czechoslovakia experience that I should like to share with members. The idea of the right of nations to self-determination advanced by President Wilson facilitated the disintegration of the former Austro-Hungarian monarchy  thus opening up the way for the creation of Czechoslovakia. That was 74 years ago. Czechoslovakia emerged  however  under the influence of the notion that there was a Czechoslovak nation  whereas it should have been admitted that there were two distinct nations the Czechs and the Slovaks. But the idea of Czechoslovakism  which resulted in the creation of a common State for the world's two closest Slavic nations  impeded relations between those nations. Thus a specific Czecho-Slovak problem was born  and it remains unresolved. At about the same time  communism tied nations together by means of the false idea of proletarian internationalism. This was bound to affect relations between the Czechs and the Slovaks. However  our experience indicates that communism was not the root of these problems; it simply gave them a new dimension. Many nations are now searching for a new role in Europe and in the world by seeking integration into larger economic entities and political groups. I believe that  so far as Czechoslovakia is concerned  one possible solution lies in the replacement of the existing federalist pattern by new ties. Understanding and viable coexistence between nations cannot be based on false and outdated ideas. Czechoslovakia is therefore preparing to establish two closely connected sovereign States by creating a common economy space and retaining intact the close contacts between the peoples of the two republics. We want to introduce elements of European integration into the relations between the republics. What is now taking place in Czechoslovakia is a process aimed at the creation of a solid basis for a model of integration such as has been developing democratically in Western Europe and has led to the creation and development of the European Communities. minim Globalism and nationalism are not necessarily opposing trends  provided that the right to self-determination is accompanied by the desire for closer cooperation with other nations and by efficient participation in international systems of guaranteeing the basic values upon which the world and especially the fragile structure of peace are built. We live in an era of global integration comprising different subsystems  among which the United Nations has an irreplaceable role to play. I should like  in conclusion  to say that this statement is a sort of farewell speech of the Czechoslovak federation to the United Nations. It is highly probable that by January of next year the federation will have ceased to exist. Thus one of the founding members of the United Nations will give its place in international politics to the two new independent States. It is my hope that all the current Members of the United Nations will extend to the Czech republic and the Slovak republic the understanding that they have always shown to Czechoslovakia  by admitting them to membership as soon as possible. "
"40",1721,"CUB",47,1992,"I wish to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. He can be sure of the cooperation of the Cuban delegation. We shall soon be commemorating the five hundredth anniversary of the clash between two worlds and the beginning of an era that was to transform radically relations between nations. That dramatic and as yet unfinished piece of history started in the Caribbean Sea and forever left its mark upon the fate of the peoples of the area. Our deepest root  which gave us life as a nation and a place in history  is our rebelliousness. For centuries the Caribbean was the victim of the brutal greed of all sorts of intruders  the crossroads of slave-traders and pirates  of traffickers and invaders; violence and cruelty were its constant scourges. But it was also witness to the heroic resistance of its peoples  which time and again rose up  pushed by the powerful and anonymous force of the Caribbean winds  in their eagerness to achieve their freedom. While the plundering of its resources and the iniquitous exploitation of its people led the Caribbean to its encounter with the rest of the world  it was the struggle to abolish all kinds of servitude and to have no master other than our own conscience  which shaped our profound and irreducible identity and allowed us to discover ourselves. The Assembly is meeting at a crucial moment of definition. Today  as five centuries ago  we are faced with attempts to reshape the world and reorder relations between nations. Today  as in the past  the idea is to determine whether the future will allow human solidarity to flourish or whether it will still be weighed down by selfishness; whether it will one day lead to the emancipation of the dispossessed  or whether it will for ever perpetuate their tragedy; whether we are on the verge of a new colonizing adventure  or whether  at long last  hope will begin to emerge for the poor of this Earth. In recent years humanity has been surprised by a series of developments which have radically changed important elements of international relations and have led to an avalanche of hasty interpretations and conclusions promoted by the unrestrained haste of the privileged and the naive optimism of many others. The end of the cold war  and with it the lessening of the danger of a nuclear holocaust  should not be used to attempt to conceal what everyone knows. It is true that military confrontation between the super-Powers which threatened mankind with extermination never happened  and that the rancorous antagonism of yesteryear was transformed through the unilateral incantation of a baffling kind of alchemy into complacent subordination and a show of fondness. That that war never occurred is of course salutary and deserving of praise  but to identify with that fact the emergence of universal peace is an absurdity which can make sense only from the profoundly racist perspective of the new conquerors. The period which now seems to be coming to an end was for the third world a period of hard-fought struggles for independence and freedom. While threatening with a battle which never occurred  imperialists used all their means and resources to invade  attack  repress and oppress the peoples of the South; many of their sons and daughters fell in confrontations which had nothing to do with the rivalries between the powerful  and they died without knowing how that antagonism was to be transmuted into a bizarre convergence. Just as the existence of the cold war did not alter the fate of the third world  its disappearance does not  so far  seem to be benefiting its peoples. The previous balance of power that contained the opposing blocs and avoided a direct military conflict between them did not prevent the practice of war  aggression and intervention against the third world. We have no reason to imagine that the effects of the present conditions of unipolarity and hegemonism will be more favourable to our peoples. On the contrary  dangers are greater than ever in the face of a triumphant ecstasy on the part of those who are in possession not only of the largest military power but also of an insurmountable historical ignorance and the most gross moral callousness. The cold war is disappearing  but the arms race is not being reduced in parallel  nor are militarism and bellicose mentalities being abandoned. If the danger of war has been reduced  why does the United States aspire to continue developing its military superiority  as was recently announced by the occupant of the White House? Against whom will the empire now direct its weapons? We hear unending rhetoric about the end of confrontation and the beginning of a new era of international cooperation  but it seems to exist only in the imagination of those so gullible as to believe it. If a spirit of international cooperation does really exist and if the cold war has ended  why are the military expenditures of the big Powers not being drastically reduced and why are the resources thus released not being channelled to the promotion of development in underdeveloped countries? How can it be explained that now precisely now attempts are being made to reduce international cooperation for development to an even more subordinate and hypothetical role  further to diminish the already limited presence of the United Nations in that field and also to introduce unacceptable conditionalities and restrictions? The changes that have occurred between the countries of the North have no meaning for the majority of the inhabitants of the planet. If those changes are to make some sense for them  it is necessary to undertake decisive and effective action against the hunger and poverty which affect hundreds of millions of people in the third world; and against infant malnutrition and incurable diseases which are daily taking the lives of thousands of children in an ongoing and silent war that some choose to ignore. The economic crisis  the external debt of the third world  which has risen to the figure of $1.50 trillion  unequal exchange  and increased hunger and poverty have never been greater amongst the immense majority of mankind. Their effects are staggering even for the most solid economies of the world. Open subsidies and other selfish policies threaten to impede the conclusion of agreements which have been in course of negotiation for years to regulate international trade and which may provoke disastrous confrontations between the large economic Powers. This clearly demonstrates that the history of capitalism cannot escape its terrible and self-destructive laws. There is meagre cause for optimism at present  when many cannot even defy the consequences of recalling the principles of the new international economic order solemnly proclaimed by the Assembly in times that were supposedly less favourable for international cooperation. True  universal and durable peace will be possible only in a world full of hegemony  based on the rights  interests and aspirations of all peoples  in a world in which the purposes and principles of the San Francisco Charter will become a reality and  in particular  in a world which pays full respect to the sovereign equality of States  non-intervention and non-interference in the internal affairs of States  self-determination of peoples  and the right to development. But to achieve this  it is indispensable to democratize international relations and the United Nations  providing the Organization with the conditions necessary for it to fulfil the mission for which it should exist. The United Nations cannot be reduced to a simple instrument of domination by the powerful. Member States must prevent that; if they do not they would in practice be permitting its termination and the elimination of all possibility of achieving an equitable and peaceful world. We must not accept the Security Council's operating as a secret society  turning its back on the Organization which created it and in whose name it should be acting; we must not accept its assuming functions which it does not have and which no one has conferred upon it. The Security Council's composition  functions and modus operandi must be urgently examined in depth so that it can become a truly representative body  so that the anachronistic and anti-democratic veto privilege can be eliminated and transparency can be introduced into its activities  while limiting them strictly to those set down in the Charter  and so that it will fully respect the obligation enshrined in the Charter to be accountable to the General Assembly  which  in turn  should strictly fulfil its responsibility to exercise control over the Council. The Security Council has no authority whatsoever to interpret the Charter or to broaden the scope of its powers  or to carry out all the orders coming from its surreptitious informal gatherings. We must not tolerate the use of the Council by those who so frequently defile the ideals of democracy as an instrument for carrying out a virtual coup d'etat in the United Nations. Nor can we we allow ideas to take hold that would introduce the concept of limited sovereignty and promote the creation of mechanisms that would result in converting the Organization into a permanent source of intrusion  interference and intervention  to the benefit of the interests of the powerful. The Organization must be democratized in order to strengthen its role and enhance its efficiency. To that end  it is indispensable to reinforce  not to weaken  the responsibilities of the General Assembly as the sole body in which all of us have equal responsibilities and which therefore has the capacity to represent the international community as a whole. During the tenth summit conference that we held at Jakarta early this month  the non-aligned countries adopted a common platform to face the present international situation and to ensure concerted action in the United Nations. The Jakarta Message  the Final Document and the resolutions that were adopted should become our tools to mobilize the third world in defence of its rights and to organize our resistance to those who are attempting to impose a self-styled new world order  which was conceived against  and without taking into account the interests of  the peoples of the South and which would constitute nothing but the installation on a global scale of the kind of hegemonistic delusions upon the cinders of which this Organization was created. The aims of those who are concocting the reorganization of the world  with a view to dominating it  are becoming increasingly obvious. Underdevelopment and poverty would be permanently reserved for the peoples of the South  which constitute three quarters of humankind  and they would continue to be the providers of wealth for the affluent minorities of the North. International bodies would be converted into mechanisms for domination and intervention to guarantee a world system where the powerful would impose their corrupted ideas and values. The new conquerors are not bearers of the cross; rather  they brandish the sword and the moneybag  and the only gospel they preach is profits. Cynically they proclaim themselves the representatives of a superior society and they go so far as to attempt to present themselves as the very image of democracy  freedom and human rights. With the same arrogance shown by their colonialist ancestors  with the same haughtiness shown by their fascist inspirers  today's hegemonists boast about the alleged superiority of their societies  their way of life  their ideas  beliefs and values  and use every means in attempting to impose them upon other peoples. They are attempting to impose not only their ideas  but also their ""justice""  which lacks the slightest equity and which  even within the territory of the United States  and with an openly racist point of view  pronounces the harshest sentences  including the death penalty  on  almost exclusively  blacks and hispanics. What is the sense of  and how can we condone  the decision of that country's Supreme Court which legalized the right to kidnap anyone of any nationality in any part of the world? Has mankind ever seen such an abuse of power and high-handedness at any other stage in its history? At the same time  encouraged by the setbacks of European socialism  they are trying to decree the end of socialist ideals and to impose capitalism  in its most uncontrolled fashion  as the sole  definitive and permanent model to be applied around the world. They proclaim the so-called neo-liberal formulas as dogma which everyone must observe and they do not even blush when they portray themselves as having the exclusive recipe for mankind's prosperity and happiness. Millions of dollars that could be devoted to more noble purposes are being spent today in selling those ideas. But the peoples of the third world have not forgotten that it was the unrestrained voraciousness of capitalism that compelled them to endure the long and harsh experience of colonialism  that crushed them with racism and discrimination  that subjected them to the backwardness and poverty still besetting them. Capitalism was and is the essential cause of the evils afflicting our peoples; it can never be their solution. The euphoric promoters of so-called neo-liberalism are overcome with joy when they see the bankruptcy of a number of socialist projects which  as is well known  lasted barely a few decades and were tested in adverse conditions and in comparatively less developed countries. Those who exult over the failure of some socialist societies should be capable of demonstrating that capitalism is solving the problems of mankind or at least that it is doing so somewhere. After all  capitalism has been the predominant system in the world for centuries and has come to full development in some of the more wealthy countries. But  after more than 200 years of capitalism in a rich  developed and powerful country such as the United States  the population as a whole still lacks a health system; millions are calling for employment  housing  education and protection in their old age or are suffering the consequences of drug addiction  violence and other social evils; and tens of millions are victims of the worst expressions of racism and racial discrimination. The most powerful country has not been able in two centuries to solve any of those problems through capitalism  although it not only has been able to rely on its own wealth but also has been pitilessly exploiting other peoples during that lengthy period. Certain turncoats may kneel before that deceptive golden calf  but to understand the failure of capitalism as a social project it is not necessary to read Karl Marx one need only take stroll through the New York or Los Angeles inner city. The American dream may dazzle some weak minds  but for broad  and growing  sectors in this country and  above all  for tens of millions of Afro-Americans  Latinos  native Americans and Asians  the unemployed  the poor and the destitute - that dream has been  and is  a bitter  sad and perpetual nightmare. On what moral grounds can profoundly unjust societies present themselves as a universal archetype when the inordinate consumption patterns and the extravagance of their insolent minorities mock the plight of countless others in their midst who are suffering a life as miserable as that of the poorest in the third world? In terms of human solidarity they have nothing to teach us; on the contrary  they have much to learn from us. In truth  not only is the type of society that would be imposed upon us intrinsically unjust and inhuman: it threatens the survival of the human species - indeed  life itself on our planet. The irrational consumption patterns of the wealthy exhaust non-renewable resources  poison oceans and rivers  make the air in our cities unbreathable  adversely change the climate  dangerously raise the sea level  irreparably damage the soil  destroy forests  enlarge deserts and deepen the poverty of hundreds of millions of human beings. The environment is also the victim of a relentless war that has already caused the death of numerous species and is putting many others in danger of extinction. When will it be man's turn to fall victim to his own folly? For how long will a lifestyle that condemns each and every one of us to death continue to be worshipped? I address this Assembly at what is  for Cuba  a particularly difficult time. The economic  commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States against the Cuban people has been in force for more than 30 years  but it is now being intensified and extended. While talking hypocritically of peace and international cooperation  the Government in Washington forbids foreign vessels involved in any business with Cuba to enter United States ports and tries to compel corporations based in other countries to follow its anti-Cuban policy. Thus it is grossly violating not only the most basic rights of my people but also the sovereignty of other countries and the fundamental principles and norms of international law. While former adversaries become partners  and while the number of countries to which Washington applies economic restrictions diminishes  the budget and resources of the Government office entrusted with enforcement of those restrictions have been increased  and it is publicly acknowledged that those actions are geared towards reinforcement of the blockade against Cuba. The United States obstructs Cuban economic and commercial activities world wide. It strives to prevent us from purchasing oil  foodstuffs and medicines; puts pressure on investors and businessmen; and  more than once  has been able to intimidate others  and thus frustrate entirely legitimate operations  by its stubborn and criminal attempts to starve our people into surrender. Never before  other than in the course of war  has a people been subjected to such rigorous  prolonged and total attack. This aggression is being carried out against a small and poor country - a country with very few natural resources  and no substantial sources of energy; a country whose development prospects are totally dependent on foreign trade; a country that receives no credit or finance from international organizations; a country to which even various types of humanitarian aid are restricted. And now attempts are being made even to prevent us from trading. The blockade is being intensified at a time when Cuba is suffering an extremely trying situation arising from the dissolution of the Socialist bloc  the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the sudden and radical change in relations with the countries with which we conducted 80 per cent of our trade  as well as from the abrupt disappearance of the fair and equitable prices that governed those relations. This has meant the loss of 70 per cent of Cuba's purchasing power the figure having fallen from $8 139 million in 1989 to $2.2 million this year. In truth  Cuba is confronted by a double blockade that is becoming harsher and more implacable every day. Indeed  the enormous damage to our economy has had inevitable repercussions for the living standards and consumption levels of the population  as well as for the country's production and development programmes. In these grave circumstances the imperialists nurture the hope that  by making their blockade tougher and more oppressive  they will be able to create conditions of poverty and hunger and  thus  make our people surrender. However  that is nothing but a foolish hope. Those who seek to annihilate us are ignoring the fact that Cuba's main resource - its only true wealth is its people. Only a united  informed and resolute people  a people prepared to fight for what it wants to achieve  a people whose social relations are governed by equity and solidarity  can confront and overcome such adversity. Only in a society such as that of Cuba could such disastrous conditions have occurred without leading to the closure of a single school  to neglect of the health of a single child or elderly man or woman  or to the abandonment of a single citizen. Can the same be said of our rabid enemies or our hypocritical critics? There is no greater proof of the strength of our social system or of the implacable resolve and unity of the Cuban people in defence of its revolution than the heroic popular resistance to this imperialist onslaught. How many countries have endured such a trial? But this large-scale economic warfare is not the only action being taken against Cuba. Part of our territory continues to be illegally occupied by a United States military base  which is the source of frequent provocation; the air above and the sea around the country are constantly being used for manoeuvres by the mighty who assault us; more than 1 500 hours of aggressive radio broadcasts are transmitted to Cuba weekly  and there have been unsuccessful attempts to invade our television spectrum; the territory of the United States is used openly and shamelessly  and with the apparent complicity of the authorities of that country  for the purpose of carrying out terrorist attacks against us; and Cuba is being subjected to a systematic campaign of slander to distort the image of a country which the United States has not been able to defeat and which refuses to renounce its independence. As it has not been able to bend us to its will  imperialism threatens us with extermination and endeavours to compel the rest of the world to acquiesce to its genocidal infamy. The Yankee blockade is a brutal violation of the rights of all the Cuban people and of international norms and the sovereignty of other countries. It is  above all  a moral disgrace. Those who think they can bring Cuba to its knees are mistaken. Our people has travelled a long road to achieve its full emancipation. It started its trek  totally alone  more than 120 years ago. Within its limited island space  without allies  without the material support of any Government  it struggled for three decades against a better and larger military force than the total of the forces which Spain had used to combat rebellion in all its other colonies. Attempts were made even then to isolate our people from the rest of the world; even then the oppressor found accomplices; even then attempts were made to compel our people to surrender because of hunger  and a substantial part of our population was annihilated. The Puerto Rican patriot  Eugenio Maria de Hostos  described those painful times for Cuba in the following words: ""It is necessary to imagine oneself in that terrifying situation  the most tragic ever faced by any people: deprived of everything itself  while its enemy possesses all the power and resources of civilization; abandoned  while its enemy is abetted; disdained  while its enemy is flattered by the complicity of all. It is necessary to be able to feel all the torments of the agony of many years to understand how long a revolution lasts  to realize how much time passes  to understand the prodigious resistance of the combatants  to appreciate their heroism  to be worthy of admiring those admirable men ... ""It is necessary to live in such infamous times  stumbling through the darkness of injustice  to feel for those men  elevated by their own efforts to the dignity of complete men  all the enthusiastic reverence  all the impulsive admiration  inspired by those capable of heroically representing the highest virtues of mankind."" Those times referred to by Hostos were certainly even more difficult for our people. Today we are facing an enemy more powerful than Spain was then  but we have a united  brave people  worthy heirs of those combatants who never retreated despite the greatest misfortunes. We will never betray their memory; we will never renounce a fatherland which we liberated with rivers of blood and sacrifice. We also rely on the solidarity of peoples. We know that the oppressed  the exploited and the victims of discrimination on this Earth who place their hopes in Cuba's survival are many. For our dead  and for those who hope for a worthy life  we will continue resisting. We will not betray the mandate of our ancestors and the confidence of peoples. We will prove ourselves capable of resisting and we will know how to resist. We will continue to pursue our most sacred duty: to save the fatherland  the revolution and socialism. For their sake  we shall continue our struggle  without hesitating  despite all obstacles  hard and difficult though circumstances may be; ever onward to victory. "
"41",1767,"CYP",47,1992,"The memory of the cold war is fading rapidly in people's minds. Yet  the efforts for adaptation to a world not structured by the East-West divide have not yet been undertaken. As the images of violence  famine and destruction flicker on our television sets the urge that something must be done quickly seizes the consciousness and imagination of people everywhere. The world community turns to the United Nations the only universal forum at its disposal full of expectations that it will succeed in putting an end to the violence  the senseless destruction of human life and economic resources which  at this very moment  are plunging millions of people in every part of the world into despair. The end of the cold war confrontation opened the way for increased cooperation. The triumph of democracy and the cooperation of the major Powers created possibilities for the resolution of conflicts which had originated in  or were maintained by  the earlier East-West confrontation. The universal aspiration for a world of peace  liberated from the bondage of insecurity  was thus quite rightly roused. During this post-cold-war period we have witnessed positive developments in many regional problems  particularly Cambodia  Southern Africa  Central America and elsewhere. At the same time  an effort has been undertaken to find lasting peace in the Middle East through the convening of a peace conference. We welcome this positive and important development in the hope that it will lead to a comprehensive solution  safeguarding the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people while  at the same time  ensuring the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). For it is our position that all United Nations resolutions must be implemented  whichever country they concern  be it Iraq  Cyprus or former Yugoslavia. Furthermore we welcome the developments in South Africa that should lead to the end of the abhorrent regime of apartheid  in the hope that never again will any human beings on the face of this Earth be forced to live in conditions of racial  ethnic  religious or other separation from their fellow human beings. The fact that today we welcome 20 new Members in this universal Organization is sufficient evidence of the tremendous forces at work following the end of the East-West divide. Welcoming each and every one of these countries  and all of them as a whole  I express our desire to work and cooperate with them to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  in the interest of peace  security and the well-being of all. The conditions are favourable for the United Nations  as the process for a much stronger and effective Organization matures and gains momentum. However  the challenges that the Organization and its Members are called upon to meet are also crucial  for  as the old order crumbled  unparalleled forces of destruction were also unleashed. The aspirations of humanity for a better world meet with disappointment in every part of the world. The proliferation of conflicts  due to a variety of reasons  is the other face of Janus. Along with the conflicts come the long lines of refugees  the dead  the starving children  looking desperately to each one of us. Eighteen years after Cyprus suffered the devastating effects of ""ethnic cleansing"" following the Turkish invasion of 1974  we are again witnessing the restaging of similar tragedies in other parts of the world. In 1974  Turkey  a strong neighbour of small Cyprus  invaded and occupied 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic. One third of the Greek Cypriots were evicted from their ancestral homes and properties in order to create ""ethnically clean areas"". Being weak and defenseless  we turned to the United Nations. It is to the United Nations that a great part of humanity is at this very moment also turning for help. The demands are greater now and they are tending to increase. The fact that the world Organization is free of the fetters imposed by the adversarial relations of the super-Powers in the cold war era enhances its possibilities. The burden  however  will be unbearable if the process towards a more effective United Nations  with the necessary resources and increased capabilities not only in the field of peace-keeping  but particularly in the fields of peace-making and conflict prevention  as analysed in the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace - is not quickly realized. Cyprus can again be brought up as a case-study and example. Following the invasion in 1974  the United Nations system was mobilised' The Security Council and the General Assembly adopted resolutions demanding respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus and an immediate end to foreign military intervention and called urgently for a cease-fire. The United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) supervised the cease-fire and assured the peace-keeping operation. It has fulfilled this role as well as other humanitarian functions admirably. And we are grateful to all the men who served in UNFICYP for their contribution. But 18 years later  the Cyprus problem is still not solved and as a consequence UNFICYP is confronted with serious financial problems. If even a small number of the peace-keeping operations the United Nations is now undertaking have the duration of UNFICYP  given their scale and scope  very soon the Organization will not be able to cope with the financial and other burdens. The Cyprus example is  I believe  sufficient evidence that an intense peace-making effort must be pursued in parallel with every peace-keeping operation. For the cost can be limited not by simply eliminating the role  but by opening the way for just and viable solutions. In the case of Cyprus  despite the lack of results because of the negative attitude of the Turkish side during the long negotiations aimed at finding a solution  the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  correctly seized the moment and pursued an intense  renewed effort to this end. The Security Council  already actively involved in the process  put its weight behind those efforts and engaged itself in an unprecedented way. We took our share of responsibility and engaged in those talks in the spirit of good will and conciliation. For we want to put an end to the forcible division of our country and the resulting suffering of so many  particularly of the families of the missing persons. In brief  we want to see an end to the status quo  characterized by the Security Council as not acceptable. Unfortunately  the Turkish side remained intransigent on its aims of perpetuating the division of Cyprus into two ""ethnically clean"" regions  in utter violation of human rights and basic rules of international law. Even today we hear voices from Turkey speaking against federation  claiming that since two different communities live on Cyprus the island should be partitioned. Just imagine how the world would look if this principle were applied universally. As the Secretary-General underlined in an interview a few days ago  the new danger that will appear in the world in the next 10 years is more fragmentation. Rather than 100 or 200 countries  said the Secretary-General  there may be at the end of the century 400 countries. By way of example he went on to say that in Africa there are 5 000 tribes  and if each tribe claimed the right to self-determination we would end up with many small States of 50 000 to 100 000 people each. We can all imagine the effects that this would have on the hopes of humanity for sustainable development. That is why what happens in Cyprus and the solution of the Cyprus problem based on United Nations resolutions must be of concern to the international community. The report of the Secretary-General on Cyprus (S/24472) clearly shows why no progress was made in the July and August talks. Furthermore  the ""Set of ideas"" and the map which are annexed to the report have been endorsed by the Security Council in resolution 774 (1992) as the basis for reaching a solution. We should like  in this context  to express our appreciation and thanks to the Secretary-General and the Security Council for all their support and involvement in our case. The resolution also calls for resumption of the talks on 26 October. As always  we intend to cooperate fully with the Secretary-General and negotiate with good will. We sincerely hope that the Turkish side  despite its so-far negative public statements  will at long last cooperate. If  despite the efforts of the Secretary-General  our good will and the involvement of the Security Council  the talks in October become a repetition of the unpleasant exercise we experienced this summer  we are confident that the Security Council and the Assembly will assure the conditions for progress. For it would be tragic further to delay  or even frustrate  the effort for a solution in Cyprus. The people of Cyprus  Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots alike  want to put the past behind them and advance towards a better future. The reunification of Cyprus will open a new era of prosperity and progress to the benefit of all Cypriots in particular  of Turkish Cypriots and our region. I am certain that the solution of the Cyprus problem is the only way  and a necessary condition  for the economic and social development of all Cypriots. In this competitive world of ours  only if Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots are united and join forces will they be able to win the place they deserve in the world. The Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace"" introduces peace-building and preventive diplomacy as concepts of the utmost importance. The conceptual framework of the ""Agenda"" is indeed remarkable in its ramifications and the linkages it establishes between peace and security  international law  democracy  human rights and sustainable development. Cyprus  which accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice  welcomes and supports the Secretary-General's proposals in the field of international law  as set out in the report. Our long-term efforts should be aimed at creating such conditions as will make the possibility of war unthinkable  even between nations that have a history of enmity. In order to achieve such a result on a global basis the United Nations must adapt itself swiftly to the changing conditions. A better balance and coordination between the various bodies that form the Organization and the specialized agencies are needed. A more effective and more democratic United Nations is an essential component of a stable and democratic world order. Furthermore  as the Secretary-General pointedly underlines in his report to the General Assembly  we must render our Organization ""capable of dealing comprehensively with the economic  social  environmental and political dimensions of human development."" (A/47/1. para. 9) The General Assembly  representing all the Members of the United Nations  has a major role to play in the realization of this major objective. And I am certain that under the able leadership of our President  my good friend the Foreign Minister of Bulgaria  Mr. Ganev  it will rise to these challenges. I also take this opportunity to pay tribute  Mr. President  to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for the skilful manner in which he steered the work of the forty-sixth session. Prominent among the challenges we have to meet is the protection of human rights in all their dimensions  civil and political as well as social  economic and cultural. The progress achieved in this field during recent years  encouraging though it is  should not mislead us. Much progress still needs to be achieved. That is why we look forward to the World Conference on Human Rights  which will present us with a great opportunity not only to assess the progress achieved so far  but also  and mainly  to define the means for rendering our collective action for the protection of human rights more effective. The issue of human rights is crucial  for it relates not only to peace-making and peace-building  but also to preventive diplomacy. The first victims of galloping nationalism and micronationalism everywhere  as we can clearly see  are the human rights of citizens. We in Cyprus  unfortunately  have bitter experience of this fact. Tolerance and respect for the beliefs and particularities of others within societies and peaceful relations among nations are the conditions for the prevalence of the rule of law and thus of human rights. And as peace is no longer the end product of mutual fear  it will be maintained only through the prevalence of mutual understanding  communication and confidence. In this respect  the process of disarmament has a key function to play. In spite of the progress we all welcome  and in particular the agreement reached within the Conference on Disarmament on a draft convention for the elimination of chemical weapons  disarmament is still of the utmost priority in our quest for general stability. The positive developments in the field of nuclear weapons constitute an asset that has to be safeguarded. However  the risk of intense arms races between regional Powers is more than a threat: it is a reality. It is only through eliminating the roots of insecurity  which makes the acquisition of arms a vital need for States  and through creating the institutional framework that will enhance the feeling of security and thereby diminish to the maximum the need for self-help in case of aggression  that real progress can be achieved. We know how painful it is to spend precious resources on arms and we hurt when we have to pay a few million dollars just to buy a new tank. But what other choice are we left with when on a small island like Cyprus the Turkish army outnumbers us in this field by a ratio of 7 to 1  constantly threatening our physical existence? Time and again we have proposed the demilitarization of Cyprus  together with the withdrawal of the Turkish forces from Cyprus. We are committed to using the resources thus saved for development purposes - most of them directed to projects that will have an immediate effect on the standard of living of the Turkish Cypriots. Thus  the peace-building process will be further strengthened and the people of Cyprus as a whole will benefit. Human rights and democracy will amount to little if social misery  starvation and underdevelopment are the lot of the great majority of the population of this planet. The fragile flower of democracy cannot bloom on the arid soil of poverty. What sense can the right to vote have if one is condemned to remain hungry  roofless and without the very basic necessities? As the Jakarta Declaration  adopted during the tenth non-aligned summit only some weeks ago  clearly states: ""A shift of forces in international relations towards strengthening multilateral cooperation for development has become indispensable."" The division between rich and poor  developed and developing  should not be allowed to become a new source of instability and tension that would undermine the foundations of international society. It is an illusion to think that any country  however rich or great  can survive isolated  surrounded by an archipelago of poverty. If we want peace and social stability we must address the issues of growth and sustainable development in their human and social dimensions. Indebtedness  mainly due to the collapse of commodity prices and the subsequent transfer of resources from poor to rich countries  continues to hurt the developing world. Barriers to trade raise formidable obstacles to the efforts of developing countries to reach the markets of the highly industrialized North and limit their possibilities for growth while having an adverse effect on the export prices of their products. That is why we are anxious about the delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations and express the hope that the target for completing the negotiations - that is  the end of 1992 will be achieved this time. Developing nations' access to technology is still very restricted and this adds to the already existing inequalities that hamper growth on a global level. Technology is not an end in itself. The transfer of technologies from developed to developing countries is a pre-condition for sustainable development on a global scale. The problem is also directly linked to that of the flow of financial resources for productive investment in developing countries. What is at stake here is not only the solidarity that developed countries should demonstrate. It is also a rational response that will guarantee their own ability to continue to progress in a world which progresses as a whole. It is now widely acknowledged that in our quest for development in the past we regarded environment solely as a commodity ripe for exploitation. Now we have come to realize that it is man who belongs to the environment and not the environment to man. It is therefore necessary to define a new synthesis between environment and development. The Rio Conference was a major step in that direction. The world summit gave the correct message; it shaped the international will and marked a new beginning. Concrete and effective measures must follow. The Rio Declaration must not remain a dead letter. We have to translate into action its provisions  which should guide us in every policy decision. The 1990s is a decade of dramatic changes. The contradictory forces and undercurrents that shape the outcome of events must be shaped and guided towards the creation of a peaceful and democratic world order. The United Nations is the soul itself  the consciousness of humanity as a collective entity. As such  it demonstrates a flexibility and a capacity for adaptation which are admirable. People of worth  dedicated men and women  work in every part of the world fulfilling impossible missions. We thank them all. We have reached a moment when  as Member States  we must assume further responsibilities and  faithful to the principles of the Charter of this Organization  work in unison in helping the United Nations to achieve its objectives. Humanity has conquered mighty and formidable peaks. We cannot turn back. We are committed to shaping and channelling the hopes and aspirations of mankind for a more free  democratic and tolerant world  with a better quality of life for all. "
"42",1853,"DEU",47,1992,"In electing you to your high office last week  Mr. President  the General Assembly also identified itself with the victory of freedom and democracy throughout Europe. I should like to congratulate you on this and greet you as the representative of a country with which we have a close and long-standing friendship. For you  Mr. Secretary-General  this is the first session of the General Assembly since you took office. For the determination and energy with which you have set about the huge tasks ahead you deserve the appreciation of us all. I extend a special welcome to the representatives of those countries that have been admitted to our Organization since the last session of the General Assembly. The world breathed a sigh of relief when the East-West confrontation ended at long last. There was an almost tangible euphoria of peace. Since then we have come back down to earth. Freedom has opened the door not only to historic opportunities but  unfortunately  to the old demons as well: blind nationalism and hegemonic aspirations  xenophobia and religious fanaticism. In this process  the dramatic changes to the political map are far from having settled down. The impact of the quake cannot yet be fully assessed  nor can we rule out further tremors. But despite all our new problems we must not forget that hardly any previous generation had such opportunities to live in peace  harmony and prosperity with its neighbours. We can therefore look to the future with confidence. And this opportunity extends beyond Europe. The termination of the East-West conflict has paved the way for the settlement of conflicts in the southern hemisphere as well  conflicts which for decades seemed insoluble. In the Middle East  in southern Africa and in Cambodia the parties involved are moving towards each other in a manner that would have been inconceivable in the days of the ideological proxy wars. Thus my message is: let us continue to be guided by the vision of a better  a more equitable world. With great perseverance  we have ended the East-West confrontation. We now need the same commitment  the same stamina  to build a new order. We must keep in mind the new energies that have been released and harness them for peace and for mankind. By establishing European union  the European Community is trying to seize. the chance of the century for the entire continent. It is the vision of a truly united Europe. The affirmation of this union by our French friends has kept alive the chance to make that vision a reality.  However  Governments must also take their citizens along with them on this road to Europe. Europe does not grow out of treaties; it grows from the hearts of its citizens or it does not grow at all. Strengthening their confidence in Europe's common future remains the principal task of Community policy in the months ahead. Although the dissatisfaction  uncertainty and lack of understanding that have become apparent in nearly all countries cannot simply be dismissed  no changes to the Treaty of Maastricht are needed to cushion some of the effects. The European Community is not only a model of hope and prosperity for Eastern Europe; it has also developed new forms of cooperation and partnership with the developing countries. Its path towards integration has inspired many regional initiatives in Asia  Africa and Latin America. In the light of this global responsibility  too  Europe must come to speak with one voice here at the United Nations as well. In these times of change  when so much of what was valid yesterday is being challenged  when many people in the West see their standard of living  their personal security and their national and cultural identity threatened  when even more people in the East and in the South do not know today what they are going to live on tomorrow  when an army of refugees from war and poverty threatens to become a new migration  we shall have to find an answer to the question of whether the international community  through its new spirit of common endeavour following the cold war  will be capable of mastering the challenges of our time. There is doubt as to the ability of the political establishment as a whole to find solutions  and this applies not only to Europe. There is a huge gap between people's expectations and the actual achievements of Governments   both internally and externally. Governments are under an obligation to achieve again greater consistency between verbal commitment and action. The historic process of European unification is currently being overshadowed by something that was considered inconceivable only a few years ago: the return of barbarity to the European house. A war of destruction and expulsion is raging in Bosnia and Herzegovina  a conflict which conjures up a terrible past. What is happening there and we cannot be clear enough about this is genocide. The London Conference has underscored the resolve of the community of nations to silence the weapons. It has initiated the Geneva negotiating process as a common  major effort of the United Nations and the European Community probably one of the last chances to secure a political solution in the foreseeable future. The co-Chairmen of the conference  Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen  have our full support. Germany will play its part in this peace conference. But one thing must remain clear: the community of nations will never recognize borders that have been changed by force. Those who hope to receive assistance from the family of nations later must stop fighting now at once. Despite cautious signs that the Serbian leaders are perhaps after all becoming aware of the consequences of being outlawed by the international community  murder and expulsion continue. We have been shocked by the report of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) mission on the crimes and atrocities perpetrated in the detention camps. We Europeans especially must be honest: each day on which innocent civilians are fired at and prisoners tortured undermines the credibility and authority of the new Europe we aim to build together.  War also prevails in Somalia  the Sudan  Liberia  Afghanistan  Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Greed  anarchy and human suffering have assumed heart-wrenching dimensions  especially in Somalia. The community of nations  though late in doing so  has turned its attention to the starvation  misery and want of the people there. It is to be hoped that the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative Mr. Sahnoun will be able to restore peace to this sorely tried country and put it back on a sound economic foundation. What are the conclusions for the international community that must be drawn from this situation? Respect for international law and human rights as the foundation of peace and international order was one of the main lessons of the Second World War. That experience led to the creation of the United Nations and the European Community. The aim of overcoming nationalistic hegemony  the use of force and violations of human rights by means of international and supranational cooperation is still valid. Even setbacks must not be allowed to divert us from this just path of law and respect for human dignity. There is no reasonable alternative  unless we want to revert to the law of the jungle. Only if the United Nations or the regional organizations prove capable of protecting individual States from external aggression and minorities from domestic persecution will it be possible  now that the East-West conflict is over  to make the desired transition from policies of national hegemony and armament to the rule of law  collective security and economic and social development. What will this require? Firstly  the system of collective security of the United Nations  and of regional arrangements such as the CSCE  must be made a powerful instrument of a new world domestic policy. Conflicts are  unfortunately  emerging faster than the instruments to contain them. You  Mr. Secretary-General  have made extensive proposals with the correct aim of making the United Nations  for the first time in its history  what the Charter intended it to be: the world community's chief custodian of peace; and that aim  I say here  can be achieved. ""Nip it in the bud!"" This must be the golden rule of conflict prevention. Diplomatic activity must start before an acute threat to security occurs. Such activity must  where necessary  be reinforced by the preventive deployment of peace-keeping forces. This proposal has our full support. It must be made absolutely clear to a potential aggressor  right from the start  that he must expect to be confronted with the whole range of political  economic and military sanctions provided for in the United Nations Charter. Anyone who holds a protecting hand over the aggressor must expect to be isolated  and anyone who breaks sanctions will likewise have sanctions to contend with. Crucial for collective security is close cooperation between institutions such as the United Nations or the CSCE on the one hand and collective defence alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the Western European Union on the other. Initial steps have been taken in this direction in recognition of the fact that  even though the East-West conflict has ended  democracies must  firstly  remain capable of defending themselves and the new architecture must  secondly  become capable of defending itself. What is beyond dispute domestically must also be applied to international security if there is to be real order. If all other means fail  the law must  if necessary  be protected by military force against those who violate it. This is also a lesson from a past that was  for us Germans in particular  a disastrous one. This is anchored in the United Nations Charter. Germany's contribution to international stability will continue to focus on peacemaking  through economic cooperation  protection of human rights  humanitarian aid  and international measures to protect the environment. However  we must also establish the constitutional basis to enable us to make our armed forces available to the United Nations  with the approval of Parliament  for peace-keeping and peacemaking assignments. As a reunited and sovereign country we must assume all the rights and obligations of a Member of the United Nations to avoid any discrepancy between our verbal commitment to peace and human rights and our active involvement in their defence. The Government and the Parliament of my country will not forget that our history commands us to show particular restraint and judgment; but  while remaining aware of the past  we must derive the strength and courage to find a better future. Within the framework of its constitution Germany has already participated in United Nations operations for example  in Namibia  Angola  Central America  Cambodia and Iraq by providing logistic and organizational support  election observers  verification teams and medical personnel. Our relief flights to Sarajevo and Somalia have broadened the range of our commitment. The reforms you have vigorously initiated  Mr. Secretary General  have our full backing. We encourage you to pursue them with determination. The appointment of a coordinator for humanitarian assistance has shown  despite all the scepticism  that this Organization is capable of change. Further reforms should  in our view  focus principally on three areas: rationalization of the Secretariat  streamlining its committees and procedures  and strengthening the position of the Secretary-General in relation to the subsidiary bodies and specialized agencies. This is urgently needed  especially in the central area of environment and development. The Security Council is the guardian of international peace. Its efficiency and credibility are of equal importance. A debate on reforming the Council is under way. We Germans will not take the initiative in this respect  but if a change in the Council's composition is actually considered we too shall make known our intention to seek a permanent seat. Secondly  States and regional organizations must assume greater responsibility. The United Nations must not be overstrained: the idea that it can protect and feed all people afflicted by external or internal war is a Utopian. Thirdly  we must further develop the international legal system with the aim of further protecting mankind and nature. This can now take place in a process of fair partnership  free from bloc ideology. This too represents a great opportunity in the wake of the East-West conflict. In this process  we must bring out the special dimension of law: it demands participation and consensus. All are equal before the law. It protects the weak and legitimizes the use of force where force is unavoidable. No cultural region should try to force its own system of values on others. On the other hand  there is a body of human rights universally binding under international law which no one should seek to erode  not even on grounds of differing cultural traditions. This must be the central message of the Conference on Human Rights to be held in Vienna next year. Under the Nazi regime  the gravest crimes against humanity were committed in the name of Germany. In 1945  the Germans in the western part of our country had the good fortune to be able to establish a free  democratic society based on the rule of law. Those in the other part of Germany had to bear another totalitarian regime until 1990. So we Germans have well and truly suffered in this respect. We know from our own experience that a life of dignity and fulfilment is not possible without respect for human rights. I therefore never tire of repeating my belief that policy  including foreign policy  must focus on the individual. It is he who counts. It is he who must be protected and saved from injustice. The defence of human rights remains a central aim of German foreign policy. An effective international legal system must enable people to exercise their human rights  afford protection to those whose human rights have been violated  and consistently bring the perpetrators to account. Together with our partners in the European Community we call for the appointment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights. Those who commit genocide  those who commit serious violations of human rights - and this  unfortunately  is happening all the time all over the world - ask Amnesty International must be brought before an international crimes tribunal. I am gratified to note that Germany's proposal for such a tribunal is now receiving broad support. The International Law Commission should be given a mandate to draw up an appropriate statute. We shall strive to ensure that the perpetrators of atrocities  no matter who they are  are brought to justice. No one should be able to rest in the assurance that the matter will be forgotten. This is another reason why we need a High Commissioner for Human Rights. His investigations and other information should be collated in a register to serve as the basis for subsequent criminal proceedings. Our experience with the regime in the former German Democratic Republic shows that the fear of such misdeeds being recorded is not without effect. Violation of human rights is one of mankind's great scourges. We should not spare ourselves the effort needed to expose  denounce and prevent them. Although the massive East-West confrontation is a thing of the past  disarmament  confidence-building and the control of arms exports remain essential preconditions for enhancing peace. After an arms race spanning decades the new era has made considerable progress in the field of disarmament as well. Yet the world is still bristling with weapons. We in Europe are the first to have begun destroying tanks. The pacification of the North must not lead to the South being armed to the hilt. The developing countries do not need more tanks and guns but more schools and hospitals. The United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must be seen as the point of departure for reducing the present irresponsible level of international trade in weapons. Preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction is the most urgent task in the field of disarmament today. Germany is determined to play a pioneering role in this respect. We are the only country in the world to have unilaterally and unconditionally renounced nuclear  biological and chemical weapons. The Convention imposing a global ban on chemical weapons  which was prepared by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament under our chairmanship  is a milestone along this road. I call upon all Members of the United Nations to signal their support of this Convention during the present session of the General Assembly and to sign it without delay. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must be extended indefinitely in 1995. If we fail to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons  mankind will become exposed to a nuclear threat no less frightening than that of the cold war. We cannot put the nuclear genie back in the bottle  but we must keep it under strict control. This also calls for an international convention for the enhancement of reactor safety. All these are tasks enough  but the biggest of all is that of establishing a new partnership for development and environmental protection between poor and rich nations which will make the Earth a fit place for the present and future generations to live in. The world is grossly unjust. From the day of their birth countless people do not have the slightest chance whatsoever of living in conditions that could even remotely be described as worthy of the human race. About a billion people live in abject poverty and can neither read nor write. Almost 20 million refugees are trying to escape from want. One fifth of the world's population consumes four fifths of all resources and earns 60 times as much as the poorest fifth. We in the industrialized countries  on the other hand  concerned with our own problems which I do not deny exist - forget that  compared with many regions of the third world  we live on an ""island of bliss"". Many of us think only of our entitlements  about defending our standards of living. As a result  we tend to forget the values of humanity and solidarity. Our free system in the West may have won the struggle with totalitarianism  but we must now prove that our economic system  our way of life  is able to secure lasting development in the eastern and southern regions of the globe as well. In the third world countries  on the other hand  the recognition must continue to grow that they cannot simply make demands on others but are themselves primarily responsible for keeping their house in order. The Jakarta Conference has confirmed the clear change of attitude in this respect. This is an encouraging trend. What is the essential requirement? It is to develop a global partnership and forms of coexistence in the North and the South which will ensure mutual survival. For this we shall have to find a reasonable middle way between the completely unrealistic attitude that everything must be achieved at one fell swoop and that of resignation  the attitude that it is already too late. The North must open its markets to give the weaker economies a genuine chance of development. By eliminating protectionism we must strengthen the economic foundations of those countries currently fighting for democracy and human rights. That is why it is so important to bring the negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to a successful conclusion. Stabilizing the economy of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States must not be done at the expense of development aid. Bringing the new democracies in the East and the developing countries into a global partnership together was the general objective of the economic summit meeting in Munich. Germany  too  has kept its word in this respect. In spite of our exceptional domestic situation and our enormous contribution to the process of economic recovery in the new democracies between Bug and Vladivostok  our development aid budget has continued to grow - even since 1990. And we shall continue to provide substantial support for measures to bridge the poverty gap between North and South. Our offer to make Bonn the location for some United Nations development activities should be understood in this sense. What is required is a radical technological transformation in the fields of transport  energy  industrial production  housing and agriculture and a new generation of environment-friendly technologies. To implement the results of the Rio Conference there will have to be standard reduction levels for carbon dioxide emissions as well as effective measures for the protection of forests. The most difficult task is at the same time one of the most important that of implementing a responsible population policy. This calls for changes which considerably affect the rights of the individual. The first step must be to improve the social status of women in the developing countries. People have a right to determine the size of their family themselves. Family planning must be given greater prominence in development strategy. The importance of the International Conference on Population and Development to be held in 1994 and of the World Conference on Women scheduled for 1995 cannot be emphasized enough. The help provided by the industrialized countries can never be more than help towards self-help. One must also draw the necessary conclusion from the collapse of communist ideology: totalitarianism renders a country incapable of development. In a nutshell  what is needed is a departure from short-sighted egoism and over-exploitation of nature towards measures to safeguard the future  towards more social justice  as well as a balance between ecology and economy. In this age of growing individual freedom we must also remain capable of demonstrating solidarity and showing consideration for the community as a whole. The responsible use of freedom is the real challenge at the end of this century. In order to meet this challenge  and for the sake of our children's future  the world - East and West  North and South must learn together. We must learn to survive together in a new world. No institution is more suited to be the central authority of this learning community than the United Nations. In 1995 it will celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. Let us by that date together strengthen this forum to make it capable of fulfilling the hopes of people all over the globe. Let us not forget: We  the nations  will get the world Organization we deserve! Hardly any country can have been more affected by the dramatic upheavals of our time and by the disparity of opportunity and risk  of hope and anxiety about the future  than has Germany. We have been reunited  and for that we are grateful very grateful. Our prime task now is to complete the internal unification of our nation  and this task pushes us to the limits of our resources. None the less  we have contributed more to the economic recovery of central and eastern Europe and the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) than have all other countries together. In Europe  our liberal legislation on foreigners has enabled us to take in by far the largest number of asylum-seekers probably 400 000 this year; 220 000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have found refuge in our country. We are the biggest attraction in Europe and in the world for the massive social migration from East to West and from South to North. In view of our still-high level of unemployment and our housing shortage  especially in the eastern part of the country  this places an exceptional burden on the population. This has to be appreciated if one is to make a fair judgement of our people's attitude towards foreigners. In emphasizing this point I am not trying to tone it down. The hatred demonstrated and the terror perpetrated by a radical minority against asylum-seekers in our country brings disgrace on Germany. This I deeply regret  but let me add that this is not the attitude of the great majority of Germans towards other nationalities. In my country 6.3 million foreigners live harmoniously with their German neighbours. Year in  year out  the Germans demonstrate their solidarity with other nations through extensive relief campaigns  through their generous donations for the benefit of people in the former Soviet Union  and through their considerable aid for the Kurds and the starving people of Somalia. Germany owes its unity to the dismantling of confrontation in Europe and to the trust we have gained through our European policy and through our not having pursued a national course. We derive from this a responsibility. We shall continue to give our full support to European unification and global cooperation based on partnership  especially within the United Nations. We shall use all our energy in favour of human rights and against oppression  in favour of global solidarity and against excessive nationalism. This is the essence of the foreign policy of the united Germany for which I stand. "
"43",1891,"DJI",47,1992,"First of all  let me convey to all members of the General Assembly the greetings of the people of Djibouti. I should like to take this opportunity to address to you  Mr. President  my warmest congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am convinced that you will guide our deliberations in such a way as to bring them to a successful conclusion  and I wish you every success. That was the case at last year's session  at which Mr. Samir Shihabi  Ambassador of a great fraternal country  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  presided over the General Assembly. We are indebted to him for the important achievements in the field of restructuring and revitalizing the United Nations. I should like to express to the former Permanent Representative  who is leaving us  our best wishes for the future. I should also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the son of Africa and the Arab world  my brother and friend Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the dignified and enlighten way in which  for almost a year  he has been discharging his duties in the Secretariat. I wish to emphasize that my country fully appreciates the efforts Mr. Boutros-Ghali is making to find lasting solutions to the various crises and wars throughout the world  thus promoting peace and international cooperation. Moreover  in his annual report on the activities of the Organization  the Secretary-General has highlighted the many vital issues before the United Nations ranging from the Organization's financial crisis to its added responsibilities as a result of the changes under way  which are sorely testing the resources available to the Organization. In this respect  the establishment by the Secretary-General of an advisory group of eminent persons to study and formulate proposals to make the United Nations financially solvent seems to us to be an appropriate and timely initiative. Lastly  it is with great pleasure that I welcome the States which have joined the United Nations this year. The end of the cold war has brought important issues into sharp focus  namely  sovereignty  peace-keeping and democracy. National boundaries are fast collapsing and internal civil strife is growing with increasing intensity. The changing context of the international political landscape and the concomitant flareup of conflicts in many regions of the world are sufficient reason to reflect upon new ways and means to contain the evolving threats to international peace and security. In that regard  the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace contains ideas and proposals such as the use of preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and peace-making; it deserves the fullest attention of the General Assembly. States new and old are ravaged by ethnic and clan rivalries. The United Nations therefore needs the unwavering support of the international community in order to be able to respond urgently  effectively and substantially to these new phenomena of our time. Will the nascent democracies  in their weak and poorly equipped condition  be able to cope with urgent demands for material improvement? And if they cannot deliver  could they not lose popular support? Democracy under relatively favourable conditions is obviously far different both in theory and in practice indeed  in every respect from democracy in a country in a vicious circle of dependence  poverty and instability. The proliferation of political parties in a pluralistic system invariably leads to parties based on ethnicity. Clearly  there must be an alternative framework for these democracies suffering from dire economic conditions and from chronic problems of debt  disease  hunger and poverty. The Speaker of Namibia's National Assembly described the situation forthrightly: ""We have learned that once you have acquired a constitution and achieved the goal of political independence and freedom  you will find that you cannot eat votes in a ballot box"". In Africa and many countries elsewhere in the developing world  we see pressure being exerted to reduce and disperse national sovereignty. This is a dangerous precedent in the new regional and international order that is emerging. In his address to the summit of non-aligned countries at Jakarta  the Secretary-General forcefully expressed his apprehension  saying that ""Recent geopolitical changes are characterized by a greater degree of homogeneity in the world  which we welcome as a precious harbinger of concord and unity. Yet neither decolonization nor the dismantling of the blocs has erased the phenomenon of power. Attempts to dominate  either world-wide or regionally  remain. They continue to threaten the weakest and poorest States  which are still the most numerous in the world"". I share the view of the Secretary-General that the new world order must be based on democracy in international relations  and that at the same time each of us  particularly the developing countries  must remain steadfast on the fundamental principles of national sovereignty  non-intervention in the internal affairs of a State  and international cooperation. In my last address to this Assembly  on 21 September 1977  on the occasion of my country's admission to the United Nations  I described in addition to the joy we felt on acceding to our freedom my determination to contribute to adherence to respect for human rights in the Horn of Africa. That ambition was no doubt too lofty  or premature  for since then too many events - often tragic have occurred; their harmful consequences show no sign of abatement. We are aware of  and grateful for  the vital and essential role played by the Secretary-General in bringing the question of Somalia squarely before the Security Council  in the signature of the cease-fire agreement concluded in New York between hostile brothers  and in the deployment of United Nations forces to deliver humanitarian assistance. Thus  to the international community  which has now made a massive response with humanitarian assistance  we convey all our gratitude and our support in this urgent task  which includes the restoration of civil peace and security in Somalia. The nightmarish sight of children breathing their last in their mothers' emaciated arms  and those equally unbearable images of women and old men who no longer have the strength even to walk or to show the least expression in their faces and whose death is already in their eyes  shocked us as they shocked the whole world. In the name of what might could a whole nation condemn itself to self-destruction? The tragedy in Somalia is not inevitable; that is to say  human stupidity sometimes causes more devastation than natural disasters. While the world has belatedly come to realize the full extent of what is happening today in that country  there is nothing to indicate that this tragedy will not claim more victims hundreds of thousands of them in the months to come. Somalia as we knew it no longer exists. In the absence of national government and central authority  the nation has been plunged into total anarchy. Indeed  it has returned to a state of veritable barbarism. The differences involved have nothing to do with ideology or politics. It is simply sheer  blind obsession with power. We clearly see the result of the tenacity of the oppressive  tyrannical warlords and clans who have reduced a whole country to rubble. Somalia  which has never in its history known such a famine or such a disaster  needs all of us to save it from this apocalypse that has descended on its people  victims of the folly and narrow-minded egotism of men. A whole country has been razed  reduced to rubble  by war  drought and famine. It is a wasteland ruled by armed gangs of bandits and looters. death  human misery and abject poverty are rampant. Providing humanitarian assistance under such conditions of warfare is extremely dangerous. In Somalia's neighbouring countries  including Djibouti< the Somali refugees are either in urban centres  straining already-limited and underdeveloped resources  or in camps that are dangerously crowded  facing shortages of food and medical supplies. Nobody can say with certainty how many people have already died  but at least 1.5 million people  one-third of the population  are threatened with starvation  children  women and old people being especially vulnerable. I can only echo the desperation of a Red Cross official in Baidoa who said  ""We are in the middle of the tunnel  and we can't see the light yet."" Our hearts go out to the personnel of the international humanitarian organizations who  despite the dangers  care for  feed and save the lives of the innocent victims of this senseless fratricide. The question before us today is not only how to save lives through the delivery of sufficient food to end the famine or how to stop the senseless fighting. Rather  in a scenario like that of Somalia  the question is what the United Nations  together with the international community  can devise collectively to reorganize a new nation of Somalia. Let us make a commitment today that we are bound together by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter not to let any country simply vanish from our midst! There is another persistent crisis which continues to shock us all  namely  the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The entire world is horrified at the war being waged in that very young republic. For several months now  the country has been facing armed aggression from outside. The efforts made to date by the international community to halt the aggression by Serbia and Montenegro by political and economic means and to settle this crisis peacefully have been in vain. It is  on the contrary  becoming more and more evident that the Serbian authorities are using this conflict to carry out a policy of ""ethnic cleansing"". If peace is to prevail in that region  all the provisions of the agreement reached at the London Conference must be implemented immediately. And if hostilities still continue  we call on the international community to implement all the provisions of the Security Council resolutions concerning recourse to all necessary measures  including military force  to come to the aid of that martyred country. Djibouti is addressing the Organization today at a time when it is in the process of overcoming a war that has been imposed upon it. It will succeed  thanks to the unfailing attachment of Djiboutians to their homeland and their will to live together in peace; thanks to the support of fraternal and friendly countries  and thanks  lastly  to the continued assistance of the United Nations in defence of our right to sovereignty  independence and peace. Since its accession to independence  on 27 June 1977  the Republic of Djibouti has had to face not only complex problems of economic and social development  but also and above all - the negative impact on its precarious socio-economic infrastructure of the constant  destabilizing wars in the region. Devastation is never confined to the geographical area of one country or one subregion; it extends across frontiers and endangers the stability of neighbouring countries  whose populations are  in most cases  of the same origin. This is precisely what is happening in Djibouti  whose population is increasing daily as a result of the continual influx of men  women and children with no alternative but to abandon their country for a more hospitable environment. For many months now Djibouti has been playing host to an alarming number of refugees and displaced persons. I therefore feel compelled to look to the future needs of our State  which cannot indefinitely share its meagre resources without risking to the adverse reactions of the community whose interests it has a duty to safeguard. While we have been struggling through this difficult ordeal the international community  rather than relieving and helping us  has unfortunately perceived the problem only from the purely humanitarian standpoint  thus disregarding the negative consequences for the entire social and economic life of my country. In response to the egalitarian ideas we have been hearing for many years  which originate from beyond our frontiers  my Government has been constantly engaged in examining all possibilities which might lead to the restoration of peace. It has also pursued a process leading to the establishment of new institutions  which were put to the judgement of the voters at the beginning of this month. The response of the people was astonishingly clear. The vote was preceded by a law instituting a general amnesty relating to events during the period characterized by the de facto partition  brought about on the initiative of a negligible portion of the population. They had considerable foreign reinforcements  who came from not very far away  and whose motives  as well as the origin of the resources they received  were not hard to ascertain. Some may consider that this is only a phase  despite the introduction of a multiparty system and the fixing of dates for the people to choose their representatives at all levels of political life. I believe that I have reason to hope that  with the understanding of friendly countries  the support of international organizations  the good will of our people and the help of the Almighty  our nation can look to a future full of possibilities and with renewed hope. The serious recent events in South Africa in particular  the Boipatong massacre on 17 June 1992 and more recently the killing of 28 demonstrators show the extent to which violence is still the order of the day. The refusal of the South African authorities to control that violence is casting a shadow over the progress made in South Africa's political life and is disrupting the process of peaceful change which the majority of the South African people so earnestly desire. There is no alternative to negotiations for peaceful change in South Africa. To this end  the international community will have to continue to put pressure on the authorities in Pretoria to take the energetic measures required to contain once and for all the forces opposed to the elimination of apartheid. To do this  they must create a climate of security conducive to the resumption of dialogue for the emergence of a united  democratic and non-racial South Africa. We welcome the deployment of United Nations observers  who I hope will help to avoid further massacres and to relaunch a constructive dialogue between the Government and the majority of the South African population. All of our attention has been focused on the initiatives and efforts under way in Washington to promote a credible peace that will lead to a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis. In welcoming those developments  Djibouti pays tribute to the Government of the United States of America and to all those contributing to the establishment of a just and lasting peace in that part of the Middle East. Nevertheless  the following are essential conditions for peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the region; the self-determination of the Palestinian people; a total freeze on settlements; the abandonment of all repressive policies and practices against the population of the occupied territories; and the withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied since June 1967  including East Jerusalem. Like all nations of the world  the Arabs want peace. They have demonstrated this desire and proved it time and again through a series of goodwill gestures and indeed through substantial major compromises in the current negotiating framework. This wisdom and this openness of mind have not to date been reciprocated by compatible language. What the Arabs are calling for is comprehensive and genuine talks that fully and seriously address the key issues of peace  land and security. Let us see if Israel will start once and for all to negotiate in good faith. Let us see if it will move in tandem with the propitious international political climate. By continually demanding more security and more concessions while the status quo over territory and peace persists  Israel is simply squandering a precious moment. It is high time that reason prevailed over age-old hatred  acrimony  injustice and obstinacy. In his annual report on the work of the Organization  the economic situation in the world in general and  in particular  the constant deterioration of the economies of most of the developing countries  the Secretary-General amply illustrates the bleak economic situation that exists in most of the world. Although the responsibility for solving economic problems at the national level rests in the first place with the countries concerned  no national effort  however forceful it may be  can be viably sustained unless it is undertaken within the framework of a responsibility shared with the international community and  even more important  unless it is backed by appropriate arrangements  a favourable environment and effective international assistance. The task facing the Africans is complex and of considerable scope. It will call for great efforts  indeed sacrifices  on our part. In this respect the new programme for the development of Africa in the 1990s  which is a contract between Africa and its international partners  merits the support of the international community. I cannot disregard the fact that the impressive changes we have mentioned have taken place against a background of rising levels of poverty among vast sectors of the world's population. Redefining international cooperation for development must consequently be the new priority of the multilateral programme. It is thus essential to define a broader approach to this cooperation  one which pays particular attention to the developing countries in general  and to the least developed countries in particular  with a view to achieving sustainable development. The adoption of the Rio Declaration  Agenda 21 and the other agreements reached at the historic Rio Conference demonstrates that the international community is prepared to work in partnership for the protection of the environment and the introduction of a development taking into account the economic equilibrium of all. The ""Spirit of Rio"" has engendered great hopes for the one billion human beings living in extreme deprivation. Now everything depends on the follow-up and implementation of the programmes agreed. The new mechanisms and practical measures to be negotiated during this session of the General Assembly ought  in our view  to permit access by the developing countries to technology and additional financial resources. We express the hope that the pledges to finance the objectives of Agenda 21 will be commensurate with the task; the credibility of the international community is at stake. The new commission on sustainable development  soon to be established  will have to provide the necessary infusion of energy and institute bold policies that will enable us to face the attendant challenges. In conclusion  we in the Republic of Djibouti are confidently awaiting the day when all the peoples of the Horn of Africa will have overcome the spectre of famine and poverty and will live in peace and prosperity. "
"44",1913,"DMA",47,1992,"I am honoured to congratulate Mr. Ganev and his country  Bulgaria  on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are aware that he possesses the qualities and experience required for assuming the responsibility of presiding over the Assembly  and we are therefore confident that he will serve in that capacity with authority  dignity and honour. I assure him of the full cooperation of the delegation of the Commonwealth of Dominica in the discharge of his duties. It is with great pleasure also that I congratulate and welcome Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his election as the sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations. Mr. Boutros-Ghali's election is a contribution by Egypt  Africa and the third world in general to the maintenance of world peace  justice and fundamental human rights. His intellect  integrity  sense of commitment and wide experience in international affairs are qualities which  I have no doubt  will ensure excellence in the performance of his duties. I assure Mr. Boutros-Ghali of the strong support of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of Dominica throughout his term as Secretary-General. Permit me to formally bid farewell to the former Secretary-General of the United Nations  Javier Perez de Cuellar  who gave 10 remarkable years of service to this international body. He will be well remembered for his keen interest in the welfare of humankind and more specifically for his efforts at maintaining world peace. It is my firm belief that his successor will pursue the issues that Mr. Perez de Cuellar hopes will be the main concern of the United Nations in the coming years: maintenance of international peace and security  justice  universalization of human rights  and lessening of the gap between rich and poor nations of the world community. We believe the United Nations should be a truly international body  with universal membership. However  we do not accept the practice of automatic succession. We insist that all new States seeking admission must qualify for membership. Countries seeking admission to this world community must be committed to peace and must accept the obligations of the United Nations Charter: countries which  in the judgement of the Organization  are able and willing to carry out their obligations. It is in this context that we wholeheartedly support the decision to exclude for the time being Serbia and Montenegro from membership of the United Nations  and we welcome other new members from the former Yugoslavia and former Soviet Union. Serbia and Montenegro  on the other hand  by their barbaric acts and flagrant violation of human rights through the practice of ""ethnic cleansing""  have demonstrated a lack of respect for the obligations and principles of this world body. The Commonwealth of Dominica joins the world community in condemning Serbia's acts of violence and aggression against the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and calls for concerted and effective action in defence of the defenceless in those States. While we support unstintingly the resolutions adopted by the Security Council authorizing the use of force to provide humanitarian assistance to the refugees and displaced persons of Bosnia and Herzegovina  and applaud the efforts of different United Nations agencies in that respect  there is need for greater effort to stop Serbian aggression and end the civil war under way in the former Yugoslav Republic. ""Ethnic cleansing"" and violations of international humanitarian law must not be tolerated. Our community of nations cannot be indifferent to the slaughtering of innocent people. Recent trends have demonstrated a weakening  and even a disruption  of the democratic process  as well as widespread violations of human rights not only in Eastern Europe but also in Africa and the Americas. Civil war coupled with the severity of the drought problem has led to famine and death for too many Somalians  and we exhort the United Nations to spare no effort in alleviating the plight of the starving millions of that country. The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica was deeply gratified by the positive outcome of the referendum on reform in South Africa. It seemed to confirm the will of the people of South Africa to move forward rapidly towards an equitable society where all citizens would be offered their God-given dignity and their full right to participate in the affairs of that country. As a sign of support  and in response to the positive vote on the referendum  the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica joined other nations of the Commonwealth in an easing of people-to-people contacts generally. We are however deeply concerned at the persistence of violence and the failure of the South African Government to control it  which undermines and obstructs progress towards democracy and majority rule. We call for a concerted thrust to bring an end to violence  and for a constructive and open dialogue between the Pretoria regime and the African National Congress in an effort to arrive at an early agreement on majority rule. The international community must keep the situation under constant review and should ease economic sanctions against the minority regime in South Africa only in response to firm  significant and irreversible progress towards a democratically elected government based on principles of equality and justice. We hope for an end to all violence and look forward to peaceful progress towards a truly just and democratic system. The situation in Haiti is of particular concern to us in the Americas. The violence and illegal interruption of the democratic process in our sister island has led to continual violations of human rights  increased poverty and suffering of the Haitian people  economic degradation and the fleeing of thousands from their homeland. The subsequent refugee crisis is cause for 9rave concern.  The Organization of American States (OAS) has made significant efforts to restore the democratic system in Haiti  but despite resolutions passed by the OAS General Assembly and a number of missions to Haiti  along with other initiatives  the situation has not been resolved. We urge all States Members of the United Nations to support the decision contained in the OAS resolutions on the restoration of democracy in Haiti and to participate in their effective implementation. The leaks that have enabled the illegal government to survive and even consolidate its position in the face of the embargo must be closed off. In his statement before the United Nations General Assembly in December 1991  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated: ""If there is no development without democracy  there can also be no democracy without development."" (A/46/PV.59. p. 16) The economic situation in Haiti is an issue that needs to be addressed. Labelled the poorest country in the Western hemisphere  Haiti continues to suffer economic deterioration. The Members of the United Nations cannot turn a blind eye to the urgent and basic development needs of Haiti. Our concerted efforts at restoring democracy must be accompanied by plans for immediate improvements in the social and economic conditions of the people of this Caribbean nation. Within this context  Dominica issues a warning that the collapse of the banana industry in Dominica and the Windward Islands  which may be the inevitable consequence of imposing a tariff on bananas under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  would immediately and dramatically adversely affect the economic and social conditions of those small island developing States. We would find ourselves dealing  not with one Haiti  but with three or four in the Caribbean. Such an upheaval could very easily be avoided at no appreciable cost to the basic principles of world trade. What we need is continuing flexibility based on a recognition of the already proclaimed special needs of small island developing countries. Allow me  in the context of the discussion of violations of human rights  to refer to Iraq's flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolution 688 (1991)  which requires Baghdad to end the repression of its citizens and allow access by international humanitarian organizations. It is the responsibility of Iraq as a Member of the United Nations to comply fully with United Nations Security Council resolutions. Iraq's continued violation of these resolutions and continued repression of its civilian population must be condemned. One of the fundamental principles of the United Nations is respect for the sovereignty of each Member State. It is with this in mind that we consider intolerable the assumption that one sovereign State can with impunity commit criminal offences in another sovereign State on the pretext of promoting law enforcement. National sovereignty is not of varying value depending on the size or wealth of the nations. The rule of law must be upheld between States as well as within States.  The quest for the protection of the environment continues to be pursued vigorously  and the efforts of international organizations must be applauded. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio last June  is proof  according to Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali  that nations understand the very fragile nature of the Earth and how very important it is to save our planet. The question to be addressed  then  is how to approach the problem of environmental degradation in a manner which will protect the interests of both developing and industrialized countries. Out of the Earth Summit emerged the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development  consisting of a set of principles aimed at governing the economic and environmental behaviour of individuals and nations in the quest for global sustainability. Agenda 21 covers all areas affecting the relationship between the environment and the economy and deals with the protection of the atmosphere and of the oceans; combating deforestation  desertification and drought; the role of indigenous peoples and women in implementing sustainable development; the meeting of basic human needs; and  very importantly  the transitional patterns of production and consumption in the industrialized countries which would significantly reduce their disproportionate contribution to the deterioration of the Earth's environment. We must be cognizant of the difficulties to be encountered in our attempts to accomplish some of the goals of Agenda 21. The industrialized countries have gained economic prosperity in disregard of the resultant destruction of the environment. The developing countries  for their part  are seeking  belatedly  to raise the standard of living of their populations  primarily through a process of industrialization patterned on the model of the developed countries. That quest will no doubt take its toll on the environment. The responsibility of the industrialized countries to contribute to the progress of the developing countries in a compensatory manner must be recognized. They must compensate for damage to the environment and for injustice to the developing countries. The sovereign right of a country to use its natural resources for its economic development  while respecting the environment and bearing in mind the needs of future generations  must be recognized. Small countries  no less than large ones  have the right to pursue their national interests free from the bullying threats of special-interest groups. Finally  I should like to recall that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali  in his induction speech on 3 December 1991  promised to streamline the operations of the United Nations  ""eliminating what is wasteful and obsolete (A/46/PV.59. p. 16). If our objective of achieving progress towards world peace is to be realized  we must strengthen  not weaken  the ability of the United Nations to provide technical and material assistance to developing countries ""in order to narrow the gap between the rich North and the poor South"" (A/46/PV.59. p. 13). It will also help us to achieve the ""agenda of justice"" which the outgoing Secretary-General  the distinguished diplomat Javier Perez de Cuellar  identified as the dominant concern of the United Nations in the years ahead. The restructuring of the United Nations is a very urgent need. We are living in a dynamic world where  every day  events make heavy demands on the Organization. The United Nations has had to deal with those demands in a rather ad hoc manner  and if it is to become more responsive to the needs of Member States and to function more effectively within the parameters of the Charter  a comprehensive analysis needs to be undertaken immediately and new machinery put in place to make the tasks of preserving world peace and promoting fundamental human rights achievable. During the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  there was much discussion on reforming the Organization. Emphasis was placed on streamlining the Secretariat and increasing the authority of the Secretary-General. There is need at this point to do more in-depth study of the plan worked out by the 22 industrialized and developing countries and of the final report prepared by the Nordic United Nations Project. The important thing is that whatever is done must render the Organization more effective in promoting peace and development throughout the world. Anything less would merely perpetuate the waste of limited resources. It must be made clear that the world cannot long continue on its present path. "
"45",1956,"DNK",47,1992,"Let me begin by congratulating the President upon his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I wish to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. His able and efficient leadership of the United Nations since he took office only nine months ago has impressed us all and I wish to assure him of Denmark's full support of his continuing efforts to reform and streamline the Organization. During the past year the world Organization has become more nearly universal than ever. What in 1945 started out as an organization of 51 Member States has now become an organization consisting of 179 Members. This year 13 new States have joined the United Nations. All the new States of the former Soviet Union  as well as Croatia  Slovenia  Bosnia and Herzegovina and San Marino  have now joined the Organization. Let me take this opportunity to welcome all the new Member States and to express my hope for future fruitful cooperation in the spirit of the United Nations. The very deplorable developments in the former Yugoslavia have demonstrated how fragile the situation is in many parts of the world in the post-cold-war era and have led to the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. The international community has reacted with great responsibility to the intensified crisis in the former Yugoslavia and the overwhelming humanitarian needs it has caused. We have made very large resources available for monitoring  mediation and peace-keeping operations  as well as for humanitarian assistance. I welcome the enlarged role of the United Nations in the peace efforts in the area as well as the central role of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the provision of relief  where coordination remains of paramount significance in ensuring that the relief work is carried out with maximum speed and efficiency. Denmark has worked closely with the High Commissioner in providing very substantial humanitarian assistance  both financially and otherwise. Lately we have accepted a more direct involvement in the provision of accommodation and shelter for refugees and displaced persons. We intend to continue our efforts. The Yugoslav crisis is a crisis in Europe  and Europe is willing and able to take its part of the international responsibility  but the United Nations as the international  global actor has its important role to play as well. The international Conference in London on the former Yugoslavia assembled all the main actors involved in the crisis and war in the region. The results were encouraging. The framework for the absolutely necessary political dialogue and for the negotiations was established  including the structure and the principles upon which any peaceful solution must be based. Developments in the first month after the London conference have shown that the conference was able not only to produce very good documents but also to establish the follow-up mechanism enabling us to turn words into deeds. Denmark wholeheartedly supports the efforts in Geneva under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. Under the impact of all the combined international efforts - the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  the European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM)  the Geneva talks we must not forget that the main responsibility for bringing an end to the cruelties and violence lies with the conflicting parties. All the peoples  groups and minorities and their leaders must realize that the only way their communities can flourish is through a negotiated  commonly accepted political settlement of their disputes. Diverging interests can coexist peacefully only through compromise. The basic principles for a political solution will not change: the inviolability of the borders which can be changed only by mutual  peaceful agreement; the human rights and the rights of minorities must be respected; the sanctions against Serbia-Montenegro will be upheld until the acts of aggression have stopped; the so-called ""Federal Republic of Yugoslavia"" is not the sole successor to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; humanitarian help to all in need shall be possible; persons who have committed crimes against international humanitarian law shall be prosecuted individually  if possible by an international court under the United Nations. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is still grave  but I think we have created the foundations for a possible improvement and eventual settlement. There will be difficulties and backlashes ahead. As Prime Minister Major said at the London Conference  it will be a long haul. But nobody should doubt that Denmark  nationally as well as in its capacity as the next holder of the Presidency of the European Community  will devote all its strength to the international efforts aimed at obtaining a political  peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia. After a period of impressive progress  the reform process in South Africa came to an unfortunate standstill in the middle of this year because of new  tragic outbreaks of violence. The high level of violence remains one of the major obstacles to a resumption of negotiations. The Secretary-General took an important step by sending his Special Representative to South Africa. As a result  a number of United Nations peace observers have been deployed in violence-stricken areas. After a visit earlier this month by the Troika of European Community Foreign Ministers  the European Community has also decided to send peace observers to South Africa. In addition  European experts will support the work of the Goldstone Commission and other efforts to curb the violence in South Africa. At the end of the day  however  only the South Africans themselves can bring about the new  democratic South Africa that we are looking forward to. We stand ready to provide our fullest support. For more than 25 years  Denmark has granted humanitarian assistance to the victims of the apartheid system  and it is prepared to initiate a programme of transitional assistance to South Africa once an interim government is in place. We encourage the international community to join in the efforts to redress the social and economic imbalances in South Africa  and to contribute to the creation of a non-racial and democratic South Africa. The tragedy in Somalia amply illustrates the need for a process of national reconciliation in that country leading to the re-establishment of a legitimate government. Following the visit to Mogadishu by the troika of European Community Foreign Ministers in early September  the European Community Foreign Ministers stressed this  as well as the particularly important role of the United Nations  in their declaration of 13 September. In the Middle East the parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question have embarked on a negotiating process that gives grounds for hopes of a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement. Denmark  together with its European Community partners  fully supports  and remains committed to the peace process. The policy adopted by the new Israeli Government has given a new impetus to this process. The subsequent response of the Arab countries and the Palestinians bodes well for the future. I sincerely hope that all parties will now engage in substantive negotiations by building incrementally on the progress achieved so far. Pragmatism is what counts at the present stage. I therefore call on all parties to translate good intentions into concrete proposals and open-mindedness. In Iraq the Baghdad regime continues to ignore its obligations under international law by obstructing the work of United Nations inspection teams. The regime is continuing its flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms  in particular by victimizing Kurds and Arab Shiites living in the marshes. And Baghdad is actively impeding the efforts of the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to relieve the plight of those suffering. The harassment of United Nations peace guards  the refusal to renew the Memorandum of Understanding and the rejection of the food-for-oil arrangements laid down in Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991) are all cases in point. Saddam Hussein's strategy  however  is doomed to failure. In no circumstances will the international community relax the United Nations sanctions imposed on the Baghdad regime unless it fully and unconditionally complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions. In my speech last autumn I pointed out how Security Council resolution 688 (1991) might become a turning point as to the balance between the principle of national sovereignty and that of humanitarian intervention. The question of humanitarian intervention has had a considerable impact on international debate during the last year. The course of events in Somalia  the former Yugoslavia and recently  anew  in Iraq has shown the relevance and importance of the concept. There seems to me to be growing support for the point of view that the principle of non-intervention in the internal jurisdiction of States cannot be taken as a shield behind which massive violations of human rights can be allowed to take place  especially not where the human rights situations have been characterized by the Security Council as a threat to peace. A new balance between sovereignty and international intervention is being struck  in favour of international intervention. My Government welcomes that development. We should insist on recognition of the basic principle that Governments have to cooperate fully to ensure access to all persons in need of assistance. Far too often political motives continue to prevent humanitarian assistance from entering a country or from reaching population groups in need of such assistance. It has been appalling to witness the continuing disregard for humanitarian conventions shown by Iraq during the Gulf War  and  most recently  by parties to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The perpetrators of these criminal acts are individually responsible  and must be prosecuted individually. In this connection I welcome the work of the International Law Commission on the question of establishing an international criminal tribunal. The Danish Government is ready to contribute constructively in these efforts during this and the coming session of the General Assembly. The Secretary-General's report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) contains a number of interesting proposals  some of which Denmark can support wholeheartedly: for example  the proposal to make wider use of good offices  the proposal to establish a reserve fund for peace-keeping operations and the proposal to make wider use of the International Court of Justice. However  both the use of the good offices of the Secretary-General and the use of the International Court depend on the political will of the parties involved. The United Nations is facing steadily growing demands for peace-keeping efforts  and the scope of these efforts is increasing. Suffice it to mention Cambodia  Somalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the United Nations is already heavily overburdened  we welcome the Secretary-General's call upon European regional organizations to carry out peace-keeping functions in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter  as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Despite the substantial Danish contribution to the United Nations Protection Force  we remain committed to further contributions to United Nations peace-keeping operations  both in Europe and in other parts of the world. Let me add  however  that a peace-keeping operation must be seen as an interim offer to the parties to a conflict  and thus must be limited to a few years. A peace-keeping operation must never  by the mere length of its existence  turn out to be an excuse for the parties not to seek a negotiated settlement of their dispute. In fulfilling its mandate as the guardian of peace  the United Nations has an important role to play by contributing to social and economic development and the eradication of poverty. The significant role that the United Nations has acquired in efforts to solve political conflicts should not overshadow its responsibilities in the economic and social field. As pointed out by the Secretary-General  no lasting peace can be achieved while the existing gap between rich and poor nations persists. The improved international political climate  the breakup of the old power blocs and the reductions in military expenditures offer a unique opportunity to promote social development. We must now face our responsibility to improve living conditions for the more than one billion people living in absolute poverty  and for the even larger number of people suffering under unemployment and social insecurity. If we do not  problems will multiply and put global stability at risk. The solutions to those problems must be based on respect for human rights  the rule of law and political institutions that are effective  accountable and enjoy democratic legitimacy. It is time to face  discuss and tackle these interlinking aspects of social development. Denmark welcomes the proposal adopted by the Economic and Social Council to convene in 1995 a world summit for social development. We intend to propose Copenhagen as venue for the world social summit  thereby confirming Denmark's commitment to social development and our wish to make the summit an important event in the mobilization of all efforts to attain the ultimate objective to improve the quality of life of man. This year  the General Assembly will undertake a review of the operational activities of the United Nations system. It will give us an opportunity to assess the functioning of the development activities of the United Nations system during the past three years  and establish new guidelines and priorities for the coming three years. At the same time  discussions of fundamental reforms of the United Nations system as such have entered an important stage which gives an excellent opportunity for a comprehensive discussion of the demands of the emerging new world order as they relate to the. structure and functioning of the United Nations and its Secretariat. At the centre of the reform discussions is the need for a clearer definition of the role of the United Nations system in development activities  including better distribution of work and improved coordination among the various organizations. The United Nations must also show leadership in this field and carry out its own operational activities in a consistent and coherent manner. Progress in the discussions of reforms of the United Nations operational activities was made at the recent session of the Economic and Social Council. It is our hope that at this year's session the General Assembly will bring the process forward from the level of discussing principles to that of concrete action. The proposals contained in the Nordic United Nations project would  in our view  enable the United Nations to regain its rightful leading role in operational development activities. Only through substantial changes in the governance and financing of United Nations funds and programmes will it be possible to ensure a more effective and efficient role for the United Nations in this field  to the benefit of developing nations. During the last few years  we have seen a succession of natural and man-made disasters of unprecedented frequency  scope and complexity. After the extraordinary events of last year  we all hoped to see a reversal of this trend in 1992. Unfortunately  such hopes have not been fulfilled. The adoption of resolution 46/182 on emergency assistance at last year's session was seen as a major step forward in the direction of improved coordination within the United Nations system and increased efficiency in the delivery of humanitarian emergency assistance. It was an important step. However  much more needs to be done to translate the aims of that resolution into reality. The public criticism which has been raised in many countries  including in Denmark  of the response of the United Nations system to the large-scale tragedy in Somalia is an example which makes it clear that this year the General Assembly must give increased and renewed attention to the issue of improved performance by the United Nations. A determined effort must now be made to ensure that sufficient humanitarian assistance is given in time  with maximum speed  and in a well coordinated manner. We appeal in particular to the organizations of the United Nations family to try harder to cooperate  act jointly and compete less. The World Conference on Human Rights  scheduled to take place in June next year  will provide an opportunity to review progress made in the field of human rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration. Obstacles to further progress will be identified  and specific measures which can assist individual countries in their efforts to promote respect for human rights will be outlined. The Danish Government is committed to ensuring a successful outcome to the Conference  and will work for a balanced result containing both political benchmarks and operational guidelines for corresponding implementation activities. In this regard  special attention should be paid to the interlinkages between democracy  human rights and development and to the need for a concentrated assistance effort in this area  based on the principle that violations of human rights are a legitimate concern of the international community. Democracy  respect for human rights  equal status for men and women and principles of good governance play an essential role in development efforts. This has been increasingly recognized in recent years  and reflected both in the wide-ranging reforms undertaken in a number of countries and in the continued policy dialogue aimed at supporting development efforts. At the same time  the process towards broadening public participation in the decision-making processes is bound to continue. The Danish Government will seek to assist countries undertaking policy reforms in establishing administrative and political structures which are conducive to development for instance  by setting up new democratic institutions and by strengthening the rule of law. Equally we attach great importance to the question of military spending. Excessive military spending not only reduces funds available for other purposes  but can also contribute to increased regional tensions and violations of international law  and can in some cases compromise moves towards democracy and the rule of law at the domestic level. Denmark stands ready  through its programme for development assistance  to provide substantial support for specific activities aimed at consolidating human rights  democracy and good governance  and we shall seek our future partners in development from amongst countries which are making a genuine effort in this regard. Next year has also been designated the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. The Danish Government looks forward with great interest and high hopes to that Year  and plans are well under way both in Greenland and in Denmark on how to work actively towards increasing the understanding of the special situation facing these peoples and how to further the respect for the cultures and rights of indigenous peoples. It is well known that the Inuit  the inhabitants of Greenland  have chosen the status of home rule within the Danish realm  and at the domestic level we will cooperate closely with the representatives of the home-rule Government of Greenland in our preparations for the Year. The results the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development recently achieved in Rio provide a good basis for a new global partnership based on common responsibility for the Earth  even if it did not meet all our expectations. The Rio Declaration  Agenda 21 and the Conventions on climate change and biodiversity are far from being the end result: they are instruments to mobilize governments and peoples from all over the world in a joint effort towards sustainable development in the future. The most significant institutional recommendation of the Conference to be followed up at the international level is the high-level Commission on Sustainable Development. It is important that the Commission's scope of work be oriented towards the future in order to ensure a dynamic approach to future technological and economic developments. Implementation of Agenda 21 and the conventions requires financial resources and thus calls for partnership and real burden-sharing among nations  not only between North and South but also among the donor countries themselves. From the very beginning  the Danish Government has been committed to the process of the United Nations Conference and Environment and Development. We are prepared to provide our fair share of the necessary resources  and would like to see similar firm commitments from as many countries as possible. At this session we are marking the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. The disabled remain among the most vulnerable groups  in particular in the developing countries. During the Decade awareness of the problems and difficulties facing disabled persons all over the world has been increased. Much however  still remains to be done. The development organizations of the United Nations should play an important role in this respect by integrating the needs of disabled persons more strategically in the regular programming of their activities. Let me end by stating the obvious: we all wish the United Nations success in the reform process and in carrying out its many tasks. But that wish must be accompanied by a willingness to live up to our legal obligation to pay our contributions to the Organization and to do so in full and on time. "
"46",2001,"DOM",47,1992," Permit me to begin. Sir  by taking this opportunity to convey to you the congratulations of the delegation of the Dominican Republic on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Coming from a region that is taking on a new dimension in the international community  you will no doubt take a realistic view of the major challenges posed by the world situation. You have first-hand experience of the transformations taking place in the world. You are thus superbly qualified to guide with composure the deliberations of the Assembly. We wish also to pay a warm tribute to the distinguished Saudi diplomat. His Excellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi  the outgoing President  for his skill and for the fruitful results he achieved in his work. On the new international landscape  with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism  the likelihood of a world war has vanished. But in many regions it remains possible that conflicts of an unpredictable nature could take place. Hence the international community should remain vigilant  because though it is true that the danger of nuclear war has disappeared  it is no less true that another menace is still with us  that of the continued quest  on the part of some countries  for technology for the production of nuclear weaponry  behind the back of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The Agency deserves to be revitalized so that it will be able to work effectively in its efforts to prevent the proliferation of those terrible weapons. Mankind is still burdened with problems arising out of the so-called conventional weapons  which are becoming more and more destructive  and what is needed is a degree of international control to limit them. That would make available resources that  if properly used  could contribute to the development of the countries of the third world  which are already suffering because of heavy public debt and restrictive and protectionist measures impeding international trade. That is the most important challenge facing mankind  and this forum is the right place to discuss those issues and create conditions and lay down guidelines to improve the lot of the two thirds of mankind that today finds itself threatened  not only by the economic crisis and the inequalities between North and South but also by the continued deterioration of the environment  which has been degraded by our own deliberate or unwitting use and abuse of it. I have expressed these thoughts because I come from a country  the Dominican Republic  that is small in size  with an area of only 48 400 square kilometres and a population of 7 500 000  and we feel the ill effects of the problems I have mentioned: burdensome external debt and declining trade because of restrictive and protectionist practices in the countries to which we export our agricultural products  whose prices are constantly falling in world markets. Our adverse trade situation means that we are losing significant resources that could be devoted to our development. Nevertheless  over the last two years the Dominican economy has undergone a successful process of adjustment that has made it possible to eliminate inflation  stabilize the national currency and bring the budgetary deficit under control  all as a result of the adoption of a restrictive monetary policy. This has helped to rebuild confidence in the production sectors. We believe that confidence in our country's business sector in the immediate future is indispensable for the achievement of an accelerated and sustained recovery of the Dominican economy. Even more important in that regard is the country's ability in the short term to increase the foreign-exchange income that it needs for its development  at a time when the export of raw materials is being replaced by service-sector products. The Dominican Republic is now pursuing closer ties with the States members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM)  with a view to bringing about our definitive entrance into CARICOM  on the basis of the great significance that the Dominican Government attaches at this time to the achievement of a more advantageous position vis-a-vis the European Economic Community as a State member of the Lome Convention  and the Dominican Republic is thus aiming to bring about greater openness in markets when it comes to selling its products internationally. The achievements of the Dominican Republic  despite the grave economic crisis suffered in recent years by Latin American and Caribbean countries  have been the result of good government  presided over by Dr. Joaquin Balaguer  a champion of democracy who gives us an example of what a leader can do with the scant resources of a poor State when they are used judiciously to create conditions favourable to the people. Those achievements include  among other things  the construction of thousands of dwellings  hundreds of kilometres of highways and local roads  as well as schools and hospitals to provide vital social services to a constantly growing population. Let me now turn to the situation of our fraternal neighbour  Haiti. Unfortunately  throughout its existence as an independent country Haiti has endured a chronic situation of economic penury and the impoverishment of its soil. This has forced its population to emigrate in waves across our borders and by sea in search of a better life. Today that situation is made even more tragic by the political crisis our Haitian brothers are going through. The Dominican authorities and people are not indifferent to that situation  which stems from the COUP d'etat that cut short President Aristide's experiment in democracy. That development was condemned by the Organization of American States (OAS)  which imposed a trade embargo to compel the current authorities to restore legality. So far as the Dominican Government  presided over by Mr. Joaquin Balaguer  is concerned  negotiation and dialogue within the context of absolute respect for the norms of international law are the most appropriate instruments in the quest for peace. Accordingly  we have been and continue to be providing disinterested support to all the parties to the conflict  in the hope that a solution that would resolve existing differences can be found and that all institutions in the Republic of Haiti can again function normally. Our Government is deeply democratic  respects human rights and jealously guards its prerogative of guaranteeing the liberties of those inhabiting the Republic. We deplore the fragmentation of the former Yugoslavia as well as the tragedy that has befallen its people. Bereft of any guarantee of their rights  they are suffering the onslaught of a tragic fratricidal war that is taking a heavy toll in human lives  particularly those of women and children  who are subjected to constant air attacks and shellings and are deprived of the food and medicine they need in order to subsist and treat their wounds and illnesses. We support the measures adopted by the United Nations with regard to the former Yugoslavia  measures that urge the parties to respect human rights and forcefully condemn the loathsome practice of ""ethnic cleansing"". It is a source of satisfaction to my delegation to see the communication that is developing between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  aimed at reuniting the Korean family. We regret  however  that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is persisting in its nuclear research with the aim of building nuclear weapons. By the same token  we are optimistic about the situation developing among the Arab peoples and the people of Israel  and we hope that this atmosphere of dialogue and negotiation will gain even greater momentum so that those concerned may live in peace and harmony on their lands while moving towards a future of prosperity and progress. Though the cold war is a thing of the past  the danger and the tragedy of regional conflicts are still with us. Settling those conflicts requires international cooperation and the good will of the parties involved. However  another serious threat to peace and to the well-being of our peoples still faces the Americas and other parts of the world. We refer here to drug trafficking and the destruction and social and moral harm which that scourge entails for all our communities. Our country supports every single measure taken by the United Nations to cope with this serious problem  and calls for continued efforts to resolve and do away with this global scourge. In this vein  the Dominican Republic has been taking forceful steps to confront this evil  pursuing a dynamic drug-abuse-prevention drive and at the same time launching major administrative  legislative and judicial initiatives  not only against drug production  but also against the marketing of and the trafficking in drugs. Moreover  we have signed bilateral accords along these lines with countries in our region and are in the final phase of preparations leading to our accession to the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The facts in terms of the state of the environment the world over are growing ever more alarming and must be a source of concern to  and a reason for solidarity among  all States Members of the Organization. Because of interdependence  damage done to the environment anywhere in the world has an impact upon us all. Accordingly  international cooperation is necessary so that the States of the third world as well as the industrialized nations can strive together to ensure that present and future generations will be able to enjoy a clean planet Earth  where life will be easier and happier. The Dominican Government  aware of these facts  has embarked on a process of reforesting our country and of conserving our natural resources. We support whatever steps the international community may take along these lines  and  to demonstrate this  we are submitting to the Congress of our Republic  with a view to accession  the 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer  along with its Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. At this point  we should like to refer to the matter of racial discrimination  yet another major problem that still shocks the conscience of humankind and continues to represent a major challenge to and violation of the most elementary norms of human rights. In this sense  our country has repeatedly  in this very forum  stated its rejection and repudiation of the apartheid system. Two years ago  right here  we expressed satisfaction at the announcement by the President of South Africa  Frederick de Klerk  of the recognition of the rights of other races in that country to ensure that an end would be put to the system of apartheid. However  today racial tensions continue to escalate  and it is not possible to discern any rapid progress in the process of change in South Africa. The policy of apartheid constitutes a crime against the conscience and the dignity of human beings and  therefore  it must be totally eliminated  so that a genuine democracy  based on a multi-ethnic and pluralist system  may be established in South Africa. The 1990s have begun with great frustration  but also with great hope frustration because of the stagnation or backsliding in terms of social progress  which the 1980s left as a legacy to the majority of developing countries; hope because what is taking place is a real revolution in thinking  which makes imperative a review and a revision of proposals for the promotion of development. In the economic arena  there is a constant search for ways and means of fostering the resumption of growth and modernization  as well as the more active participation of those countries in the world economy. The data on the social condition of the majority of the world's population  and the possibility that those data may worsen as a result of economic measures that have been adopted  have made it necessary to place the issue of the social dimension in the world at the heart of our debate. The concept that social issues are a secondary matter  in contrast with the primary process taking place in political forums  is a grave and extremely costly mistake. In fact  if we do not deal with the social problems they turn very quickly into political problems. The groan of hunger does more than break the silence; eventually it rends peace asunder. That is why the Dominican Republic backs unreservedly the convening of a world summit for social development. We take the view that the concept of human security  which that proposal reflects  refers directly to the important - indeed  the overriding task facing all societies: the provision of food  clothing and housing in quantities sufficient for all  while promoting social progress in harmony with the environment  and supporting those institutions that respond to the noblest aspirations that human beings cherish throughout their lives. Even if only in terms strictly of a cost-benefit analysis  it is cheaper to deal with social problems now. Dealing with them later involves paying the price of social upheaval. We literally cannot afford to ignore that truth. We have great pleasure in taking advantage of this opportunity to reaffirm our resolute support for the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. The Dominican Republic is profoundly committed to the success of that body. Today  the United Nations constitutes that ecumenical  common forum where we set forth our ideas as we seek solutions intended to bring about a better life in the world in which we live a world free from discrimination and waste. It is our desire to see the work of this Organization revitalized so that it may be able more effectively to do its job and live up to its obligations. We give it our fullest support  and we express our faith and hope in universal peace and harmony. "
"47",2048,"DZA",47,1992,"Your election to the presidency of the General Assembly  Sir  is a tribute to you and to your country  friendly Bulgaria  which has risen to the challenges of the times with a combination of determination and wisdom. Your qualities as a statesman  which you have amply demonstrated  and your skills as a seasoned diplomat are solid assets which ensure the success of our work. I wish to congratulate you most warmly on your election to this post and to assure you of our complete support and cooperation. I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  Ambassador of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  who guided the forty-sixth session of our Assembly with a competence  distinction  and effectiveness that I wish to emphasize today with pride. Another source of legitimate pride for us is the work accomplished by the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Only a few months have gone by since he began his term of office  and already the record is impressive. There can be no doubt that Mr. Boutros-Ghali has brought to the United Nations a spirit of initiative  determination  and lucid leadership which it needs so much to face the challenges posed by the fast pace of history at this century's end. The Agenda for Peace  his first annual report  along with his major statements and his remarks before the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and at the Jakarta summit of non-aligned countries  bespeak his vision and courage  which command our full support and esteem. I cannot fail to reiterate here our congratulations to all the new Members of the United Nations and to welcome them to this forum. Bearing as it does so much hope and promise  the end of the cold war and of the bipolar division of the world has not yet realized any of the hopes it has given rise to with regard to the promotion of peace and international cooperation. The spectre of war  the horror of famine and privation  the trampling of human dignity  and the denial of the right of peoples to self-determination still constitute the realities of the plight of many peoples. In fact  the so-called world order remains a concept without substance for the overwhelming majority of mankind  whose economic and social situation is steadily deteriorating and who also have reason to fear that this new order is being established outside the bounds of the basic principles of the United Nations charter and without meeting the need to democratize international relations. It is time to embark upon a genuine dialogue in order to shape the international relations of the future. This is a vital task of the United  Nations  and the Organization's current prestige makes us believe that the time is ripe to embark upon such an enterprise. Never before has the United Nations seen so many hopes crystallized around it; never has it undertaken so many initiatives or put so many plans on the drawing board. Whether the United Nations initiatives and plans are met by acceptance and praise as is often the case  or criticized  as sometimes happens  it is a fact that this more assertive presence of the United Nations is one of the most positive results of the major changes that have taken place on the international arena in recent years. The Security Council summit held last January  the proposals submitted by the Secretary-General  the debates in the Economic and Social Council last July on the role of the United Nations system in the strengthening of international cooperation for development  and the results of the 10th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held at the beginning of this month in Jakarta are all contributions to the joint thinking and action aimed at strengthening the United Nations and promoting its effectiveness. It is hoped that this session of the General Assembly will be a new starting-point for the United Nations that will place it resolutely on the path of greater democratization and enhance its effectiveness in promoting peace  cooperation and development. This is exactly what has been called for in the Jakarta Message  which was presented right here by the current President of the Non-Aligned Movement  His Excellency President Suharto of Indonesia. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has more than ever a positive role to play in the establishment  through dialogue and the harmonization of views  of a just  well-balanced world order which ensures international peace and security  the right to development  and the promotion of more equitable economic relations. The United Nations constitutes a natural and privileged space for the action of the Non-Aligned  who intend in this way to participate fully in the current process of restructuring and strengthening the United Nations. In this respect  restructuring initiatives should first of all aim at achieving a correct balance of prerogatives between the General Assembly and the Security Council. This undertaking should also meet the need to allow access to the Council for all major cultural  political and geographic groupings. Algeria  which  since its independence  has undergone major transformations in all areas and which has taken significant steps towards progress and development  today faces a crisis which we do not underestimate and whose seriousness we in no way conceal. This crisis threatens the achievements made by our people through effort and sacrifice over three long decades. While analyzing without any self-indulgence the causes of this crisis  and while in no way trying to deny our own mistakes or the responsibilities of the State in this situation  we affirm confidently and with determination that our people has the means  capacity and will to overcome this crisis and to embark again on global development and the building of a society based on social justice and real democracy. This is the substance of the message behind the program of government approved recently by the High Committee of State. This responsible posture in the face of those challenges permits us to recall as well the external constraints that have worsened the difficulties we face. This means that we expect our partners to cooperate readily in order to reduce the negative impact of an unfavorable external environment  or at least that they not hamper the efforts of our people. Algeria pursues a non-aligned policy aimed at promoting stability  peace  justice and cooperation in the region to which it belongs and in the world at large. In the Mediterranean  Algeria works for a new era of solidarity that responds to the aspirations of the peoples on both coasts of this great shared interior sea. Mechanisms for regular consultation and dialogue have been set up in order to promote the establishment of a comprehensive framework for peace  security  good-neighbourliness  solidarity and mutually advantageous cooperation. The united Maghreb process which is rallying the energies of the member countries of the Arab Maghreb Union and which constitutes a fundamental aspiration of their peoples cannot but contribute to serving the cause of peace  relations of good-neighbourliness and cooperation between its different members and in the Mediterranean basin  the Arab world  and Africa. There are two issues that are of special importance to my country. Participation by the international community is required in dealing with both. For the first of these  we wholeheartedly call for a peaceful solution  in consonance with international legality  to the situation of tension that exists between Libya and the major Western Powers. It is a situation that stands in the way of the building of the Arab Maghreb and threatens the stability of the whole region. The international community should respond to the flexibility that characterizes the Libyan posture and to the initiatives and proposals that have been put forth. On the other hand  the delays in the implementing the United Nations settlement plan for the organization of a self-determination referendum for the people of the Western Sahara continue to be the source of grave concern for us and for the international community as a whole. Algeria hopes that the two parties to the conflict will refrain from any action that could hamper or delay the implementation of the peace plan prepared jointly by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity with the full agreement of both parties. Algeria also hopes that the international community  through the United Nations and its Secretary-General  will redouble its efforts to implement the plan in order to reach the desired solution. Of late  there have been positive developments in the disarmament issue. However  we look forward to a great deal of additional effort on the part of the nuclear States  which  we must state not the major Powers alone. In this context  we note with satisfaction the conclusion of negotiations on the issue of a chemical weapons Convention in Geneva. However  this development will have limited effects so long as it is not accompanied by concrete measures in the field of nuclear disarmament  especially in a region as sensitive as the Middle East  where a real nuclear threat persists.  Only if earnest efforts are made in this direction and significant progress is achieved will that Convention - the conclusion of which is an accomplishment that we commend - respond to the concerns and expectations of all the parties concerned. Only then will it be possible to implement the Convention on a just non-discriminatory basis will and  thereby  ensure the universal acceptance necessary to this undertaking of genuine disarmament. These were the observations and legitimate concerns expressed by the Arab countries through a resolution adopted a few days ago  which they expect the international community to take into account. In spite of the significant progress achieved in the field of disarmament  it remains true that to address the issue of security in a manner that focuses on one specific region and shows concern for the security of the few without taking into account the interests and concerns of the many is to fall short of the objectives and ideals enshrined in the United Nations Charter. That is why the Non-Aligned Movement has just reaffirmed the unshakeable conviction of all its members that there is no peace or security other than peace and security for all  and that in order for peace and security to be lasting they must be addressed in all their dimensions and not only in the military aspects. In an increasingly interdependent world  peace and security should not be dissociated from their corollaries  namely economic development and the upholding of human rights. While we express satisfaction at the progress achieved in the settlement of certain regional disputes  we note with concern the emergence of new crises in the wake of the cold war  at a time when many of the old crises and issues continue to await just and lasting solutions. Cambodia has embarked upon a process of peaceful settlement thanks to the will of the Cambodian people to  build for themselves a future of peace and harmony  to the determination of the international community and the efforts of the United Nations which now supervises the implementation of a peace plan with the participation of Algeria. The inter-community talks on Cyprus  under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  have reached a crucial stage. We hope that the remaining differences will be ironed out during the next round of talks  in a context of respect for the sovereignty  unity  territorial integrity  and the non-aligned nature of the island. The recent news that has reached us from South Africa revives hope that there will be a resumption of the process that began with the release of Nelson Mandela  President of the African National Congress and was endangered in recent months by the return of violence encouraged by the complacent attitude of the Government. While we welcome such positive developments and the encouraging prospects that pave the road toward the desired solution  we must stress that the experience of recent months makes it necessary to closely monitor developments in South Africa with a great deal of watchfulness and to lend full support to our brethren in that country. The horrific plight of the Somali people is a glaring example of the deteriorating situation in many parts of Africa  a continent that has been increasingly marginalized and whose role has been greatly diminished. It is essential to learn a lesson from this tragedy  which underscores the need for urgent humanitarian assistance for the Somali people side by side with the intensification of United Nations efforts to reach a political settlement to this crisis. The question of Palestine continues to be the crux of the Middle East conflict. Given our firm commitment to Palestine's freedom of choice  has accepted the option chosen by the Palestinian leadership that has made it possible to negotiate with a view to reaching a solution to the Middle East crisis. We in Algeria remain convinced that the success of the negotiations  begun within the framework of the process initiated in Madrid  depends on readiness by Israel to comply with international legality  especially in regard to the following: First  United Nations resolutions must be adhered to and implemented. Secondly  the operations of settlement in the occupied Arab territories must be halted and existing Israeli settlements must be dismantled. Thirdly  the continuity of the different stages of the peace process must be guaranteed until a comprehensive solution is found that would guarantee to the Palestinian people the exercise of its full national rights  including its right to self-determination and to the establishment of its own State on its territory with Al-Quds as its capital. My country is convinced that participation by the United Nations in every stage of this peace process in the Middle East can contribute to the attainment of the objective that would guarantee a just comprehensive peace in the region.  We emphasize once again that the Palestinian problem and the Middle East conflict are one and the same thing. They are indivisible. Consequently  the solution which must be found cannot be partial or limited to certain parties involved in the conflict. In other words  and peace can be established in the region only if it is peace for all the parties concerned  including the Palestinians. Algeria wishes to reaffirm here its commitment to the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon within its internationally recognized borders. It condemns the continued Israeli occupation of part of southern Lebanon as well as Israel's repeated attacks against Lebanon's territory and its people. We demand the total and unconditional withdrawal of the Israeli army from southern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978). We also reaffirm the need to preserve Iraq's unity and territorial integrity. It must be clear to all that any negative development in this respect will create grave problems for all the countries of the region. It is our hope that respect for international legality will lead to reconciliation between the States of that region which continues to suffer the horrific consequences of the devastating war that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. In the same region  there has been another development whose gravity cannot be underestimated. It is Iran's illegal occupation of the island of Abu Mousa thus reneging on its commitments and agreements concluded with the United Arab Emirates. We support the demand of the Government of the United Arab Emirates that the unilateral measures taken by Iran be nullified and that a solution to the problem be found through negotiation in observance of legality and international law. In the face of the terrible plight of the peoples of former Yugoslavia  the major imperative on which all efforts should focus is to ensure the immediate return of peace to all of the territory of the former Yugoslavia  with respect for the independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the republics that have emerged therefrom. In this respect  the situation which persists in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a source of grave concern because of the increasingly terrible crimes that are being committed there. The international community  and in particular the United Nations  must take every measure necessary in order to put an end to the plight of the entire Bosnian people and to the threats to peace and security in the region. One of the most disturbing aspects of the current world situation is the constant exacerbation of the economic situation of the developing countries and negative developments that continue to rock the world's economy. The sharp slow-down in the growth of world trade  which declined from 8 per cent in 1988 to barely 3 per cent in 1991  the increasing deterioration in the prices of raw materials at an average 15 per cent pace in real terms in 1990  the persistence of the foreign debt problem of the developing countries with the attendant acceleration of the slow-down of growth in the developed countries  and the magnitude of the financial needs of the former USSR and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  show how great are the challenges to be met. Given the new opportunities and the new challenges to be met in this period of profound change  the revitalization of international cooperation for development and strengthening the role of the United Nations system in this undertaking should be the high-priority task of the day.  This requires first and foremost the existence of real political will. Some progress has been achieved in this direction. The declaration by the Security Council at its summit meeting last January recognized the close relationship that exists between peace and development. This recognition should be translated into increased agreement on the need to move the economic and social dimension from the secondary position it now occupies to the forefront and to make it a principal and permanent concern of the United Nations. In fact  at a time when a great deal of thinking is taking place on the concept and the instruments of preventive diplomacy  the success of renewed growth and development in the countries of the South affect the credibility and the effectiveness of any attempt to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the areas of international peace and security. The results of the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) held at Cartagena in February of 1992  the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de Janeiro last June  and the General Assembly's adoption of a new United Nations agreement for the development of Africa in the 1990s  all constitute new milestones in our awareness of international interdependence and the need for renewed international cooperation. One of the basic objectives that we must strive to attain in this particularly difficult situation in the third world is the need to ensure a bigger share in world trade for the developing countries  the formulation of a comprehensive strategy that addresses the issue of indebtedness and the reactivation of the flow of funds and investments from the developed to the developing countries. In general  the creation of favourable external conditions is a vital requirement in the case of the developing countries which are trying to carry out wide-ranging fundamental reforms at a very high social and political cost. This is a basic requirement on which the United Nations system should mobilize the international community. The implementation of ""Agenda 21"" and the commitments that arise therefrom  especially with regard to financial support and transfer of technology  represent a major test both of the political will of the developed countries and of the capacity of our Organization  through the Commission on Sustainable Development  to ensure the implementation  follow-up and coordination of a programme which aims at bringing about real and creative changes in the concept of development and international cooperation. There are new and vast horizons before the United Nations. Those horizons give the work of this session of the Assembly particular importance and substance. The international community must seize the opportunity to develop at this world forum an integrated approach to the promotion of peace  security  and stability in economic and social development and international cooperation. In so doing  it would contribute to the optimum utilization of our Organization's great potential. "
"48",2095,"ECU",47,1992,"I wish to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your well-deserved election to guide our endeavours during this session of the General Assembly. Similarly  I extend to the Secretary-General my congratulations on his having assumed his important office at a time when the international community is going through substantial changes  and when it needs  in that high post  an experienced and brilliant diplomat such as he. He has succeeded Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar  an illustrious Latin American who discharged the duties of the office with great effectiveness  as the new era required. My presence here  so soon after assuming the Presidency of my country  must be taken as a clear sign of the enormous importance we attach to the United Nations  its principles and its work  which is increasingly far-reaching and truly valuable  work that is essentially that of keeping the peace and  also  of course  bringing about the economic and social development of all the peoples on Earth. The latter task is particularly important for Ecuador  which is striving to overcome underdevelopment and achieve decent living conditions for its people  particularly the great majorities. To that end  we have begun to restructure the State  and we have already prescribed some economic measures that will require sacrifice on the part of my compatriots  but that will soon have positive effects. The current international situation  stemming from the end of the cold war  could be said to oscillate between disappointment and hope. There seems to exist something more than a truce between ideological rivalries  which we hope will lead us to a truer understanding among nations; and with the lessening influence of the private interests of individuals and nations  we hope it will give way to an international equilibrium which will allow us to forge ahead  together  towards universal  stable and lasting peace. That circumstance explains the special importance of the fact that  in international life  respect for the human being has assumed top priority and man finds himself exalted  raised to heights never enjoyed until a few decades ago. But the continued enjoyment of such a position  despite the discontinuities still existing in certain corners of the world  requires the constant political commitment of States  which  fortunately  is widespread  to the unconditional implementation of the constitutional and conventional norms that reinforce that conquest at its various levels. Speaking of human rights  my Government is firmly and irrevocably resolved to apply  both domestically and internationally  a policy of full respect for  and defence of  those very rights  in consonance with the dignity of man  as a tribute to his spirituality and in clear recognition of his transcendental values. Respect for human rights is not a gracious concession that Governments make to their peoples  but rather an unwritten  intrinsic obligation of democracy and civil life. The opposite is barbarism  the denial  of some men by others; it is the action of the few who  using the power given to them by the community for the common good  distort it and turn it into the supreme evil of pitting man against man. My Government will use any and all means in the prevention against such ignominy. Moreover  one can see that the world community has emphasized  out of a concept of solidarity  not only the promotion of human rights but also the rendering of humanitarian assistance to those most in need of it  and has found itself searching for ever more effective mechanisms to extend such assistance to all corners of the Earth  wherever violence or natural disasters continue to breed hunger and despair. Despite the fact that we find ourselves in an ever more interdependent world where it is essential that cooperation not be linked to specific political interests  a world where integration is and must be the language which best expresses the hopes of peoples  we still face positions that prevent economic relations from being equitable to and supportive of developing countries within the effective exercise of the principle of international free trade  towards which my Government is working and will work according to a plan. The success of this new course will depend greatly not only on immense domestic efforts but also on the necessary alignment of the theory of international solidarity with the real  sincere and favourable response of the international community  and on the understanding of the industrialized countries concerning the need to settle  on mutually agreeable terms  the problem of the external debt of the least developed countries  whose burden is another of the serious difficulties preventing those countries from developing and attaining better living standards. It would be most promising were an agreement reached on the mechanisms for alleviating this problem  which is at the same time economic and financial  and a problem whose repercussions in the social and political fields no one now denies. Among such mechanisms  those aimed at converting external debt into investment  especially in development projects  both social and economic  should be pressed forward. Fortunately the dark atomic threat is disappearing. The agreements and undertakings which  with a new vision of the very destiny of mankind  have the aim of eliminating nuclear arms  are a source of hope. At the same time  they can be the means by which  by eliminating the enormous waste of resources  we may help to solve economic and social problems and embark upon a process of frank cooperation with nations that are in the greatest need of help to raise their standards of living. Notwithstanding these positive advances and these undertakings  we look to the future with concern  as the new situation resulting from the historic circumstances of the last two years has not managed to prevent the outburst of bloody regional conflicts. Nationalist extremists have produced the phenomenon of the exceptionally violent disintegration of States  and in such a climate new calamities and hardships have arisen. A responsible approach to the common obligations of mankind is now more important than ever before. The world has shrunk physically and in terms of human relationships. The problems of a particular State affect other States in various ways and make it necessary that we take remedial action in a spirit of solidarity. Meanwhile  the old problems of disparity between an economically powerful world  embracing a limited number of countries  and the developing world  comprising the bulk of mankind  continue to worsen. Insufficient funding for development has become endemic  making necessary decisions on a global basis. Moreover  the insufficiency of funding means that all States must carry a fair share of the load. Without help  poor States cannot free themselves from their condition of impoverishment  and they cannot partake in the enjoyment of a life of dignity  free from the fear of insecurity and poverty. For this reason  we firmly support the convening of an international conference on the financing of development  in order to alleviate in some way the situation of the great number of States that urgently need extensive economic assistance. Felipe Herrera  the Chilean to whom Latin America owes so much  used to speak of the ""mystique of urgency"" that we must regain. Today I pay tribute to his memory. The social problems are urgent  and we must press the international organizations to provide funds accordingly and  in this regard  to demonstrate flexibility in keeping with each country's stage of development. We are convinced that international trade  conducted in a transparent  non-discriminatory manner and on equitable terms  will be an important force in the revitalization of the world economy and will therefore be important to the developing countries. It is paradoxical and serious that the countries that are the greatest advocates of the elimination of trade barriers maintain  and even create new types of  protectionism and discrimination that make it difficult for the products of developing countries to gain access to their markets. This applies at present  for example  to bananas. And all this is taking place in the interdependent world that I mentioned at the beginning of my statement. In 1962 or 1963  as the representative of the Inter-American Development Bank  I spoke here about social questions. I believe that once again the United Nations must give these questions urgent attention. Economic development is important only insofar as it meets human needs. It is time all great social problems were better understood so that the United Nations might draw up an international programme of action to serve as the basis for the conference on social questions that it has been decided to convene.  Preservation of the environment  which is linked inextricably to sustainable development  is of enormous importance because of its national and international impact. The Stockholm Declaration of 1972 represented the first international step towards the establishment of basic universal principles for the protection of the world's environment. Since 1972 significant efforts have been made to stop pollution of land  seas and air and to prevent desertification and deforestation and other types of ecological damage. However  the constraints of reality made new initiatives necessary  and these culminated in the Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 a landmark event whose basic aim was to achieve agreement on certain programmes aimed at arresting the steady deterioration of the environment. Let us hope that the outcome of that Conference will be generally beneficial and will help to guarantee the future development and well-being of mankind. My Government is ready to take action to improve the environment of its own country and to contribute to universal efforts to preserve nature. But I must emphasize that although the developed countries  which are mainly responsible for the deterioration of the environment  have a particular obligation  it is other countries that are being asked to make the sacrifice of restricting the exercise of their legitimate right to use the wealth that nature has given them. It is necessary to seek due compensation jointly  especially in the shape of financial aid and technological cooperation. Ecuador  having become a transit country and an operational bridgehead for the drug trade  understands that drug trafficking  money laundering and related crimes are particularly harmful to young people  threaten democracy  produce an unnatural economy and  above all  damage the moral values of nations. We condemn drug trafficking in all its forms  and  while we do what we can to combat it  responsibility must be shared by the producer countries and the consumer countries. Thus we support the timely initiative of the President of Colombia  who  from this rostrum  suggested that a United Nations conference on illicit drugs be planned and convened with all the urgency that this matter demands. Unresolved economic and social  as well as humanitarian and ecological  problems of overriding importance continue to be a source of instability  and they carry the seeds of damage to international relations and even of conflict.  For those reasons  the Council requested the Secretary-General to prepare a special report  appropriately titled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). As a fresh contribution to previous efforts within the United Nations  whether to strengthen international security  promote good-neighbourly relations between States or to further the use of procedures to ensure he peaceful settlement of disputes  and with the constant aim of maintaining peace  this new Agenda introduced by the Secretary-General has some creative aspects and offers innovate alternatives for States to consider notably  the one he has so aptly termed ""preventive diplomacy"". As the well-known popular saying goes  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. My country  which is profoundly peace-loving by vocation and abides by the international principles of peaceful coexistence  supports this felicitous initiative by the Secretary-General  which will surely alert the nations to new opportunities for understanding and valid options for settling their disputes. Peace is not a blessing bestowed on us through the simple desire to live together peaceably: the need to cooperate in good faith while respecting the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter is also important. Peace is the result of a universal awareness that it is only by making a genuine contribution to the common weal  to the law of States  and with growing activities in solidarity and with international justice and equity that peace can grow and establish itself. Only in this way will peace be an integral part of the harmonious development of our peoples and of their security. A few weeks after my Government's inauguration  I came to this forum  the General Assembly  to make known not only my country's general ideas about the  world situation but also the principles which it has traditionally applied and will continue to apply in its international policy and  at the same time  to reiterate Ecuador's determination to contribute  as resolutely and wholeheartedly as possible  to the establishment of a permanent and constructive peace among all people. The people of Ecuador loves peace and believes in justice. My Government earnestly desires to maintain friendly relations with all countries and most of all with its neighbours; this is  of course  the natural result of Ecuador's deep-seated feelings  which  historically speaking  been expressed since the birth of the Republic  and are part of its character. Ecuador  as representatives in this General Assembly will already be well aware  is sincerely determined to solve its territorial problem with Peru. The beginning of dialogue between the two countries' Heads of State was a major step forward in this quest: it overcame the political taboo that had prevented Ecuadorians and Peruvians from discussing this situation in cordial  frank and constructive terms  without ignoring legitimate national interests and studying the obvious opportunities for joint development. It is my pleasure to inform this world forum that I am determined that the handling of the territorial problem with Peru - which  for so many years past has been a source of mistrust  concern and even discord between our two countries will be directed towards transforming the mutual suspicions of the past on the basis of justice and realism  in cooperation and with our efforts dedicated to the development of our impoverished peoples.  Our two countries  so alike on many counts  can and  above all  must find a just  honourable and realistic solution to the territorial dispute  which will mean a real process of economic integration. That is why  on the very day my Government took office  I said  in the presence of President Alberto Fujimori  that Ecuador would steadfastly continue to speak clearly and frankly  in an atmosphere of harmony and mutual respect with the help of the four countries which have historically been most closely associated with Ecuador and Peru on this matter over the last 50 years  and with the eminent participation of His Holiness John Paul II  in order to reach a permanent solution to this territorial dispute as soon as possible. This will enable Ecuador and Peru to extend a hand of friendship from the Pacific to the Amazon  which was discovered by an expedition that set out from Quito. In fact  Argentina  Brazil  Chile and the United States of America have been cognizant of the territorial crisis besetting Ecuador and Peru and have been witnesses in good standing of the hard times of sacrifice and suffering for my country; they know the history of the formation of our Republics  the misfortunes of their independence and of the subsequent years. They know about the origins and the epics of our peoples  about our rights and the events that have gone to weave the pattern of our history. For all those reasons  in a most special way  these four sister countries are destined to contribute to the search for just and creative initiatives to encourage Ecuador and Peru to overcome this territorial problem once and for all in short  to enable' them  with vision and courage  to write their common history. What can I say about the invaluable aid and assistance that His Holiness the Pope has given many countries  guided always by his vocation for peace and understanding between governments and peoples  particularly those of deep Christian faith? With his enlightened thought  as set out in the encyclical ""Centesimus Annus""  he has exhorted us to take specific steps to establish or consolidate international structures designed to seek peaceful solutions  and has reminded us that arbitration is an appropriate method of resolving conflicts which would otherwise keep nations unnecessarily estranged. That is why my predecessor  President Rodrigo Borja  quite rightly suggested  from this very rostrum  that His Holiness the Pope should offer his most valuable assistance  which would without a doubt be of great significance. In different terms and in another context  the President of Peru  during his official visit to Ecuador in January 1992  also stressed the singular importance of His Holiness's cooperation. In my inaugural message to my Government on 10 August last  I acknowledged that our views on these matters might differ from those of the Government and President of Peru; but that is precisely why it is important for there to be a frank and sincere dialogue between our Governments and peoples which dialogue would be the more significant for the fraternal aid of the four countries and the succour and assistance of the successor of Saint Peter. In conclusion  my Government and country are more convinced than ever of the immense contribution being made by the United Nations in the various fields of vital importance for humankind. I am personally honoured to recall that my father was the first Ambassador of the Republic of Ecuador to this Organization when it was taking its first steps in San Francisco. The Government of my country trusts that the noble objectives of peace and mutual understanding between all nations near and far  which have come notably to the fore in recent times  will eventually bring us good results which will make it possible for the world to enter the twenty-first century renewed and with its international relations restructured under the seal of law  justice and sustainable development for all peoples. I am quite sure that this General Assembly  by resolutely serving these interests  will bring us noticeably closer to the goal we all wish so much to reach. Let us embark upon this new path. "
"49",2140,"EGY",47,1992,"At the outset  I wish to convey the Egyptian Government's congratulations to the Presidency of Bulgaria on the election to the presidency of the General Assembly of Mr. Ganev and his assumption of that high post. I should like also to put on record our appreciation of the capable manner in which Mr. Samir Shihabi  the permanent representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  conducted the work of the Assembly at its last session. In addition  I want to congratulate the States that have recently joined the United Nations. I hope that they will participate effectively and constructively in the activities of the Organization and in defence of the purposes and principles of its Charter. This session  like past sessions and those that will follow in the 1990s  is of great importance. It is being held at a stage of evolution and change characterized by unprecedented dynamism and speed. It is a transitional stage in the course of which new patterns of international relations are being moulded. Hence  what the current session of the General Assembly is witnessing is not a stable international situation but  rather  a phase in a continuing process of evolution and change. Consequently  it is difficult to predict with any certainty what the years and decades to come may hold for the future of the world and its order. This uninterrupted process of change  however  requires the reaffirmation of certain matters which  in our view  constitute the basics which should determine the image of the future. The process of change should have a human content. No progress or civilization could have a point of departure other than respect for man  his rights  freedoms and dignity without discrimination because of colour  creed or religion. Only in a context of respect for peoples' rights  cultures and achievements and for their right to have their just demands met can there be any change or progress. International cooperation and interdependence based on justice and fairness constitute the basis for salubrious change and for positive movement towards any breakthrough of the future. In the context of the existing challenges  international peace and security are the collective responsibility of North and South  which should shoulder their burdens and obligations and  thereafter  share the dividends of success. Undoubtedly  the ever-increasing role of the Security Council necessitates a review of its membership and the scope of its responsibility  so that it may be a genuine reflection of international and regional forces. In their new concept  international relations should be integral in substance  rational in content and democratic in context. Therefore  the formulation of those relations requires collective participation if they are to reflect the interests of the international community  with all its components  and of the balance between rights and duties and between power and responsibility. International relations  in their current state of evolution  reflect a greater awareness and wider recognition of the relationship between future and destiny. Similarly  they reflect constant movement towards realism in dealing with inherited and nascent dilemmas. Nevertheless  they have been unable to remove elements of suspicion and feelings of frustration. Rather  they have helped to exacerbate such feelings in many places and about many issues  especially in the third world. While the seeds of change indicate a relaxation of global military confrontations  at the same time  they have crystallized the inherited sediments of regional and ethnic tensions and have transformed the equation of rivalry between East and West into an equation between North and South that has not taken final shape yet as it has not dealt  and does not seem to be going to deal  rationally  with the massive historic imbalances between regions of affluence and regions of scarcity  between regions of progress and those of backwardness. Indeed  there is genuine concern that unless it takes place under agreed controls  the ongoing process of change  will lead to the codification of these imbalances and  thereby  make them a feature of the new world order  with all that that would entail in terms of turmoil and chaos. These features of today's world  and portents of tomorrow's world  give rise to very real fears regarding the dominance of injustice and inequality in international relations on the political  security  economic and social levels. After this foreword  which reflects the feelings of the third world  Egypt's delegation would like to discuss four issues: the state of affairs in the United Nations; the situation in the third world; disarmament; and peace efforts in the Middle East  Africa  Asia and Europe. It is highly important that the purposes of the Charter be made the foundation of the new era  so that justice may be ensured  social progress promoted and better standards of living achieved in greater freedom as expressed by the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Peace. In our view  this is the real core of positive development and of any world order that strives for stability and peace. The purposes of the Charter  however  cannot be realized  and the strong desire to ensure justice and to promote social and economic progress cannot be fulfilled  in an age in which acute racialist trends rear their heads anew  in which dangers threaten the lives of whole communities  and in which there are signs of a return to foreign intervention in the affairs of States and of peoples. Hence  foremost among the main goals highlighted by the Secretary-General in his plan is action to deal  in a wider context  with the deepest causes of tension economic deprivation and social injustice. Dealing with these banes should be the cornerstone of the new world era. In this connection  I should like to voice our strong support for a statement made by the Secretary-General a statement that seems to have commanded insufficient consideration and appreciation. The Secretary-General said: ""It is noticeable that there is a common moral concept which is increasingly emerging and spreading among the world's peoples and nations. It is reflected in international laws  most of which have emerged through efforts made by the United Nations."" This statement deals with an issue on which  in our view  we should reflect  for we are in real need of a common moral concept. For many decades  the world has been plagued by policies of racial discrimination. Now is the time  the opportunity  to rid ourselves of those policies. Unfortunately  however  other racial conflicts have erupted  and there have been calls for ethnic purity. This shows that the world still lacks a common moral concept and the means of developing it in a rational and sound way. Such a concept should be based on consensus among our various societies  and it should be developed within the framework of our political experience since the Second World War. It should also be based on an analysis of all that has been achieved and all that has not been achieved  with a view to assessing the role played by.existing human-rights instruments and deciding whether to develop such instruments further or to replace them with new ones. We need a new world social contract between various world communities  cultures and civilizations. This new social contract should be based not on one model  no matter how successful such a model may have proved to be  but on rules upon which there is common agreement and which take into consideration the intrinsic characteristics of various societies  with a view to devising the best framework for the achievement of unity through diversity. In this way  we would define ""respect for human rights"" with reference to a concept shared and approved by all a concept that all would contract to implement. The new world social contract for which we call a contract linking parties from different civilizations and cultures should be constructed within the framework of the new era in which neither globalism and nationalism nor commonality and individuality should be regarded as opposing trends  but should be discussed from the point of view of peaceful evolution  equilibrium and respect for the purposes of the Charter. I strongly believe that calling for a new social contract is linked organically with the preventive diplomacy  participation in peacemaking and contribution to peace-keeping called for in the Agenda for Peace. The vision that the Secretary-General has put forth last June in his Agenda for Peace reflects hope as much as it reflects challenges. This vision embodies a call for the development of the role of the United Nations from one of mere crisis management and conflict resolution to a more comprehensive one which would embrace social  economic and humanitarian issues. It is a vision that presents newly developed dimensions imposed by the nature of the profound changes now taking place in the patterns of international relations. There should be a comprehensive and in-depth debate on this report and on the quintessence of this vision of the future. This debate should take place in the General Assembly and the Security Council  as well as in the various bodies of the United Nations  side by side with intensive examination in many other forums. It should involve research institutes in various States and continents  and should be aimed at reaching an acceptable formula to meet the political  security  economic and social requirements of the next stage in the history of the world. This Agenda for Peace keeps hope alive and sets concrete goals. It is characterized by the fact that it does not ignore or overlook the realities of the situation. It strikes a balance between the possible and the desirable  and it constitutes a prelude to the major aim of adapting the existing instruments to the new realities. The international community  which accepts even calls for - greater responsibility in the resolution of global and regional conflicts  also calls for an effective role for the United Nations in preventing wars and making peace. Respect for the United Nations involves  by definition  respect for its resolutions and the mobilization of its collective will to implement those resolutions with a view to imposing peace  if necessary  or negotiating peace if intentions are genuine and the parties concerned cooperate.  In the midst of all this  we find the problems nay  problem of the third world which is one of the most important issues we have to discuss in this forum that brings together all the peoples and nations of the world. In recent weeks the third world has convened a summit meeting in Indonesia  in the framework of the Non-Aligned Movement. President Soeharto addressed the Assembly in detail  yesterday  on the meeting  in his capacity as head of the Non-Aligned Movement. Today  I wish to dwell on a few points: first  the new world order should be based on solid foundations of law and on the principles of the Charter  as well as on an equitable sharing of responsibility and a joint commitment to cooperation and solidarity; secondly  the structure of that order should be dedicated to peace and justice  security and development and democracy at the domestic national levels  and in international relations  as well as to the promotion of the fundamental rights and freedoms of individual human beings and peoples;  thirdly  respect for sovereignty and adherence to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States as a principle that should not be impaired or diminished; fourthly  settlement of disputes by peaceful means and through continued dialogue and negotiation; fifthly  peace and stability are contingent on social and economic factors as much as they are contingent on political and military factors. Therefore  the diminishing prospects of economic development and social progress result in a serious threat to stability  and hence  to peace; sixthly  support for holding a world summit on social development that would put people and their social needs at the forefront of international efforts  and provide an opportunity to deal with the multi-faceted dimensions of social issues; seventhly  the United Nations  as the world embodiment of multilateralism  has a unique opportunity to be the international collective instrument for establishing a new world order based on justice and equality. Herein lies the link between the Agenda for Peace and the hopes and aspirations of the third world for a positive role through which it would contribute to building the new world order. We believe that the establishment of this order cannot and should not be realized through imposition or coercion  but rather through a democratic process in which all peoples and States of the world would have a role and a say. This can be achieved only through this Organization: the United Nations. In today's world  there exists a great tide towards disarmament and tangible progress towards agreement on its mechanisms and the achievement of its aims which  for long  have been sought by developed and developing nations alike. Third world States  represented by the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77  have made abundantly clear their determination to give priority to disarmament issues  particularly nuclear disarmament  and the rechannelling of released resources to the areas of development and to the achievement of socio-economic progress. Today  at this very same session  the new world is trying to take yet another step in that direction by introducing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. Egypt  which was one of the first States that participated in drafting this Convention and which called for the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction  should like to present to the General Assembly our regional view of this Convention. First  we are in favour of moving towards chemical-weapons disarmament in the framework of an international Convention that would constitute a part of an evolving and comprehensive process of disarmament towards general and complete disarmament  particularly of weapons of mass destruction; Secondly  we agree with the framework and content of the Convention as presented by the Conference on Disarmament; Thirdly  however  from our regional perspective  we consider that this Convention should not be dealt with in isolation from other efforts related to other weapons of mass destruction  mainly the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the international system of safeguards and inspection  and the provision of credible international guarantees; Fourthly  we have a declared initiative regarding the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East  including nuclear  chemical and biological weapons and other delivery systems. Therefore  our view of the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons comes within this overall framework and is an integral part of it;  Fifthly  Middle East Arab and non-Arab States  with the exception of one  have joined the international system of inspection or the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Thus their support for the disarmament process is evident. However  the existing exception of one State gives rise to many security concerns  particularly as we know that this exception enables one State in the Middle East to possess nuclear weapons without any international restrictions. It also enables this State  which possesses a massive arsenal of military industries  to be engaged in a process of missile development in a manner that makes it an enshrined exception in the framework of the disarmament process. This greatly negates the effectiveness of all disarmament operational instruments and threatens the whole concept of regional and even international disarmament. It also restricts the freedom of the region's States in acceding to the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons; Sixthly  against this backdrop  the ministerial meeting of the League of Arab States conducted an in-depth discussion of this issue in mid-September. The meeting approved the following points as a basis for the Arab position towards the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons: full willingness to deal with all disarmament proposals that would provide security through equal obligations applicable by one standard to all the States of the region; reaffirmation of full support for the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East  including nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  as the best way to achieve security for all the States of the region; and willingness to deal with the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and the framework of efforts aiming at the establishment of the zone to the extent that the excepted State  namely Israel  would respond to international calls to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to subject its nuclear facilities to the international safeguards system. That is our position towards the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. It is a position of support  but within the framework of an integrated disarmament process at the regional level in order to maintain the security of the Middle East States that are threatened by the existence of nuclear weapons in their region without any international control or legal obligation. Still dealing with the Middle East region  I should like to say that the stage through which the region is passing now is characterized by many positive elements as well as negative ones. In connection with the Middle East problem and the Palestine question  negotiations are currently under way  bilaterally and multilaterally  within the framework of a peace process based on the land-for-peace formula  and on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  adopted in the framework of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. They clearly provide for inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war  and thus safeguard the sovereign rights and territorial integrity of all  through withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967; and for the right of each State in the region to live in peace within its internationally guaranteed borders  thus ensuring security for all  Israel and Arab States alike. In fact  the Government of Mr. Yitzhak Rabin has moved in the right direction  dissipating clouds of uncertainty and clearing the way for hope and optimism. A basis of credibility has thus been created for the negotiations. That credibility was about to be lost indefinitely because of the actions of the previous Israeli Government and the former Prime Minister's statement that his intention was to procrastinate for 10 years. However  it is not only the atmosphere of the negotiations that is important but also the content of those negotiations  particularly in view of the fact that the Arab parties  mainly Syria  have agreed to enter into comprehensive peace agreements with Israel  provided that the latter adheres to its obligations under the Charter  and international law as well as to the unanimous international resolutions that stipulate withdrawal to the international boundaries and the recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Egypt has set out in detail its integrated view of the components of a comprehensive peace based on the elements of security and justice in accordance with the following principles: First  that the Arab-Israeli conflict in its entirety has four components: land  Palestinian rights  security for all  and regional cooperation in the framework of peace; Secondly  the need to implement the Security Council resolutions which represent the acceptable terms of reference for a negotiating process based on the formula of land for peace; Thirdly  the special status of Al-Quds city does not prejudice the fact that East Jerusalem is a part of the territories occupied since mid-1967. The principles of any settlement are as applicable to it as they are to any other part of the occupied territories. Its future is not to be foreclosed nor decided upon unilaterally. Consequently  it represents an area of the peace negotiations  whether in the interim stage or in the final stage  of a Palestinian-Israeli settlement; Fourthly  a settlement should be comprehensive for all fronts  including the Golan  Gaza and the West Bank  the Jordanian territories and South Lebanon  under Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  and the behests of international legality. Fifthly  interim arrangements in the context of the talks on full autonomy should be made without prejudice to the right of the Palestinian peoples to decide their own future and the exercise of their right to self determination; Sixthly  the problem of the post-1948 war Palestinian refugees and the persons displaced after the 1967 war should be dealt with in conformity with resolutions based on international law and consensus based on good faith. The Egyptian view of a future Middle East within the context of new international relations  as well as the context of cultural affinity and the historical ties that bind all Arab States  together with Egypt's peaceful relations with Israel  enable Egypt to play an active role in the peace process and to provide some support for the negotiations to fulfill the legitimate demands called for under Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the land-for-peace formula. So much for the problem of the Middle East and Palestine. As for the Gulf region  which is part of the Middle East  we witness new tensions caused by Iran's occupation of Arab islands  the latest of which was Abu-Moussa. This is a development we can neither overlook nor ignore. We therefore call upon Iran to reconsider its position on this issue  to adhere to the principles of good- neighbourliness  to respect the norms of international law and the sovereignty of States over their territories and to restore the situation to the status quo ante. We hope that the course of relations between Iran and the Arab peoples will be one of friendship  brotherhood and cooperation. These peoples have much in common to make them more united than otherwise. Amidst these omens for the region  we in Egypt are concerned about the fate of all segments of the the Iraqi people and all parts of its land. Therefore  while we call upon the Iraqi Government to abide by the rules and decisions of international legality  we call upon the international community to safeguard Iraq's territorial integrity and the unity of its people. In the same way  we support Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its international borders.  As we discuss the major issues facing the world of today  I cannot but refer to the situation in Africa. The African continent  and particularly in the Horn of Africa  faces a range of political  economic and social problems. The situation cries out for increased attention to be paid to the continent on the part of the international community. In the meantime  the democratic changes in the continent and its States' awareness of the need for continental and regional cooperation gives us confidence that Africa has the capability to rise to the challenge. I therefore urge the international community to shoulder its responsibilities towards implementing the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa in the 1990s in order to accelerate the transition to democracy and the economic and social development in the countries of the continent. At the same time  progress in the process of eliminating apartheid is a positive aspect amidst such drawbacks. It should not be hampered by the attempts of racial extremists. The people of South Africa are on their way to exercising their legitimate rights. Incidents of violence or apostasy must not stop the positive evolution. Our responsibility is to support the process of dialogue and negotiations in order to restore the momentum needed for achieving a democratic non-racial society in South Africa. Last but not least  the situation in Somalia requires more than the mere humanitarian assistance to which we all contribute. What we need is to intensify efforts to achieve national reconciliation. While we call on the international community to continue its efforts in the humanitarian field  we call upon the Somali parties to rise to the responsibility of forging sound relations between them and discarding the tribal rivalries and power struggles which show a lack of national awareness. By the same token  we stand firmly against aggression and in defence of respecting the sovereignty and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and are committed to stopping attempts at interference in its internal affairs  as well as the practices of ""ethnic cleansing"" committed against its people  which reflect an attitude of inherited racial bigotry  intellectual backwardness and cultural regression. The demise of Yugoslavia  though regrettable in view of its past contributions to international life  makes it incumbent upon us to work for the respect of equal rights for all its peoples and all the States that have emanated from it  as all of them  not only one  are its successors in the world order. A view that has already been adopted by the General Assembly. These are the issues that are of concern to us in Europe  Africa and Asia. We are at the threshold of a world which looks forward to stability  but is in a transitional period in the course of which the map of tomorrow may be redrawn. Chaos may erupt and States  ethnic groupings  and terrorists may resort to force to an attempt to halt the march of history  civilization and progress. But the collective will shall open the doors to the United Nations and  thereby  will allow us to opt for a better tomorrow of unhampered economic development and social interdependence wherein we shall protect the environment  guided by the principles and obligations of the Rio de Janeiro summit meeting; a better tomorrow of respect for human rights; a better tomorrow that all of us will participate in bringing about for the sake of the world we aspire after in the twenty-first century. "
"50",2210,"ESP",47,1992,"Allow me first of all to convey to you. Sir  my most sincere congratulations  on my own behalf and that of my delegation  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I wish you every success in the execution of your tasks during the coming months. I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia. I should like to give a warm welcome to all those countries that have joined the Organization this year  and I hope that their active participation in this forum will contribute to the efforts of the international community to preserve peace and promote justice and progress among nations. With the admissions of Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan  the Organization's goal of universality has been promoted. I should also like to convey to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali the respect of the Spanish Government for his efforts and dedication in carrying out the important responsibilities with which he is entrusted. You may rest assured  Mr. Secretary-General  that you can count on the full collaboration of the Spanish authorities. During the general debate at the forty-sixth session  the common denominator of many statements heard in the General Assembly was the tremendous changes that had taken place in the world since the middle of the previous decade. Far from abating  the pace of that trend to transformation has significantly accelerate over the last 12 months. At this stage of the process  it would be no exaggeration to say that we have before us a new pattern of international relations. After the disappearance of the East-West confrontation and its replacement by dialogue and cooperation  decisive progress has been made in disarmament agreements and arms control  at both world-wide and regional levels. Long-festering regional conflicts have been settled or may well be on their way towards settlement. To the progress made along the road to peace in Angola and Cambodia we must add the process begun last year in Madrid with the opening of the Middle East peace conference  which constituted an invaluable point of departure for the solution of the Palestinian problem and for achieving the necessary and definitive harmonious relations between Arabs and Israelis. Likewise  the current peace plan for Western Sahara should culminate soon in the holding of a referendum on self-determination under the auspices of the United Nations. I also wish to stress the progress made in the eradication of the policy of apartheid in South Africa. We fully support the efforts of the Secretary-General to put an end to violence and to encourage the resumption of the internal negotiations that must lead to the total eradication of apartheid and to the establishment of a truly democratic regime in South Africa. Similarly  the Peace Agreement signed in Chapultepec  on 16 January of this year  between the Government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front constitutes a milestone of paramount importance for the peace process in Central America  a region that has been in a constant state of conflict for the past decade. Spain  which has so many links to that region  has been and is still actively collaborating in that process through its participation in the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General for peace in El Salvador.. In that connection  Spain welcomes the exemplary manner in which the Governments of El Salvador and Honduras have settled their territorial  insular and maritime disputes. The map of Europe has undergone a profound transformation over the past year. The unification of Germany now appears fully consolidated. Russia and the formerly subjugated countries that recovered their independence and freedom are struggling to consolidate their democracies and to overcome the serious economic difficulties brought on by their transition to a market economy. The European Community  on its way towards union  is acquiring a greater political role  in accordance with its undoubted economic strength. Democratic ideals and practices and the recognition of human rights have reappeared vigorously not only in Eastern Europe but also in Latin America and many African countries  despite the grave economic situation now prevailing on that continent. Those auspicious events should not lead us to forget that the collapse of the former system has opened up a great void fraught with risks in which disorder may find a natural home. In some extreme cases  we are witnessing the exacerbation of previously repressed or latent nationalist forces which are giving rise to such bloody conflicts as those at present dividing the new Caucasian Republics and the new States that emerged after the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia. Such situations reveal that the horrors of the past can always be repeated if we do not keep looking to the future. This is something that neither Europe nor the rest of the international community can or should allow. The seriousness of the conflict now taking place in the territory of the former Yugoslavia is a good example of what I have just said. In the Conference that started in London  the many efforts of the international community converged in an attempt to put an end to that complex conflict by helping the parties to resolve their differences through the negotiations currently taking place in Geneva. Aggression  the use of force  and the violation of human rights will only generate destruction and hatred and will meet with the continued condemnation and determined action of the international community to put an end to them.  Meanwhile  the gap between the developed and the developing countries persists and  in many cases  has even widened. Old conflicts have intensified and new ones have appeared. The tragedy presently afflicting Somalia is palpable proof of the terrible effects that underdevelopment  poverty  natural disasters and violence can have when they coincide in time and place. This situation demands greater solidarity and a swift collective response such as the one decided in the framework of the United Nations  which was aimed at putting an end to such terrible suffering and making possible a peace process that will lead to national reconciliation in that country. For all these reasons  after the initial moments of surprise and euphoria  of perplexity and optimism in the face of what seemed to be the emergence of a new world order  we are now coping with the need to incorporate these new changes  so as jointly to build a more just and secure international society. This is the great task confronting the United Nations today. The choice is very clear: we cannot allow the Organization to trail behind events  letting itself be moulded by them. On the other hand  we can make the United Nations an active forum and the foremost centre in the transformations affecting us all  capable of influencing and shaping these transformations. This alternative  this leading role  which is the one desired by Spain for the United Nations  is the choice that seems to have been made by the Secretary-General when he drew up his excellent report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) ' and when he reported to the General Assembly on the work of the Organization. I referred earlier to changes in the international climate that have made it possible to defuse various deeply-rooted regional conflicts. The United  Nations has contributed to this objective to a large extent through the peacemaking activities of the Secretary-General carried out in the framework of the peace-keeping operations. The results obtained over recent years have made it possible to speak  truly  of a process of revitalization of the Organization. However  the present momentum behind this process has proven insufficient  as demonstrated by the persistence of some old conflicts and the outburst of new forms of violence. From this perspective  the Spanish Government believes that the set of suggestions put forward by Mr. Boutros-Ghali represents a very useful basis for a systematic and effective response by the Organization and the international community to any kind of conflict  whatever the causes and outcome. It is essential  to this end  to secure the cooperation of all Member States in the complex tasks ranging from conflict-prevention to the consolidation of peace. The increase and enhancement of peace-keeping operations requires a growing effort on the part of us all. Spain is aware of this and  after participating in a noteworthy manner in the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia and in the United Nations Observer Group in Central America (ONUCA)  is contributing with a large number of army and police officers to the work of the United Nations Operation in El Salvador (ONUSAL). Moreover  Spain is participating actively in the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) and is collaborating with the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). Spain is also prepared to participate with a military contingent in the task of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finally  Spain provides aid - mainly humanitarian within the framework of other operations established by the Security Council. The peace-keeping operations have also undergone a qualitative change  as new and different activities have been undertaken that go beyond their traditional limits. These new dimensions require special training and a rapid response that can hardly be obtained if we do not follow the Secretary-General's suggestion of establishing special national units ready to be rapidly deployed at the service of the Organization. Spain is prepared to consider this proposal seriously after appropriate consultations with the other Member States and with the Secretary-General. Nevertheless  we must bear in mind that peace cannot be made and cannot be consolidated with the use of military means alone. It is necessary  whenever possible  to resolve conflicts before they degenerate into armed hostilities  using all the means for peaceful settlement of disputes provided for in the Charter. In this context  I would like to underline the Secretary-General's statement that greater confidence on the part of States in the International Court of Justice would contribute significantly to the Organization's task of peace-seeking. Spain has already given proof of this confidence by recently accepting the Court's compulsory jurisdiction and by supporting the possibility of authorizing the Secretary-General to request advisory opinions of the Court on legal questions arising within the scope of his activities. Spain has firmly supported the strengthening of the United Nations role in the field of preventive diplomacy. That is why we decided to co-sponsor the initiatives leading to the approval  in 1988  of the Declaration on conflict-prevention and  in 1991  of the Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field of the Maintenance of International Peace and Security. These efforts should be enhanced  and in this connection  such measures as fact-finding missions  an early-warning system and the reinforcement of the role of regional organizations can be very useful in preventing conflicts which  if allowed to start  might later require the launching of a much more costly exercise for the reestablishment of peace. In this sense  we also believe that all efforts that could contribute to the consolidation of peace once it has been reached  should be promoted in order to avoid the resurgence of new conflicts over the not yet extinguished flames of a pre-existent conflict. In this regard  I would like to underline here the considerable increase in the Organization's efforts in the field of humanitarian assistance  as well as the tasks recently carried out in the field of electoral assistance in countries where democracy and peaceful cohabitation are threatened or insufficiently established. The role of the Organization on behalf of refugees has also been of great importance for the consolidation of peace  as has its work in the field of disarmament and the promotion and defence of human rights. The Member States of the Organization must be aware that the new tasks that we are entrusting to the United Nations are increasing in number and complexity day by day  and are without precedent in its history. In order for the Organization to be prepared to meet these new demands for international action  the unconditional financial backing of each of its Members is required. This year  we have completed the drafting of the text of the Convention on chemical weapons  which envisages the prohibition of the development  stockpiling and use of these weapons  as well as their destruction. The elimination of this type of weapon is a long-sought objective that should now be attained. Spain decidedly supports the adoption of this Convention at this session of the General Assembly  and hopes that it will soon enter into force. We welcome the proposal of the Twelve  adopted by the General Assembly last year  to create in the Secretariat a Register of Conventional Arms with regard to the international transfer of such arms  which envisages the transmission of information by all Member States. It is necessary for all of us to cooperate  so that this Register may be established as the clearing-house for the exchange of information on all flows of conventional arms  and in the near future to include information on other types of weapons and other data concerning the military capacity of States. To the achievements of the Organization in the field of disarmament and arms control must be added this year other important progress made at regional and world-wide levels aimed at reinforcing the stability and security of our planet and thus the purposes of the United Nations. I am referring to the withdrawal of all tactical nuclear weapons  from areas where they were deployed until very recently  to the territories of the United States and the Russian Federation. We must underscore as well the agreements reached recently by President Bush and President Yeltsin on a drastic reduction of the nuclear arsenals in their respective countries. We also welcome the initiatives taken by several nuclear Powers to declare moratoriums on their nuclear tests  or to reduce them to a bare minimum. In the European region  one must underscore the significance of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and its complementary Act on personnel strength  both already in force  as well as the conclusion of the Open Skies Treaty and the adoption of a new series of confidence-building measures. Spain welcomes all these achievements and hopes that they will lead to further progress in this field. The ultimate beneficiary of the United Nations efforts to achieve a more peaceful  just and secure world is undoubtedly mankind as a whole. Thanks to a large extent to United Nations action we have made significant advances in the defence and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms internationally. However  we are living in a period of instability and uncertainty  in which not only economic inequalities but also the resurgence of intolerance  xenophobia and exacerbated nationalism  among other factors  are endangering personal freedom and security. That is why it is necessary to intensify our efforts in this area  so as to encourage understanding and respect for the rights of individual members of minorities and for the needs of the most vulnerable groups of society. In this respect  we consider particularly important that this Assembly approve by consensus  as the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council have recently done  the draft declaration on the rights of persons belonging to national  ethnic  religious or linguistic minorities. My country places great hopes on the World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for next year in Vienna. This Conference should  on the basis of existing universally accepted standards  draw the basic guidelines for our future activity in this field  so that individuals and peoples may  through democracy and development  fully enjoy the benefits of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The achievements of the United Nations in the field of international peace and security contrast with the limited progress in the sphere of economic and social development. The world gap between rich and poor has been widening in an alarming way. The United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report for 1992 shows that the richest 20 per cent of the world population receive 82.7 per cent of total world income  whereas the poorest 20 per cent receive only 1.4 per cent. The international community cannot remain passive in the face of these grave and growing disparities. The Organization  owing to its universal membership and the breadth of its purposes and principles  must play a leading role to guide and stimulate the establishment of guidelines for the United Nations system as a whole  in order to find solutions to the important issues related to the development and well-being of all peoples. It is necessary in this respect to strengthen the Economic and Social Council. Some progress has already been made in its restructuring  but it is necessary that such restructuring be continued and deepened in order to revitalize this principal organ of our Organization. It also seems necessary to envisage the reform of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in order to adapt it to the new realities  as was underscored at its eighth session  held in Cartagena de Indias last February. We support the establishment by the Assembly during its current session of a high-level Commission on Sustainable Development that was agreed to at the Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro last June  where the concept of sustainable development was identified as a central element that should inspire the theory and practice of development policies in the coming years. We should look for new ways of dealing with the main task of attaining sustainable development and assign greater financial resources to this task  in particular by those countries that are in a position to do so. My country is aware of the fact that it must make an effort in proportion to its economic capacity. For this reason  the President of the Spanish Government at the summit meeting at Rio de Janeiro  after recalling that Spain had tripled its official aid over the past 10 years  made a commitment to triple its aid again in the course of the coming decade. This is a difficult challenge that we have taken upon ourselves but one that we are ready to fulfil. The world population has more than doubled over the past 40 years  and according to recent estimates it will double again in the next 30 years. This astounding growth demands a serious analysis on the part of the international community as well as a careful study of the consequences that it generates  such as migratory flows  the problems of large urban concentrations and the enormous demands it creates in the areas of food  housing  health care and education. These are all issues that should be studied in depth at the Conference on Population and Development  to be held in Cairo in 1994. It is not surprising that social problems are gaining importance at the present time  when many economies are undergoing tough processes of adjustment and others are going through difficult transitions from a central planning system to one of market economy. The summit conference on social development to be held in 1995 is therefore a timely initiative. Proper preparation is the best guarantee for its success. The basic guiding principle for its work should be the concept of human development; it should examine the necessary measures to provide greater opportunities for education  medical care and employment to the world's inhabitants. It is becoming daily more obvious that economic growth in itself does not automatically improve people's living conditions  neither within nations nor internationally. Therefore  it is essential to give a social dimension to the concept of economic development. Allow me to refer now to two great threats to society today: drug trafficking and terrorism. The drug-trafficking business is so grim and complex and has so many ramifications that efforts to combat it must be based on the strengthening of national measures and on effective international coordination and cooperation. The producer countries must receive the assistance needed to grow alternative crops and to enable them to confront the powerful and well-armed drug-trafficking organizations. Those countries producing substances likely to be used in the manufacture of drugs should inspect and control the exports of those substances. Consuming countries also responsible for the drug-trafficking must strengthen programmes and measures aimed at decreasing domestic demand. Moreover  perseverance is necessary in inspecting bank accounts used by drug traffickers and in reporting money-laundering when suspicions of its connection with this illegal activity exist. Concealing information on the drug-trafficking business amounts to complicity in criminal activity. Terrorism  for its part  continues to pose a threat to human life and to coexistence between nations. It is a threat of an international character and as such requires international efforts for its eradication. General Assembly resolution 46/51  adopted by consensus last year  was a further step in United Nations work aimed at developing greater international cooperation for this purpose. Those two threats  especially that of terrorism  are interrelated with illegal arms dealing  which must be combated just as firmly by the international community. There is one issue whose importance for Spain is well known: the decolonization of Gibraltar. I wish to restate my Government's determination to continue  with dedication and in a constructive spirit  the negotiating process with the United Kingdom established by the Brussels Declaration of 27 November 1984  bearing in mind the doctrine of the General Assembly that this is not a case of self-determination but a situation that affects the territorial integrity of Spain. I trust that the negotiating efforts of both Governments will soon lead to a definitive solution that  while taking into account the legitimate interests of the people  will put an end to the colonial status of Gibraltar a status that is clearly anachronistic and inappropriate to the times in which we live  especially since the General Assembly's proclamation of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism until the year 2000. Last July  in Madrid  the Heads of State and Government participating in the Second Ibero-American Summit adopted a document of conclusions reaffirming their aspirations to a free  open and pluralistic society directed towards progress and social justice  a society in which free rein is given to the full exercise of individual freedoms and in which no one is excluded or persecuted. I am certain that this is an ideal we all share. The Ibero-American Summit declared itself in favour of reforming the United Nations system and stressed the need to give it momentum so that it could respond more efficiently to the will of all its Member States. The celebration  in 1995  of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will be a good occasion for the attainment of this objective  which will enable the General Assembly to undergo renewal and revitalization  following on that already experienced by the Security Council. The Organization would then more faithfully reflect the important changes that have taken place in international society during the last 50 years. We are all well aware that in today's world no nation can stand on its own. The fate of each and every one of our countries is linked to the fate of the others. I wish therefore to conclude my statement by expressing the firm conviction that in the new global and integrated society that is emerging at the end of this century no intelligent action can be taken that is not based on the exercise of the most resolute solidarity.

"51",2236,"EST",47,1992,"Let me first convey to Mr. Ganev my congratulations on his election as President of this session. His election is a fitting tribute to his personal and professional qualities  and to his country  Bulgaria  which is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. We wish him success in accomplishing his tasks  and we pledge to him our support and cooperation. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General  Ambassador Boutros Boutros-Ghali  especially for his efforts to help find peaceful solutions to conflicts throughout the world. We wish him success and will support him in every way possible in his pursuit of implementing the objectives and principles of the United Nations. We congratulate and look forward to working with all of the States recently admitted to the United Nations. Today  Estonia's most vital task is to augment and secure our newly restored independence  including further development of our democratic institutions  our economy  our national security and our international relations. I will begin by addressing accusations made here last week regarding alleged human rights abuses in Estonia by Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. It is incomprehensible to us that Mr. Kozyrev maintains that foreign citizens should be allowed to vote in Estonian parliamentary elections. Mr. Kozyrev's suggestions that minorities in some countries should be placed under United Nations trusteeship puzzles us  since Article 78 of the same Charter of the United Nations to which he referred states: ""The trusteeship system shall not apply to ... Members of the United Nations  relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality."" It should be further noted that  according to United Nations documents  the term ""minority"" does not apply to foreign nationals  migrant workers and colonists. I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that Estonia has invited a mission from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw to investigate any and all allegations of human rights violations in Estonia. I invite the Russian Federation likewise to invite a similar mission to visit and review Russia's recent human rights record  especially with respect to minority rights. During the year since independence was restored  Estonia has made every effort to create a State based on equal justice for all. On 21 October 1991  Estonia acceded to fundamental international agreements protecting human rights  including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights. Estonia has embarked on the long and arduous process of updating legislation inherited from the Soviet occupation  bringing its laws into compliance with international human rights norms. In a referendum held on 28 June 1992 Estonian citizens approved a new democratic Constitution. According to its Constitution  Estonia is a parliamentary republic that guarantees a division of powers and independent courts. Elections for a new Parliament and President the first free. democratic elections in more than 50 years were held nine days ago  on 20 September  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the new Constitution. All Estonian citizens  defined by the 1938 pre-Soviet occupation Law on Citizenship and additional legislation that expanded enfranchisement  were entitled to vote. These laws also provide a legal basis for those people who settled in Estonia as a result of Soviet occupation to apply for Estonian citizenship by naturalization  if they so desire.* Numerous international experts have concluded that Estonia's citizenship law is among the most liberal in the world. Estonia has historically acted as a bridge between Western Europe and Russia. Relations of good-neighbourliness with Russia  in which both parties respect the other's sovereignty and laws  and strictly adhere to principles regarding the inviolability of State borders and non-interference in the internal affairs of another State  will allow Estonia to continue its intermediary role to the mutual benefit of both States. The realization of this mediatory role has been complicated by differences between Estonia's and Russia's interpretation of the legal status of the Republic of Estonia. Estonia considers itself to be the same State as the pre-Second World War Republic of Estonia  whose legal de jure continuity was not interrupted by German occupation or Soviet occupation and annexation. All consequences of this annexation are thus ex tunc not valid from their inception  a view that is shared by nearly all countries of the world. Several pre-war agreements concluded with States that recognize the legal continuity of Estonia have recently re-entered into force. Estonia also respects the principle of the legal continuity of citizenship. Because Russia is the self-styled successor State to the Soviet Union  Estonia considers citizens of the former Soviet Union who currently reside in Estonia as a result of Soviet occupation to be Russian citizens  unless they have become citizens of another country. Russia  however  believes that Estonia is a new State  created in 1991 as a result of the disintegration of the Soviet Union  although the disintegration of the Soviet Union occurred after the re-establishment of Estonia's independence. The development of Estonian-Russian relations must be viewed in the context of the development of democracy in both countries. The Estonian freedom movement had a positive influence on the democratization of Russia and other Central and Eastern European countries. Estonia's declaration of sovereignty on 16 November 1988 served as a practical example for other freedom movements. It is interesting to note that Russian democrats  including Boris Yeltsin  printed their newspapers in Estonia when printing such papers was forbidden in Russia  helping to spread democratic ideals in Russia. A treaty between Estonia and Russia in which both countries recognized the other as independent and sovereign States was signed on 12 January 1991. Estonia considers this treaty to be one of the cornerstones of Estonian-Russian relations  and places great value on the fact that Russia was one of the first States to recognize the restoration of Estonian independence. Unfortunately  there are Russian politicians who assert that Estonia should not be considered separate from Russia. They hold that Russia has historical and geopolitical claims to Estonian territory and that Estonia has no right to independence. There is a desire to preserve a Russian military presence in Estonia at any cost  and to bind Estonia to the Russian Federation through an international campaign which demands Estonian citizenship for Russian citizens while retaining Russia's right to be their guardian and protector. Having been a victim of the Soviet Union's imperialist policies for more than 50 years  Estonia has not only the right under international law  but also the moral obligation to demand that Russia withdraw its military forces and refrain from interfering in Estonia's internal affairs. The need for a withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Estonia is the primary stumbling block in bilateral relations between Estonia and the Russian Federation. While we acknowledge that the leadership of Russia now has a better appreciation of our demands than at the beginning of our negotiations  Estonia still calls for international support to accelerate the unconditional  early  orderly and complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from Estonian soil. We also appeal for the ex-Soviet military nuclear reactors in Estonia to be placed under international supervision. This is why we are presenting a draft resolution to the General Assembly on the withdrawal of foreign troops from the Baltic States. A similar resolution was adopted by the recently concluded Summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This reflects our belief that  although regional conflicts and disputes should be resolved on a regional basis  the United Nations should be ready to act preventively  and should express its opinion on matters which may potentially affect the security of a whole continent. None the less  I must emphasize that throughout history economic  cultural and scientific cooperation have played an important  positive role in Estonian-Russian relations  and Estonia sincerely hopes this cooperation will continue. The integration of both Estonia and Russia into a democratic Europe will also help ensure that our relations remain good-neighbourly in the long run. Estonians have strong historical  cultural and linguistic ties to the Nordic countries. These ties  which the Soviet system tried to sever  are now actively being restored. As an illustration of how quickly bilateral relations have changed for Estonia  I would mention that Finland recently surpassed the Commonwealth of Independent States as Estonia's number one trading partner. Estonia embarked on the path of economic reform towards a market economy at the same time as it launched its political battle for independence. As a country in transition  we have progressed to a situation in which the vestiges of the command economy have almost been eliminated and the first signs of a healthy market economy have appeared. The monetary reform carried out in Estonia on 20 June this year was an important step towards a market economy. The sole legal tender in Estonia is now the Estonian kroon. Monetary reform has helped establish conditions which are essential for the progress of privatization. Wide-scale privatization will eliminate a situation in which the State helps essentially bankrupt enterprises remain in business  and will instead promote the development of new private enterprises. With the close cooperation of international institutions  a great deal of work has been done to ensure that we accurately report and measure our economic performance through reliable statistics. For this reason  we are concerned about how our assessment rate here at the United Nations is calculated through the exclusive use of Soviet statistics. Estonian national accounts and foreign exchange statistics are being ignored. The use of current methodology means that our assessment is calculated on the basis of political rather than economic considerations. Both the Stockholm Initiative and the Secretary-General's report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) address the need to prevent conflicts before they arise. During the past year we have seen how difficult it is to solve conflicts once they escalate to war. Estonia considers preventive diplomacy to be of the utmost importance. The United Nations must have the collective will to become actively involved in the prevention of potential conflicts. This Organization carries the burden of history while facing a future full of hope and possibilities. Estonia is determined to perform its role in helping to create a new Europe and the new world of tomorrow. "
"52",2282,"ETH",47,1992,"On behalf of the Ethiopian delegation and myself I wish to extend heartfelt congratulations to you. Sir  on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. My delegation is confident that  under your wise guidance  the current session of the General Assembly will achieve outstanding successes. In this connection I wish to assure Your Excellency of my delegation's full co-operation in the discharge of your responsibilities. I also wish to express my delegation's sincere appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his able stewardship of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Likewise  I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  for his vigorous efforts to fulfil the mandate bestowed upon him by the world community. We are confident that under his able leadership the stature and credibility of the United Nations will be further enhanced. We wish him every success in his endeavours. My delegation is also pleased to extend a cordial welcome to all the new Members of the United Nations which have joined our family during the last 12 months. The end of the cold war  which was a great turning-point in history  was followed by further positive changes in the international political climate. However  it is a matter of concern to us that there are still conflicts raging in many parts of the world. The thaw in the relations between East and West did not necessarily lead to total peace  devoid of human suffering and hardship. In this regard  I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the unfolding tragedy in Somalia  which defies imagination and affronts our senses and sensibilities. Over the past two years  the situation in the country has deteriorated so much that the State has ceased to exist. Law and order  peace and stability and the basic infrastructure necessary for the life of a functioning society are virtually non-existent. These have all been destroyed by acts of internecine warfare  the extent of whose damage and the consequent human suffering combine to make Somalia one of the worst humanitarian crises in living memory. It is lamentable that Somalia should be bleeding to death by the actions of its own sons. Nearly half the total population of the country has been dislocated by war and famine. Scores of children and old people are dying every day  while thousands have perished. The Somali people have left their homes and fled to neighbouring and other countries. Given the situation in Somalia today  it is pertinent to ask why the various factions are doing all this to their own country and people. Why this wanton destruction for the sake of political power over a disintegrating country? How can one explain what is being done to the people of Somalia  something which goes beyond any conceivable political cause or justification when we see women  children and the elderly being killed indiscriminately merely because they belong to this clan or that sub-clan? This nightmare must come to an immediate end. The Ethiopian people can speak from their own history of 30 years of conflict: war and the application of brute force and senseless destruction cannot by any means provide the solution to a country's political problems. We believe that the bloodletting in Somalia during the past two years should serve as a sufficient lesson to the various factions that the path of conflict can only lead to more catastrophe. Historical knowledge confirms beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of force or war never achieved lasting results in the conduct of human affairs. It is our firm conviction that the protagonists in the current crisis in Somalia should make the welfare and interests of the country and the people they claim to represent uppermost in their minds. It must be stated that Somalia's neighbours  the countries of the Horn of Africa  did not spare the slightest effort to bring about a peaceful resolution of the tragic conflict. It will be recalled that a Horn of Africa summit meeting on humanitarian issues was convened in Addis Ababa  Ethiopia  in April 1992. Its main objective was to examine the serious humanitarian crisis in the subregion and work with regional organizations and the United Nations in order to save lives and ultimately bring the warring factions together with a view to seeking a solution to the fratricidal conflict. At the end of the summit meeting  a Declaration  Framework of Cooperation and Programme of Action was issued. This was followed by the Horn of Africa Conference on Humanitarian Issues  held to formulate modalities for the effective implementation of the summit Declaration. A resolution on the situation in Somalia was subsequently adopted which  inter alia  provided for a cease- fire among the warring factions  the holding of immediate peace talks leading to national reconciliation and lasting political settlement in the country  and the unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people in need. Most significantly  the summit meeting decided to establish a high-level Standing Committee of the Horn of Africa on Somalia to coordinate ongoing efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In fulfilment of its mandate  the Committee convened an all-party meeting on Somalia in Bahr-Dar  Ethiopia  in May 1992. At that meeting agreement was reached on the effective distribution of humanitarian assistance and on convening a national reconciliation conference. To follow up the implementation of these two agreements  the Chairman and other members of the Committee visited Somalia twice in May and August 1992 and held talks with leaders of various political organizations. The result of the mission has been generally satisfactory under the circumstances. The Committee is still actively seized of the crisis in Somalia in all its aspects. The effort of the countries of the Horn of Africa is a practical manifestation of the principle that regional conflicts should  as far as possible  be resolved by the countries of the area concerned. Although the situation in Somalia has for some time been ignored and left on the sidelines  it is encouraging to note that the United Nations and donor Governments are giving it the necessary attention it so rightly deserves. The international effort to distribute humanitarian assistance to those in need should be further intensified as a matter of top priority. The efforts under way by the Governments of the Horn of Africa  the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity  and others  to bring about lasting peace in Somalia should henceforth be pursued in a coordinated manner. We should all speak with one voice to the parties in the conflict. The message they should get should be one  and only one: that they cannot continue with their callous disregard for the interests and welfare of the people of Somalia; that the existence of Somalia as a nation should  first and foremost  be of paramount importance; that there is no way they can achieve their aims through war; and that they should be prepared to resolve their differences by peaceful means. In this connection  it is sad to note that certain quarters are undermining the peaceful resolution of the crisis by supplying weapons to the warring factions instead of relief assistance to the suffering people of Somalia  or dumping industrial toxic waste on Somali territory instead of providing medicine to take care of the sick and wounded  and plundering the livestock and marine resources of Somalia instead of providing critically needed humanitarian assistance. We call on these quarters to desist from attempts to polarize the region of the Horn of Africa and instead work with us in partnership in our efforts to restore lasting peace and stability in Somalia. I should like now to turn to another issue of concern to us. We have been following closely the positive developments in South Africa. However  we still have serious misgivings about the prospects for the peaceful transformation of that country  as the system of apartheid remains in place. We are deeply committed to the decisions and positions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the United Nations decisions and positions that have been emphasized repeatedly over the years as well as to the principled stand of the democratic forces in South Africa to end the apartheid system once and for all and set in motion an irreversible process of change to a multiracial and democratic political order in that country. The current efforts to create the conditions necessary for the success of peaceful negotiation should be encouraged. In this connection  the recent agreement between the African National Congress and the Government to resume negotiations is a positive development  as is the release of political prisoners. We look forward to the initiation of talks between all the democratic forces in South Africa and the Government  with a view to the establishment of an interim Government to supervise the process of preparing a constitutional order for a multiracial and democratic South Africa. Likewise  we are gravely concerned about the tragic situation in the former Yugoslavia  particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This crisis  which is fast getting out of control  is a serious threat to international peace and security. The continuing bloodshed should be brought to an end and a political solution acceptable to all parties should be found as soon as possible. In this respect  we hope that the conference currently being held in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations and the European Community will have concrete results. We are also following the current peace process in the Middle East. Despite the international community's repeated efforts to broker peace  the situation in the Middle East still hangs in the balance. Nevertheless  the prospects for peace in the area are better today than they have been for a long time. We are therefore hopeful that the question of Palestine  which is at the core of the Middle East problem  will eventually be resolved in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions so that a just  durable and comprehensive settlement for the region as a whole may be achieved. We are gratified by the outcome of the efforts of the Conference on Disarmament with regard to chemical weapons. The draft treaty prohibiting the production  use  transfer and stockpiling of chemical weapons represents an important step in the global effort to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. We derive special satisfaction from the success of nearly 25 years of effort in the disarmament process and from Ethiopia's contribution as a member of the Conference on Disarmament. In view of current trends towards democracy and respect for human rights  there is a need for the disarmament negotiations to include conventional weapons. It should be emphasized that the ""peace dividend"" from disarmament efforts should be channelled into fighting the problems of poverty  disease and backwardness in developing countries. It goes without saying that the opportunities created in the past few years to secure a more just and stable international order cannot bear fruit unless there is a parallel effort  deployed with increased vigour  to bring about positive change in international economic relations. In this regard  much more is expected from the United Nations. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio  Brazil  in the middle of this year demonstrated the great importance that the international community attaches to the pressing issues of the environment and development. Environmental protection and economic development bear on the future of mankind and affect every country. Therefore  our collective and individual strategic planning activities should be aimed at solving these two global problems  which call for effective international cooperation and mutual consultation. The Rio Declaration and Agenda 21  as well as the two Conventions  the Convention on climate change and the Convention on biological diversity  lay a good foundation for enhanced international cooperation in this area. However  there has yet to be sufficient focus on the problems of environmental pollution and ecological degradation and desertification. We should like to share certain fundamental thoughts about the promotion and strengthening of democracy and democratic institutions in the context of current international relations. Although democracy may have certain universal features  it is equally true that it has unique characteristics peculiar to a particular country's socio-political situation. In effect  there cannot be a standard prescription for building democracy applicable to all societies and situations. Realization of this fact should restrain any attempt to prescribe uniform modalities and processes for the establishment of democracy and democratic institutions in different countries. It is incumbent upon those who claim to stand for democracy to help newly democratizing peoples in their effort to consolidate that process  rather than confine themselves to levelling criticism from the sidelines. If those forces that advocate the strengthening of democracy fail to extend a helping hand to us in our unrelenting struggle to democratize our country  and instead simply  watch from a distance  any weakening or failure of the process of democratization will be attributable  at least in part  to their lack of cooperation. It goes without saying that democracy is unthinkable without peace and stability  both internal and inter-State. Thus support by the forces of democracy for internal democratization processes would be a significant step forward in the resolution of internal conflicts. Inter-State conflicts can be settled by democratizing inter-State relations and by scrupulously observing norms of international law for inter-State relations. Although the parties to an inter-State dispute are primarily responsible for the peaceful resolution of their problems  the United Nations and the international community can  and should  play a significant role in encouraging the peaceful settlement of disputes. Sanctions could be applied as a last resort against a recalcitrant party violating basic norms of inter-State relations once all other attempts to resolve disputes had been fully exhausted. It is evident that democracy cannot be nurtured and sustained to grow into a robust institution in countries characterized by economic deprivation and destitution. It is therefore imperative to democratize the international economic order with the same vigour as we are deploying to democratize the international political order  if we are to strengthen democracy and democratic institutions.  To this end  developing countries  as a whole  should be given assistance to extricate themselves from the quagmire of poverty and underdevelopment. Failure by the developed countries to do so would mean exacerbating international tension and conflict in a different form  thereby adversely affecting all our efforts towards lasting peace and socio-economic development. In order to forestall such an eventuality  the United Nations and the international community should go beyond paying lip-service to democracy and development and provide meaningful economic assistance to developing countries. Only then will we be able to say that international peace and development are guaranteed. At this juncture  allow me to say a few words on developments in Ethiopia since the establishment of the Transitional Government just over a year ago. The demise of the repressive military regime in May 1991  the assumption of power by democratic forces and the endorsement of the Transitional Charter have heralded a new chapter in the history of our country in which freedom  equal rights and self-determination of all peoples are the guiding principles of political  economic and social life. During this short period  while striving to ensure durable peace and stability after 30 years of bloody civil war  we have been able to lay the groundwork for the creation of a new political order in a country where very little was known about democratic political and institutional machinery. The Transitional Charter laid the basis for the establishment of a broad-based administration incorporating a wide spectrum of political views  regional interests and national aspirations. The Council of Representatives  which is the highest legislative authority  consists of dozens of political and social organizations. Moreover  with a view to paving the way for the implementation of the right to self-determination of all peoples in Ethiopia as enshrined in our Transitional Charter  we have taken the the first significant step by holding the first successful democratic  local and regional elections in the country's history in the presence of international observers. An administration aimed at the consolidation of peace  stability  democracy  reconstruction and development in the country is now firmly in place. The protection of human rights is at the top of the agenda of the Transitional Government. For the first time  internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms are fully guaranteed in Ethiopia. The Transitional Government is fully committed to upholding and protecting the rights of individuals and peoples based on the Universal Declaration of Human Sights. To that end  we have initiated a process by which Ethiopia is to accede to the various international Covenants on human rights. The Transitional Government of Ethiopia was established under circumstances left by the country's former absolute dictatorship. It was a situation where government accountability and responsibility were unknown  democratic culture and institutions were non-existent and where the country's infrastructure was devastated by a long drawn-out war and recurrent drought and famine. Although the absence of a pluralistic political culture and institutional machinery  as well as Ethiopia's only recent emergence from an extended period of intense civil war  has had a significant impact on democratization  in general the process of democratization  decentralization and devolution of power in Ethiopia is right on track. However  this does not mean that the transition from war to peace and from dictatorship to democracy is a smooth one. Indeed  we chose to go through a transition process with a view to making it possible for us to lay down the necessary preconditions for a full-fledged democratic order. We have made significant progress in all these areas during the past year of the transitional period. As part of the continuing process of democratization  the Council of Representatives has issued a proclamation on the setting up of a Constitution Drafting Commission  which is about to embark upon its important task as soon as organizational matters are finalized. The lesson we have drawn from the first year of the transitional period is that the establishment of democracy  dependable democratic institutions and democratic culture in a least developed country such as Ethiopia  with an economy devastated by war and natural calamities  is an extremely arduous undertaking. However committed one may be or however strenuously one may strive to achieve this goal  the process is bound to be very slow and full of difficulties and complications. This is not a sign of despair but an acknowledgment of a concrete reality  which is a necessary first step to success in any undertaking. Undaunted by the adverse internal situation at the outset  the Transitional Government took  and is taking bold and decisive steps to lay the groundwork for the socio-economic transformation and democratization of the country. Thus  building democratic institutions  carrying out major economic reforms  instituting human rights and fundamental freedoms previously unknown in Ethiopia  such as freedom of assembly and association  freedom of expression without censorship  encouraging the formation of numerous political organizations which are now exercising democratic rights without any hindrance: these are only the most salient achievements of the Transitional Government in the brief period of one year. As a result  we can assert with full confidence that a new democratic culture and new democratic institutions are taking shape in our country today. The unity of Ethiopia is being guaranteed on the basis of the unswerving recognition and accommodation of diversity. Bold  and in many ways unique  steps are again being taken to resolve the country's internal problems. Although problems may persist  our internal experiment aimed at their solution is already paying dividends. The Eritrean question has also been resolved by the recognition of the right to self-determination of the Eritrean people. A referendum will be held early next year in the presence of international observers  including the United Nations  to determine definitively the future status of Eritrea. The decision to resolve the Eritrean question through a referendum has been subscribed to without reservation by both the Transitional Government of Ethiopia and the Provisional Government of Eritrea. They have also declared in no uncertain terms that they will accept the results of the referendum. In effect  the decision is ours  and ours alone  and belongs in no way to any external force. We are confident that once the people of Eritrea have freely decided their own future  no matter what the outcome of the referendum  the existing and fast-developing economic  trade and social relations between the two peoples based on mutual trust and benefit will be the trail-blazer for economic and social integration in the Horn of Africa subregion  which we hope will materialize in the not-too-distant future. As regards our economic situation  it has been repeatedly stated that Ethiopia's economic potential contrasts sharply with its socio-economic underdevelopment. In addition to drought  war and famine  the mismanagement of the national economy over the years by the former regime has militated against steady growth by the national economy. Under these rather difficult circumstances  the transitional Government of Ethiopia has embarked upon a comprehensive programme of new economic policy measures and institutional reform aimed at increasing the role of the private sector in the national economy  and is rationalizing the public enterprises by improving their management and generally allowing the promotion of market-economy principles and mechanisms. It is imperative for us to exert the maximum effort to overcome the multifaceted problems facing the country today and revitalize our national economy. However  it is evident that such an undertaking calls for the availability of vast resources which cannot be mobilized at the national level alone. We therefore call on the international community to extend humanitarian as well as development assistance to supplement our domestic efforts to cope with the emergency situation. The positive response and good will demonstrated by various donor countries and international organizations over the past year in support of our economic recovery and reconstruction programme are encouraging. We are hopeful that that support will continue. The changes under way in Ethiopia are having an impact on the country's external relations. Thus  for the first time in several decades  our relations with all our neighbours in the Horn of Africa are being strengthened on a qualitatively new level. Harmonious cooperation in all fields is fast developing in our subregion. Our relations with other countries are also developing on the some basis and are showing encouraging results. In this new experiment of nation-building  Ethiopia has from the outset enjoyed the good will of many countries. Some have also extended material assistance. We wish to express our deep gratitude to all who have helped us in one way or another. Nevertheless  we have  regrettably  to admit the fact that the assistance we have so far received  in particular material assistance  falls short of what is needed to make our effort at socio-economic development a success. We therefore call again upon all our friends to provide us with meaningful assistance at this crucial phase in our history. In conclusion  I should also like to reiterate Ethiopia's readiness to participate in all endeavours aimed at enhancing the role of our Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security and in assisting the developing countries in their efforts to achieve a greater degree of economic development and self-reliance. I am hopeful that at the present session the Assembly will review and assess the world situation with a new perspective and take a bold approach in order to meet the imperatives of the time. We must encourage and promote the positive trends already evident in international relations  and at the same time guard against certain tendencies which patently carry within them the seed of new crises. "
"53",2328,"FIN",47,1992,"I wish to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. He can rest assured that the delegation of Finland will render him its full support in his challenging task. On behalf of my Government I wish also to extend a warm welcome to the 13 new Members amongst us. Their participation in the work of the United Nations will further strengthen the Organization. Since the beginning of this year the United Nations has had a new Secretary-General. Faced with many difficult challenges  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has already shown  in word and in deed  that he is firmly in charge. We wish him all success in his work. The United Nations Charter was drafted under dramatic circumstances during the final stages of the Second World War. After two world wars  the United Nations was given the responsibility for maintaining peace and security for future generations. Now  decades later  the Organization also faces a multitude of other major challenges: those of development  protection of the environment and promotion of democracy and human rights. Courageous and visionary leadership is now called for to create a new United Nations for a new international era. The Security Council demonstrated such leadership at its historic summit meeting held in January. After decades of cold war  the summit set new priorities for the United Nations in the promotion of peace and security worldwide  and provided guidelines for a more active United Nations involvement in the maintenance of peace. In response to the initiative taken by the Security Council summit the Secretary-General has submitted an excellent report under the title ""An Agenda for Peace"". In it he has innovatively addressed the question of how the full potential of the United Nations can be most effectively used in the service of peace and international security. The report is a comprehensive effort by the Secretary-General to relate preventive diplomacy  peace-making and peace-keeping  as well as peace-building  to the changing political and security requirements of the world today. I am especially pleased to note that the Secretary-General's thinking and many of his recommendations are well in line with what Finland  often together with the other Nordic countries  has itself long advocated. As expressed so clearly in the Secretary-General's report  it is not sufficient that the United Nations should succeed in putting an end to conflicts. The best way to deal with conflicts is to prevent them. This is a complicated but vital task  where the capacity of the United Nations should be considerably strengthened. Different methods could come into question  depending on the specific circumstances of each case. But the necessary basis for any prevention is continuous information-gathering and monitoring exercised both by the Secretary-General and by the Security Council. Early deployment of monitors or peace-keepers should be considered whenever necessary for effective prevention. May I add that we are also grateful to the Secretary-General for the innovative treatment of post-conflict  comprehensive peace-building in his report. When the capacity of the United Nations to keep peace and prevent conflicts has been stretched to its limit  it is natural that other means should be taken under consideration. Here regional organizations and agencies can play a significant role. The Secretary-General's repeated calls for closer cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and regional organizations are well-founded. At its Helsinki Summit in July  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) responded constructively. CSCE has strengthened its capacity for conflict management and peace-keeping. We also support the Secretary-General's idea of periodic consultations between the United Nations and regional arrangements on confidence-building measures. The tragic situation in former Yugoslavia shows clearly how a complex problem requires an innovative approach. Under the joint leadership of the United Nations and the European Community  the Conference  with its six working groups  is seeking solutions to the multitude of political  ethnic  humanitarian and other problems in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. CSCE is also actively engaged in supporting the settlement of the conflict.  In this context  let me say that Finland supports the Security Council recommendation to the General Assembly that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should apply for membership in the United Nations and should not participate in the work of the General Assembly in the meantime. While regional organizations should play a greater role in dealing with threats to security in their respective regions  the United Nations  through its Security Council  retains  of course  its unique and primary role and special instruments in maintaining international peace and security. The Secretary-General reminds us of the most potent instrument available to the Security Council  Article 42 of the Charter. We agree with him that the last-resort option of taking military action is essential to the credibility of the United Nations as a guarantor of international security. While not underestimating the problems involved  we believe that the Security Council and all Members of the Organization should seriously consider the proposals of the Secretary-General concerning peace-enforcement units  as well as the negotiation of agreements in accordance with Article 43 of the Charter. Proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a major threat to international peace and security. International norms of non-proliferation should be strengthened through universal and credible adherence to them. Finland welcomes the recently concluded chemical-weapons convention. It is a vital and long-awaited part of the international non-proliferation regime and should attract as many original signatories as possible. Finland  for its part  will be among the first States to sign and ratify the convention. Unrestrained accumulation of conventional arms can lead to regional instability. It is therefore essential that especially the major arms-exporting countries should exercise restraint individually and collectively. It is also necessary that all relevant transfers should be fully reported to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms. The Security Council summit represented a firm recommitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The Secretary-General  for his part  has seized the momentum and turned this new commitment into a programme for concrete action. In the promotion of peace and security  this is indeed the beginning of a new era in the history of the United Nations. On the same positive note  I should like to turn to another summit  the Earth Summit  held at Rio de Janeiro. Alongside the task of maintaining peace and security  a new equally courageous and visionary leadership is called for on sustainable development. At Rio a remarkable number of Heads of State and Government responded to that call and drew guidelines for world-wide sustainable development. Although our expectations could not all be fulfilled  the Earth Summit showed that the United Nations and the international community can achieve remarkable results when minds meet. Yet Rio was only the beginning of a long process towards sustainable development. In that process  a fundamental change is needed first and foremost in attitudes a change in our own life-styles. And we need a strong political will to direct that change. A sustainable future can be brought about only by putting the treaties agreed upon at Rio into force and by translating the principles of the Declaration and Agenda 21 into action. In this the Commission on Sustainable Development will have an essential role to play.  The conventions signed at Rio are just an initial core for a comprehensive legal framework  which should guide mankind in the right direction. What we do need is a full set of internationally binding agreements which redirects production and consumption patterns in each and every country. We also need effective conventions covering natural resources. Here instruments on desertification and sustainable forestry are the most urgent ones. The future of mankind requires sustainable development  management and conservation of forests of all types of forests everywhere. Forests have both an important national dimension and an important global dimension. Forests are a valuable national resource which must be utilized for the benefit of the local population. Sustainable forestry is also economically beneficial. While the sovereignty of nations over their forest resources should be respected  that sovereignty should not be misused. Finland  for its part  is prepared to participate actively in launching the negotiations on the global forest convention on the basis of the forest principles agreed upon at Rio. Here we have to build a better understanding of the need for such an international instrument. We also have to build mutual confidence founded on the unique role of forests in the global ecosystem. To implement what was agreed at Rio is a tall order for any country  and particularly for developing countries. Many of them will need the assistance of the international community and the United Nations. New and additional resources required by developing countries must be provided in a timely manner. That is a heavy task for the donor community  as it has to shoulder the responsibility of also assisting the new democracies in transition. The results of the Earth Summit do indeed underline the unique and indispensable role of the United Nations in promoting development. They will have a crucial impact on the entire economic and social sector of the United Nations and on the work of the Economic and Social Council. Development deserves the same priority and attention as peace and security. Development is not only economic and social progress; it is also promotion of democracy and human rights. No longer do questions of violations of human rights belong exclusively to the sovereign domain of States. On the contrary  respect for human rights and democracy is an integral part of international relations. It is therefore one of the main responsibilities of the United Nations to see to it that they are respected world wide. The Economic and Social Council is the principal organ of the United Nations for development. It is important and urgently necessary that the Economic and Social Council be strengthened so that it can gain the true leadership role for sustainable development and promotion of human rights and democracy. The demands put on the United Nations today are unprecedented. New challenges have to be met and financed. Finland shares the Secretary-General's concerns regarding the Organization's ability to function in the present financial crisis. We are therefore willing to consider constructively any of his proposals. Finland is particularly anxious to see the General Assembly take the first step recommended by the Secretary-General: the establishment of a peace-keeping reserve fund to meet the initial expenses of peace-keeping operations pending receipt of assessed contributions. The Nordic countries have long advocated this step. With the recent expansion of operations  the need for such a fund is acute. It is not in keeping with the honour  interests or legal obligations of the Member States for the United Nations to exist in ""its present mendicancy""  to use the words of the Secretary-General. For members of any club  paying dues is <¬ª duty  not an option. While exceptional measures may be needed to guarantee the uninterrupted functioning of the United Nations in the present crisis  the overall funding of the Organization must be built on the collective responsibility of the entire membership. We have a common interest to invest in improved security and development towards a more prosperous and democratic world. The United Nations Charter remains fully valid today as regards the maintenance of international peace and security and  by and large  also as regards the promotion of international cooperation in the economic  social  and human rights sectors. In facing the new challenges  especially in the promotion of sustainable development and democracy  the primary issue is how we can best build on the Charter and even amend it  where necessary. As it approaches the end of the second millennium  humanity is faced with formidable challenges. Meeting them will not be easy; I have no illusions about that. Yet the United Nations now has a. better chance than ever to use its full potential and show leadership for the sake of a better future. "
"54",2372,"FJI",47,1992,"It is my honour and privilege  on behalf of the Government and people of Fiji  to convey to you. Sir  our warmest congratulations upon your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that under your distinguished leadership the Assembly at this session will be guided to a most successful conclusion.My delegation extends its deep appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for his exemplary leadership during the last session of the General Assembly. Since our last session  a year ago  several new Members have joined the Organization. My delegation welcomes them most warmly. We believe that the near-universality of membership of the United Nations that we now have can lead to greater understanding and ultimately to concrete action in the search for lasting solutions to many of the problems facing our global community. The report of the Secretary-General is broad  and it demonstrates the complexity of the issues that concern the world today. My delegation commends the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report and for the important steps he has taken to carry out the various tasks that our Organization has assigned to him. We hope that at its forty-seventh session the General Assembly will help to find real solutions to these problems. The last few years have been a period of profound changes. With the end of the cold war  we have witnessed a new wave of nationalism surging in several parts of the world. This reflects an intense yearning for self-determination  especially in the political and economic spheres. At the same time  we have seen the world economy moving towards even greater interdependence and integration. In these developments  we see bright prospects and opportunities  but we also see the emergence of new problems  greater uncertainties and more unresolved inequities. In the Horn of Africa in Somalia a human tragedy of unprecedented dimensions is unfolding. War  drought and the collapse of civil authority threaten the lives of millions. Starvation has already claimed the lives of thousands of Somalis. All international efforts to respond to the overwhelming needs of the people of Somalia must be stepped up. We fully support the United Nations in its role in Cambodia  and we have contributed 50 police personnel to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The task facing UNTAC is certainly not easy. Fiji believes that the Cambodian people must be given the opportunity to determine freely their own political destiny and to enjoy the peace  stability and well-being to which they have aspired for so long. We hope that the reform process in South Africa can build on the progress that has already been made. We urge that the efforts to dismantle apartheid proceed as quickly as possible so that more deaths and bloodshed may be avoided. The international community must continue to assist the people of South Africa in their endeavour to bring an effective end to violence and to create the conditions for dismantling of apartheid in their country. My country commended both Koreas for taking seats last year as new Members of this Organization. It is encouraging to note that since then the two Koreas have intensified their dialogue and that they are taking important steps to strengthen further the ties between their two countries. The reunification of the Koreas will go a long way towards ensuring peace and stability in North-East Asia. Fiji welcomes the Middle East peace process that is taking place. We hope that the parties concerned will seize the opportunity to seek a comprehensive and just solution to the Middle East issues  in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions. We call upon all the parties involved to make every possible effort and to demonstrate all possible understanding  with a view to bringing about a just and permanent peace in the area. Fiji has already lost several of its soldiers engaged in peace-keeping duties in the cause of peace in the area. We therefore firmly believe that a positive outcome to the process would be a fitting tribute to all those gallant soldiers who died for the noblest cause in our world - the cause of peace. The gap between the developed countries and the developing countries has widened. The world's population has grown to 5.5 billion  and much of the growth has taken place in the developing countries  which are home for 77 per cent of the world's people. Moreover  about 1.4 billion of the world's people live in extreme poverty  and the external debt of developing countries continues to grow. As Fiji is a developing country  faced with its people's rising expectations of improved conditions of living  we believe that the international community must make every effort to address and find solutions to the economic problems that we face. We urge the United Nations to continue to play a catalytic role in the creation of an international economic environment that will enhance the economies of the developing and underdeveloped countries of the world. I am aware that a process of review and revitalization of the United Nations is already under way. We in Fiji fully support the process  and I urge all Members of the Organization to do likewise so that programmes to meet the challenges of closer international cooperation may be created. We welcome the reforms that have already been put in place to strengthen the Economic and Social Council. The Charter envisages the Council's being able to provide Member States and relevant bodies and agencies within the United Nations system with overall direction and guidance on all matters relating to social and economic development. The Council should explore new needs  priorities and opportunities for joint international action and should coordinate them. A sense of priority in such changes will strengthen the impact of resolutions. My Government firmly believes that the private sector has a pivotal role to play in the development of the economy and therefore of the nation. We are taking a number of steps to enhance and facilitate private-sector activity. In this regard  as a relatively small island State  we welcome several private-sector initiatives which the United States of America has announced for our region  including the proposed United States-Pacific island countries joint commercial commission. Fiji also strongly supports efforts to liberalize world trade  and in particular we look forward to a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. In fact  Fiji is already committed to giving the smaller Pacific island countries in our region duty-free access to our markets for a number of commodities and products. To ensure the economic development of developing countries  it is vital that our exports be ensured greater access to markets of developed countries. The terms of trade for developing countries' exports  especially for commodities  should also be significantly improved. There can be no doubt that the only credible option for generalized prosperity and development is a truly open and liberalized trading system. The Government of Fiji is committed to this objective. In the last few years our own trade regime has been liberalized considerably. Import quotas have been replaced with tariffs. The Government remains committed to continuous and steady reductions in the overall level of import protection. In addition  we are continuing to pursue a policy of attracting foreign investments through generous incentives to foreign investors wishing to set up export and manufacturing facilities in our country. My country was pleased to participate in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro  in June. I reaffirm our full commitment to the several decisions taken at the Conference  including the Rio Declaration  Agenda 21  the Framework Convention on Climate Change  the Convention on Biodiversity and the Statement on forest principles. My Government supports the proposed commission on sustainable development  which is to be discussed later in this session. We particularly support the proposal that the commission be the main forum for consultation and leadership on the implementation of Agenda 21 at the global  regional and national levels. The commission should be able to review progress in implementation of Agenda 21  as well as provide a forum for further development and updating in the light of all future developments in the technological  legal  economic  financial and other areas. To be effective  the commission must be supported by a. small and well-organized secretariat. Global warming and a rise in the sea level pose serious threats to the very existence of a number of our neighbouring small island States in the South Pacific  and  I dare say  in other parts of the world. We welcome  therefore  the Framework Convention on Climate Change as an important first step towards addressing these threats. We want to see the Convention put into effect as early as possible. Negotiations of protocols should commence soon  especially on targets and timetables for the reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. We also welcome UNCED's call for a series of meetings and conferences on the sustainable development of small island countries. Fiji supports the  convening of the first global conference on small island states' sustainable development and its implications  and we will eagerly follow progress on the arrangements for the conference. Agenda 21 also called for conferences on the conservation and management of fish resources  one of the main sources of livelihood for many of our small island countries. Fiji endorses the Agenda 21 chapter on marine living resources and  in particular  the proposed United Nations intergovernmental conference to address the issue of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory species in the context of the Convention on the Law of the Sea. UNCED was a major step forward  but the next step may be more difficult. The spirit in which the various agreements were conceived and adopted needs to be matched by their speedy implementation. We are pleased that a good start has been made with the recently announced ""Capacity 21"" initiative by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  which aims at providing support to developing countries in the preparation and management of their own sustainable development plans. This initiative will go a long way towards translating Agenda 21 into effective national programmes. Today the world recognizes that basic human and social dimensions of development have long been neglected. UNDP's latest ""Human Development Report"" reminds us that development means involving people  placing them at the centre of all decision-making. At the United Nations  we  too  must place people at the centre of all our activities. I ask Member States to support the proposed world summit for social development  to be convened in 1995. The summit should elevate important  social issues and allow socio-economic questions to be addressed more comprehensively than has been done in the past. Furthermore  the International Conference on Population and Development  to be convened in Egypt in September 1994  will provide an added focus on the relationship between population and.social development. My country looks forward to participating in both conferences. We have received the report of the Secretary-General  ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  containing his constructive analysis and recommendations on ways to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy  peace-building and peace-keeping. We applaud the Secretary-General for his pertinent recommendations and for some of the measures that he has already taken. Peace-keeping has eased tension and conflicts in several areas of the world. Fiji takes pride in being one of the countries contributing troops that are helping to promote and maintain peace in different parts of the world. We support the extension of United Nations peace-keeping into new fields  including the prevention of conflicts and peace-building  as suggested by the Secretary-General in his report to the Assembly. We recognize  however  that peace-keeping operations can be successful only with the full cooperation of the parties and a clearly defined mandate from the Security Council. As a former military officer  I know only too well that peace-keeping costs money and that financial contributions to our Organization are vital to the ultimate goal of secure and lasting peace in our universe. My delegation appreciates the undertaking by previous speakers to ensure adequate financial support for United Nations peace-keeping and humanitarian activities. It is perhaps appropriate at this point to remind this gathering that when the former Deputy Prime Minister of Fiji  the Honourable Josefata Kamikamica  addressed the Assembly in 1991  he indicated that my country would hold a general election in 1992 under our new Constitution. A peaceful general election  in which all the major political parties participated  was held in May this year. Since then  we have had two sessions of the new Parliament. I felt constrained to mention this because there is a growing demand in the world today for democracy  a necessary aspect of which is the holding of regular elections. Previous representatives of my country who have addressed the Assembly within the last four years adverted to the changes which had taken place and were still taking place in Fiji on the new Constitution that was promulgated in 1990 on the basis of recommendations by an independent multiracial national commission. I take great pleasure in informing this assembly of the world that my Government has committed itself to a review of the 1990 Constitution of Fiji. Preparatory work has already begun with regard to the mechanism and procedures for implementing this review. All communities in Fiji will be consulted fully in the review process. It will also involve the representatives of the people in Parliament and all the political parties. As of December 1988 indigenous Fijians numbered about 345 000 out of a total population of 720 000. Fiji is their indigenous homeland. In fact  the Fijians  through their mataqalis land-owning units own 83 per cent of all the land in Fiji. We have a distinct culture and identity which we must  of necessity  foster and develop for the very survival of the Fijian race. My Government is committed to providing continuing special assistance to the indigenous Fijians until they achieve comparable economic status with the other communities in Fiji  in keeping with the indigenous policies and programmes in many of our member countries. I should also like to express my Government's sincere and deep appreciation of the valuable efforts of the Working Group on Indigenous People in drafting the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. My Government  while reviewing our Constitution  is also committed to taking into account the meaning and obligations of this United Nations Declaration and all the recent developments in international and constitutional law on indigenous and tribal rights. My Government also supports the declaration of 1993 as the International Year for the World's Indigenous People. And while we look forward to observing 1993 as the International Year for the World's Indigenous People  we are also coming to the close of a very important year  the International Year for Disabled Persons. The disabled are present in every class  in every race  in every culture and in every country. A feature the disabled share with indigenous groups is that  while they are present  they are often not heard. We commend the United Nations for its efforts all along  including this year  in bringing to the fore the concerns of the disabled. My country remains committed to the work of the Special Committee on decolonization. The success that has been achieved so far should not lead us to forget what remains to be done. In the South Pacific region  we are encouraged by the measures being taken by the French Government under the Matignon Agreements to provide a framework for New Caledonia's evolution towards self-determination and independence. My Government welcomed the French Government's decision to allow a South Pacific ministerial mission to visit New Caledonia last year and to facilitate regular visits by United Nations missions in the future. We look forward to the mid-term review of the Matignon Agreements towards the end of the year. We consider this essential in ensuring that progress is maintained towards the decolonization of New Caledonia. Fiji will continue to oppose nuclear testing and the dumping of nuclear and other toxic wastes in the South Pacific region. The cessation of these activities is vital for our very survival and the preservation of our fragile ecosystem. We in the South Pacific welcome the recent decision by France to suspend its nuclear testing in the region. We are greatly encouraged by France'^ accession to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty  and we hope that France will also become a party to the Protocol of the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty. At the same time  my Government also welcomes the decision by the United States to cease the operation of its chemical-weapons incineration facility at Johnston Atoll. We also applaud Japan's decision to cease large-scale drift-net fishing  often described as the ""Wall of Death""  in our South Pacific waters  and we in that region earnestly pray that other distant-water-fishing nations will soon make similar decisions. Secure and lasting peace in our world is what we must all aspire to. Disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction are essential requirements for peace. I believe that the Members of this Organization  all of us  should work together with total commitment to create and maintain secure and lasting peace on our planet  and simultaneously to increase and expand economic and social benefits to all the peoples of our world. Finally  our world today is what we  its nations  make it. With a knowledge of yesterday  with our experiences of today  let us all  great and small  rich and poor  as Members of this international Organization  rededicate our energies and efforts and commit ourselves to building a better world for us and for those generations which come after us. "
"55",2419,"FRA",47,1992,"Allow me to congratulate you. Sir  on your election as President of our General Assembly. Your outstanding abilities earned a unanimous vote  which is a tribute both to your country and to the example it sets in its newly regained freedom. Speaking from this rostrum last year  I welcomed the extraordinary winds of freedom which were sweeping oppressive regimes away everywhere in the world. I recalled the support that my country had always given to peoples' right to self-determination. I rejoiced at the promises of independence which arose on the ruins of empires. The distance covered since then gives us grounds for hope. While in Europe the barriers around blocs tumbled  in Africa the chains of apartheid were removed and in Asia Governments contested by their people fell  new sovereign entities were established. Let us therefore welcome the delegations of the new Member States that have joined us. These successes are also successes for our Organization. More than ever  the principles and rules of our Charter prove their immutable value; more than ever  let us show our commitment to them. I should like to turn to Mr. Boutros-Ghali and commend the example he sets us: the example of his energy  of his entire action focused on the aims of our Organization and the application of our Charter's principles. He succeeds someone who has brought honour to our Organization. But rarely will a Secretary-General have succeeded in overcoming so many crises and challenges in the first year of his mandate. Let us therefore thank him for his efforts  his imagination and his determination.  In spite of freedom's victories  peace has not always been the child of liberation. Rivalries between neighbours  ethnic tensions and border disputes fan discord and foment insecurity to the point of provoking the return of war in all its cruelty and savagery. Yugoslavia  Liberia  Somalia: the names ring sadly in our ears  and the examples are  unfortunately  legion. Universal peace  our absolute principle  is still only an ambition. It must become our primary mission. To ensure that the paths of freedom become paths to peace everywhere  France proposes three lines of action: peace through the organization of security that is  peace-keeping operations and collective security and disarmament measures; peace through the affirmation of justice - that is  economic and social development to bring about greater fairness and equality among nations and peoples; peace through solidarity among States which know how to use their independence to establish beneficial cooperation.  Let us speak first of peace through the organization of security. The immediate need is to halt the conflicts which are causing bloodshed in Europe  the border regions of Asia and Africa. They cast a sinister shadow over the successes of freedom and independence. The United Nations  strengthened by its new influence  reacted by mounting in the space of a few months peace-keeping operations on an unprecedented scale. Never before have so many men from such a large number of countries assembled under our flag  that of the international community. Stopping the expansion of a neighbour or faction  protecting populations  helping to deliver humanitarian aid  providing reassurance and at times renewing dialogue between the parties involved such are the many sensitive missions undertaken by the United Nations and our ""Blue Helmets"". Though peaceful  these operations are dangerous. It is not a question of making war; our mission is a mission of peace. The task  always the same yet always different  must be given all possible support at the local level and all available means of suitable protection and defence. There are cases in which we must intervene even though the cease-fire in question is neither complete nor lasting. There are cases in which  to impose respect  we must have clear rules of engagement binding on everyone. We need to define  for specific situations  a right of emergency  comprising measures for warning and protection. My country has several reasons for wanting this  as I am sure you will agree. Having become the leading participant in the peace-keeping forces  with what will soon be 6 000 men under the United Nations flag in former Yugoslavia  Cambodia  Lebanon  Western Sahara and El Salvador  France has paid a heavy price. Since the start of the year. eight of its sons have lost their lives  the last ones murdered in cowardly fashion. And they have not been the only ones. From this rostrum  I should like to pay a solemn tribute to all the soldiers of peace who have sacrificed their lives for the cause we all uphold. In the face of the increasing number of crises and the human tragedies resulting from them  our world is searching for new stability. It is adapting its instruments for peace and solidarity and devising others for the new times. It is essential that everyone be mobilized  most particularly the regional organizations. The Western European Union (WEU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are in the process of shaping their future. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) is establishing its jurisdiction. In the wake of the Helsinki summit  France is now proposing to the CSCE member States the adoption of a code of conduct which would encompass and define the norms governing our collective security. This idea  which was also set out by Germany  could lead to the adoption of a treaty on security. France is also continuing and will continue to advocate establishment of a court of arbitration and conciliation to prevent conflicts. It is fortunate  moreover  that Chapter VIII of the Charter has at last  in the space of a few months  taken on its full meaning. I applaud the action of our Secretary-General  who has recommended precisely that the States members of regional organizations contribute to peace-keeping operations. His thinking concurred with that of the CSCE at the Helsinki summit and with that of France. Indeed  the United Nations remains the necessary recourse in all these instances  as the case of former Yugoslavia has shown us only too well. Our Organization confers universal legitimacy on peace-keeping operations. It is the United Nations which shoulders  if need be  the overall responsibility. Hence  what is at stake today is not to relieve the United Nations of its task but to help it perform it in the most effective manner. Yes  our peace mission is above all a matter of prevention: preventing conflicts  or preventing them from worsening and spreading. France therefore welcomed with keen interest the Secretary-General's proposals in his ""Agenda for Peace"". These set forth in outline form a charter for preventive diplomacy which is urgently needed. Once the Gulf War was over  the President of the French Republic underlined the need for new thinking. I am glad to see that this new thinking is now well under way and that France's proposals are being considered. I am also pleased that the European Community is offering specific assistance. I should like to confirm today  from this rostrum  France's commitment to make available to the Secretary-General  at any time  a contingent of 1 000 men for a peace-keeping operation. I hope that this example will be followed  for our Organization must be sure that it can react quickly and forcefully as soon as there is a threat of a conflict or a conflict flares up. Reinforcement of preventive action should also encourage us to continue thinking about the reactivation of the United Nations Military Staff Committee. It is important  in any case  to strengthen the links between the Member States and the Secretariat Department of Peace-Keeping Operations  every aspect of whose work is deserving of praise. Preventive diplomacy  along with the development of peace-keeping operations  and the greater role for regional organizations: these are two indispensable pillars of the collective security system the world needs today. But there is a third one: disarmament. At their summit meeting on 31 January 1992  the members of the Security Council recalled that disarmament is one of our Organization's priorities and how essential it is for all Member States to fulfil the obligations they have undertaken with respect to arms control and disarmament itself. The progress achieved in two years has been spectacular: a reduction in stockpiles in Europe thanks to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and the CFE 1-A; the commitment by the two super-Powers to genuine nuclear disarmament  which will be spread over a period of many years; and the convention banning chemical weapons  which for the first time will eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. This disarmament effort is accompanied for the first time by a move for transparency: all treaties are coupled with stringent verification procedures  and in Europe we have signed an ""open sky"" treaty providing for free over-flight. Monitoring is the mother of all assurances. But the illegal spread of these same weapons threatens to break the momentum for peace. The war against proliferation must be stepped up and waged relentlessly. In this area  as in others. United Nations decisions must be fully respected. New measures will no doubt be necessary  particularly given the risk of the uncontrolled proliferation of ballistic missiles. To avert the danger  let us therefore strengthen international cooperation without delay. My country has in the past put forth proposals from this rostrum to stop the development of an arms race in space. France will shortly propose a measure to enhance confidence by making it mandatory to give advance notice of firings of ballistic missiles and rockets carrying satellites or other space objects. This notification measure  if adopted  would be complemented by the establishment of an international centre  under United Nations auspices  responsible for collecting and using the data received. In deciding to suspend its nuclear tests until the end of 1992  France has shown that it is ready to help further the disarmament process. The suspension is temporary and its extension will be subject to reappraisal. Let us act so as progressively to reduce the number and power of such experiments in a lasting way. France has also made a contribution to disarmament by ratifying Additional Protocol No. 1 of the Treaty banning nuclear weapons in Latin America. In other parts of the world  it supports proposals to establish denuclearized zones  especially in South Asia  the Middle East  and Africa. My country is ready to provide guarantees for security  in conjunction with other nuclear Powers  to countries committed to establishing such zones. This year  the General Assembly begins preparing for the conference on extending the non-proliferation Treaty  to be held in 1995. The indefinite extension of this Treaty without renegotiation is an important event for international security. France  which is now a signatory of the non-proliferation Treaty  realizes that the nuclear Powers have a special contribution to make to this goal. France is ready to do its part. Collective security is the guard-rail of peace. Its development on an equitable basis will be the guarantee for all peoples. I shall now touch upon the subject of peace through greater justice by means of economic and social development. France has consistently said that there can be no lasting peace so long as some peoples are faced with extreme poverty and famine. There can be no peace so long as we seem to tolerate unacceptable discrepancies in standards of living. There can be no peace without hope for justice and for progress towards greater equality.  Responsibility for real progress in this direction above all rests with our Organization and its Members  who are continuing to focus their efforts in this direction. The United Nations family in the broadest sense the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  and all the specialized agencies is ready to assume this responsibility. However  I would like to see the nucleus of the family  the Secretariat  resume its proper role as a prime mover. What agency better than the Secretariat can appreciate and evaluate the order of priorities  provide the impetus  and avoid duplications and waste? But there can be no sustainable development in a deteriorating environment. The future of our planet requires ever closer solidarity between the North and South. Such solidarity should enable us to succeed in bringing about equitable development with due respect for the natural gifts of the Earth. The success of Rio is encouraging. But let us begin by respecting our commitment to devote at least 0.7 per cent of our gross national product to official development assistance. France will do so. It has already doubled the amount of its financing to the World Environment Fund and contributed to the establishment of a 20-billion franc programme agreed upon by the European Community. The General Assembly will shortly take up the Secretary-General's report on the results of the Rio Conference. It will have to decide among other things on the establishment of a commission for sustainable development that will be the central mechanism for following up the Conference's decisions. France  which was one of the first States to back the establishment of such a commission  hopes that it will convene at an early date  if possible in 1993   and that it will begin by examining how the pledges at Rio are to be implemented. Development and the environment remain the two major issues of the years ahead. Finally  the social dimension should not be absent from our concerns. The President of the French Republic  on 31 January 1992  gave his full support to convening a world summit on social development. Let us not forget that man must remain central to our concerns. It is for humanity  through the necessary solidarity among humans  that lasting peace will drive away the hatred and wars which still cast a pall over its future. I now turn to the subject of peace through solidarity. An important step forward has been taken with the progress of humanitarian activities that has been encouraged and supported by the United Nations. My country  which can take credit for having been a pioneer in this field  therefore welcomes the impetus which has thus been given to humanitarian action. The High Commissioner for Refugees  the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Action  and United Nations forces are cooperating in providing assistance to populations exposed to violence  be they in Iraq  Yugoslavia  or Africa. A new principle of humanitarian law is taking shape which meets the aspiration of humanity  including the most unfortunate among its members. It will be to the credit of our Organization  as the end of the century approaches  to have helped in this decisive and historic progress transcending the barriers of national jurisdictions and regulations. It was precisely to make such a point that the President of the French Republic went to Sarajevo to open the way for the arrival of relief to that martyred city. To lay down the law in this matter is essential; to act is better still. France never tires of repeating that human rights are inalienable. So long as they are not respected  no peace is legitimate. Today still  in too many places  populations are terrorized and minorities maltreated. The World Conference on Human Rights will be one of the important events and rendezvous in 1993. It will be the occasion for us to reaffirm the universality of human rights and to strengthen the effectiveness of mechanisms to ensure compliance. Humanitarian action and peace-keeping are necessary functions  but they are needed in specific circumstances. Sooner or later  peoples will have to address the necessity of renewing the ties of their solidarity and rebuilding together a space for exchanges and cooperation. Lasting peace depends on this. It is clearly inconceivable that the movement for self-determination  which was so earnestly desired  should be judged guilty after the fact of the worst regressions. The example of Yugoslavia is on everybody's mind. Can we tolerate a return to the most barbaric practices  the very names of which are an insult to the human race: the massacre of civilians  detention camps without humanitarian monitoring  ""ethnic cleansing""? A solution can only come about from two distinct measures: on one hand  the establishment of a higher framework for arbitration and conciliation; on the other  the protection of minorities. The latter  living within recognized borders  should have the benefit of guarantees  equitable representation being one and not the least such guarantee.  Hopes have been raised in places where once everything still seemed to be impossible. I would like here to pay a tribute to men of good will  including Prime Minister Panic of Yugoslavia. This is yet another reason to intensify our efforts and help the Yugoslav peoples out of their tragic impasse. Let us conceive  let us decide  and then let us impose. In Cambodia  a long-suffering people has been making its return to the international community since the Paris Agreements reached under United Nations auspices. This progress embodies a great deal of hope for the Cambodian people and for Asia as a whole  and must not be jeopardized as a result of the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to open up its zone and demobilize its forces. There is always room for discussion among partners of good will. No one should use the pretext of his own complaints to try to block a peace plan which is binding on all the signatories of the Paris Agreements and  beyond that  upon the entire international community. After so many years of war in the Middle East  the prospect of a settlement based on justice and security for all is beginning to emerge thanks to the courage and clear-sightedness of all the parties. When the time comes  the international community  through the Security Council  will have to give its guarantee to a settlement. There is still a long way to go. The European Community is contributing to this future construction. France is doing its part in this. In South Africa  in spite of the terrible traces left by the hateful system of racial discrimination  the resolve to end apartheid and build a new open city has at last won the day. I would like to express from this rostrum today France's concern at the rising violence in South Africa and tell the leaders of that country: do not destroy the enormous hope you so recently inspired. I shall mention only briefly our old Europe  since its trials and tribulations are widely known  as are its bursts of hope. I can say much  however  in only a few words. The peoples of Europe wish to speed up their march toward peace  unity and prosperity. Such is the ambition affirmed by the signatories of the Maastricht Treaty - to create a genuine union of democratic States having the redoubled strength that comes from the combination of cultures  economic means and political resolve  as Mr. Douglas Hurd said so well when he spoke previously on our behalf. I am pleased and proud that the French people voted in favour of ratifying the European unity treaty. My fellow citizens chose the only future of any value  a future which will build peace on solidarity political  economic  and human. The European Union will not be inward looking  self-centred  and closed. On the contrary  the citizens of the European Union will be patriots of the old continent become the new world. They will have a sense of solidarity among themselves  be responsive to their brothers on the rest of the continent  attached to their respective nations yet firm in the face of any heightened national sentiments which invoke nationalism only the better to divide humanity and serve designs of domination and exclusion. The collapse of the wall which separated our continent spurred the efforts toward union. Today the difficulties of this Europe  separated from us for too long  then liberated  but weakened and troubled  are yet further encouragement to us to create this pole of stability on which all Europe will be able to build its peace and prosperity. That Europe will not be self-centred. When the time comes  it will welcome its neighbours from Central and Eastern Europe as brothers. Setting the example and opening the way are the first steps of true solidarity  that same solidarity which it is incumbent on our Organization to implement. The Union will undertake to serve  the very ideals of our Charter: ""We  the peoples of the United Nations"" and now  we  the peoples of the European Union. I shall now conclude. It is incumbent on Governments  as it is on peoples  to set the example. Let us not hide from the fact that peace  like life  has no price but does have a cost. It is unacceptable for the United Nations to be foundering in an increasingly severe financial crisis. Certainly  our Organization has the necessary ambition to express at the global level that general resolve which Jean-Jacques Rousseau said is more than the simple addition of individual interests. But the sum total will be all the greater and all the more universal as the contribution of each and every one is significant and generous. The United Nations will have value only in so far as each State  in compliance with the Charter  fulfils its responsibilities. There can be no better service nor better example to humanity than to enable the duty of solidarity to prevail. Let us discharge this duty  first of all  by honouring our obligations. Peace is not a gift from heaven; it depends  above all  on human resolve. Thus a new era is opening for nations as for peoples. Today  as I speak  it is still in a state of confusion. Tomorrow  it will shine with the fires of justice  peace and solidarity. "
"56",2445,"FSM",47,1992,"It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly at the commencement of its forty-seventh session and in so doing to mark my country's first full year of membership of the United Nations. For a people that has been ruled by others  the privilege of at last having an equal voice in the community of nations is uniquely fulfilling. With that voice I now express our gratitude for the openness and generosity that we encountered among the members and within the Secretariat as we undertook our initial participation in the work of this great body. We join other members in extending heartiest congratulations to Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We wish also to thank his predecessor  Mr. Shihabi  for his truly outstanding service as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. It is indeed fortunate for us and for future generations that in the most challenging of times this body has available the leadership of individuals possessing the highest skills  energy  dedication and integrity.  In speaking of leadership  I must also  of course  mention with respect and appreciation our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He has already shown himself to be more than equal to the tremendous tasks associated with his high office. He is assured of our prayers and our continuing support. Last year  the Federated States of Micronesia was privileged to be one of the seven nations admitted to membership in the early days of the forty-sixth General Assembly. Subsequently  within the forty-sixth General Assembly  history of a special kind was written when 13 other nations were admitted to membership  and so I gladly extend the warm congratulations of my Government and people to Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on their admission to the United Nations. We are confident that in sharing with them this unique moment in history we will maintain a common bond that transcends geographic differences and gives added meaning to the concept of the brotherhood of man and nations. The extensive and comprehensive agenda to be addressed by this session of the Assembly is testimony to the ever-increasing interconnectedness of the world's nations and their peoples. While we were a non-self-governing people  we of the Federated States of Micronesia strived long and hard to achieve independence  only to find that once we had it  full self-sufficiency is neither possible nor desirable in today's world. I had the honour  recently  to accompany my President  His Excellency Mr. Bailey Olter  to the Earth Summit in Rio. That historic meeting served  among other things  to deepen our understanding of the possibilities for global international cooperation on a basis of common  but differentiated responsibilities. Among the many statements made at Rio by Heads of State  I was struck by a most appropriate quotation from Sir Francis Bacon offered by the President of Iceland Her Excellency Madame Finnbogadottir. He said  ""No one makes a greater mistake than he who decides to do nothing because he can do so little."" The President's suggestion of that thought in the context of the Earth Summit was truly inspired  but if I may be permitted  it also gives guidance to my country over the entire spectrum of international cooperation. We now realize that the Charter was meant to challenge every Member  large and small  developed and developing  to play its part in the implementation of collective decisions to approach the question  ""What can I do?"" not as a basis for inaction  but rather as a springboard for action within our means  however modest. Only by doing our rightful part do we earn the right to hope that the world community will deal effectively with such universal problems as the environment  poverty and war. Only by doing our rightful part do we earn the right to expect the direct assistance of the world community in dealing with those problems of social and economic development at home that are beyond our means to solve. Thus  my Government wishes once again to thank all those in this body and throughout the United Nations community for our kind reception here  and to renew  now with broader understanding  our commitment to the Charter and our obligations thereunder. To the modest extent that the Federated States of Micronesia has made its presence known within the past year  it has been mostly in the context of the environment  and particularly in the intergovernmental negotiating committee for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since we are a country whose land is comprised of low-lying  small islands  our entire nation finds itself in the front line  along with others similarly situated  who will be the first to suffer the devastating consequences of unchecked global warming. Rising sea levels would ultimately cover our islands  but long before that our protective coral reefs would bleach and fall victim to increasing storm surges  our agricultural crops would be ruined and our freshwater sources rendered unfit for human consumption. We are facing nothing less than the end of island civilizations that have endured for thousands of years. We participated actively throughout all the sessions of the intergovernmental negotiating committee  and we had no hesitation in signing the Framework Convention in Rio because the final text of the Convention goes far to recognize the particular vulnerability of the low-lying island States to the consequences of human-induced climate change. The real effectiveness of the Convention  however  will be measured by its protocols yet to be negotiated and in the operation of its conference of the parties and other mechanisms. That statement is particularly applicable in the case of the Framework Convention because  as we stressed to the intergovernmental negotiating committee  the scientific evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows a need for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Even the modest emissions cuts to which the industrialized countries found themselves unwilling to commit themselves at Rio must immediately be replaced by more stringent goals set by the dictates of science rather than of politics.  It is ironic that the peoples of small island countries  in seemingly idyllic settings  distanced from the stresses of industrial societies  should be the peoples with the greatest sense of urgency to get on with the business of protecting the planet. It is  nevertheless  island people who are beginning to suffer the effects of global warming; island people who are witnessing the swift and disastrous alteration of ancient weather patterns; it is island people whose homelands will be the first victims of rising sea levels. But this sad reality does not mean that the rest of the world can afford to wait  for by the time the world witnesses the effects of global warming on the islands it will be too late for the rest of the world then to take the necessary steps to save itself. Thus  we are encouraged by the adoption of the Framework Convention on Climate Change  but we look anxiously towards its prompt implementation and pray that its operation will quickly lead to actions and restraints by the industrial countries on the scale necessary in order to reach the Convention's objective. That objective is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at levels which do not adversely affect the climate. Stabilization at such levels cannot be achieved by half-hearted efforts. As United States Senator Gore recently wrote in his book ""Earth in the Balance""  ""The tide of this battle will turn only when the majority of people in the world become sufficiently aroused by a shared sense of urgent danger to join an all-out effort."" Let us earnestly hope that the signing of the Framework Convention by 155 countries at the Earth Summit was evidence of such a shared sense  and signalled the beginning of an all-out effort. The President of the Federated States of Micronesia also joined most of the other Heads of State at Rio in signing the Convention on Biological Diversity. We accept our State responsibility for conserving the biodiversity of our islands and waters  and for using those resources in a sustainable manner. We welcome the reference in the Convention to the precautionary principle with regard to applying measures to avoid or minimize threats to biodiversity. We are reassured by the specific recognition in the Convention that small island States will need new and additional financial resources and appropriate access to relevant technologies in meeting their obligations. We look forward to an early convening of the conference of the parties.  Agenda 21  in both letter and spirit  at last brings into focus the concerns of the developed and the developing world for securing an environmentally sustainable future. I believe that in a world no longer preoccupied with the super-Power conflict. Agenda 21 will come to be seen as the single most important social instrument ever negotiated. Of course  in legal effect it is only a guide  and despite its length it is only a framework. But its future impact on the domestic and foreign policies of every nation is certain to be pervasive. The establishment of the commission on sustainable development is a landmark achievement of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  and with it we see realistic hopes for turning Agenda 21 into actions. We strongly urge that the commission be situated in New York. Developing countries must participate significantly in the work of the commission  and in our case  being a small Government with limited financial resources  we are far better able to attend activities at United Nations Headquarters than anywhere else. As a Pacific island country  we ascribe particular importance to chapter 17 of Agenda 21  which addresses the protection of the oceans. This is a subject many would have put aside  feeling that the oceans are so vast and our knowledge of them so limited that we are better off concentrating on perfecting land sciences. But it appears mankind is slowly realizing that human activities on the planet can significantly affect our oceans and bring about disastrous consequences for our food supplies and even our weather.  Thus  we strongly support the call in Agenda 21 for conferences to exchange experience on coastal-zone management and on the sustainable development of small island States  and we hope that they will take place on schedule. Chapter 17 also addresses constructively the need for intergovernmental cooperation to control indiscriminate and harmful practices in harvesting sea resources. While we welcome the approaching total ban on drift nets  which have been accurately called ""curtains of death""  much needs to be done with reference to the high seas  and straddling fish stocks and highly migratory species of fish  in order to reverse already notable trends towards the disappearance of species that were once thought inexhaustible. We support the call for a conference on those topics. Chapter 18 of Agenda 21 recognizes the pressing need for improved climate forecasting  in the context of freshwater resources for human survival. The Federated States of Micronesia  along with many other island States in the middle of great oceans  has suffered repeatedly in recent years from droughts brought on by little-understood climate mechanisms. In addition. Pacific island States are already suffering widespread damage caused by tropical storms of increasing frequency  range and intensity  which we have little or no capacity to predict. This fact was stressed by the South Pacific Forum countries at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  which responded by adopting resolution 46/234  calling for relief measures that include improved forecasting capabilities. We should like to reiterate our deep gratitude to the many sponsors of the resolution and to the Assembly as a whole for adopting it.  Our deep concern for the oceans and their resources also causes us to focus very closely on the provisions of chapters 19 through 22 of Agenda 21  which deal with the management of toxic chemicals  hazardous wastes  solid wastes and sewage and radioactive wastes. In his address to the Rio Conference  President Olter of the Federated States of Micronesia expressed the hope of overcoming the attitude of developed countries ""that the Pacific Island region is a great  unpopulated void"" offering opportunities ""for convenient disposal of toxic  radioactive or otherwise harmful wastes  and for the conduct of any dangerous or obnoxious activity that cannot for reasons of public safety be carried out on home territory"". We maintain high expectations that what President Olter called the ""world's emerging sense of environmental ethics"" will prevail over past attitudes. There are already some good signs  notable among which is the decision by France to suspend nuclear-weapon testing in the South Pacific. We applaud France for taking that initiative and pray that the ugly history of nuclear experimentation in the Pacific region has reached a permanent end. But realistically  that cannot be assured so long as nations continue to manufacture  stockpile and threaten to use weapons of mass destruction. Thus  even our small islands have a large stake in the continued progress of nuclear  chemical and biological disarmament  and we look forward to supporting the implementation and extension of comprehensive treaties on these subjects. The Federated States of Micronesia especially welcomes the recent conclusion of negotiations on a chemical-weapon convention and is pleased to  be one of the original sponsors of the draft resolution to be considered at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly endorsing the convention. My Government wants to express its gratitude and congratulations to those esteemed nations that have successfully negotiated that long-awaited convention and calls on the Assembly to adopt the draft resolution. I wish to recognize with appreciation the active role that Australia  from our region  took in negotiating the chemical-weapon convention and for its outstanding contribution to the global movement towards arms control and disarmament. Unfortunately  the forsaking of nuclear  chemical and biological weaponry serves to intensify the already serious problems associated with the movement and disposal of wastes. Large stocks of chemical weapons must be eliminated  but uncertainties surrounding the technology for their disposal result in pressures on less powerful and more remote peoples  such as Pacific islanders  to bear the associated risks. Frightening quantities of weapon-grade Plutonium must either be safely stored or utilized in questionable enterprises that involve hazardous and secretive shipments through the waters of maritime nations. Up to this point the efforts of the world's nations to deal with these problems have produced a patchwork of conventions some implemented  some not most of which are of limited effectiveness because of technicalities and political self-interest. Worthwhile instruments such as the London Dumping Convention need to be strengthened on an accelerated basis. Vital arrangements such as the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal need to be implemented. The role of the International Atomic Energy Agency with regard to safeguards must be brought up to the pace of current events. But even if all these things are done  dangers and risks will continue to be imposed upon the poorer  less powerful and more remote peoples of the world unless the following principle is universally respected: the nation from which the material originates bears the complete responsibility for the cost and safety of its storage  shipment and disposal; that nation should adequately inform other nations potentially affected and should not utilize the global commons in any action related thereto over their objection. I am aware of the implications of that statement  both politically and in terms of international law  but unless the spirit it expresses can enter our international conscience and influence the behavior of nations  I fear that the passing threat of wartime holocaust will be replaced by an even less restrained and in some ways equally horrifying danger. The roads towards so many of the worthy goals to be sought by the Assembly  whether related to economics  the environment  development  human rights or international security  are haunted by the spectre of poverty. Poverty causes much environmental degradation. Poverty makes human rights irrelevant to many people of our planet  and tempts others to exploitation. Poverty contributes to destabilization of political institutions and endangers the world. No matter how dedicated are the efforts made by governments towards sustainable development and lasting international peace  and no matter how massively those efforts might be funded  I fear that a single factor fuelling the engine of poverty could render all the expenditures of resources ineffective. I am referring to exploding and uncontrolled population growth. Members are familiar with the statistics  past  present and projected. They are particularly disturbing in that the greatest rate of growth occurs in the most poverty-stricken segments of the population. Clearly  this is one of the most sensitive and difficult problems to deal with in a multilateral setting  and I respect the diversity of views on the subject. For that reason  I respect its treatment in Agenda 21  knowing that many preferred stronger and direct statements. Nevertheless  we hope that the mechanisms of Agenda 21 will help to influence the developed countries to increase funding for population-related activities. We also look forward to the International Conference on Population and Development to be held in Cairo in 1994. With regard to the protection of human rights  the Federated States of Micronesia is pleased to associate itself with the exemplary efforts made by the United States of America and other like-minded nations for the implementation of the standards for the protection of human rights as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In so doing  the Federated States of Micronesia joins in the condemnation of abuses of human rights by members of the international community. They insult our sense of common decency and the values we attach to human life - the very values governments are established to protect. Hardly a speaker in this debate has failed to voice support for the historic efforts being made by the United Nations to reorganize and reorient itself so as to cope with its emerging roles in advancing the cause of mankind. We are no exception  and in our judgement the Secretary-General has so far provided wise leadership along a most difficult path. One of the most challenging current problems is to determine the fairest and most effective means of meeting the costs associated with the Organization's expanded role in the maintenance of international peace and security. We are all aware that these costs have virtually skyrocketed over the past years  and the question of their proper allocation  we would suggest  is more complex than the simple formulas that served the purpose in former times. It is a question  naturally  involving the limits of the resources of small islands  but in our case it also involves predictability. We are determined to meet all our obligations under the Charter  financial and otherwise  but the need for us to budget strictly for developmental and other immediate requirements leaves us little flexibility to meet unforeseen demands of substantial proportions. We look forward  during this session  to participating in the exploration of ways and means to devise the fairest and most effective system for financing the role of this body in the new world order. We also look forward with confidence to the enhancement of this role as the age of multilateral cooperation truly dawns and the interdependence of all peoples of the world is seen to be the overshadowing practical reality of the future.

"57",2487,"GAB",47,1992,"May I first. Sir  on behalf of my delegation and on behalf of the Government and people of Gabon  convey to Ambassador Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria our warm congratulations on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His personal qualities and experience in international affairs undoubtedly guarantee the success of our work. Our congratulations also go to the outgoing President  Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  whom we thank for the dynamic and exemplary way in which he discharged his duties. To the Secretary-General  whose recent election to head our Organization honours all of Africa  we should like to reiterate our full support for everything he is doing to promote preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping  and particularly the peaceful advent of a new world order. His great diplomatic experience is a guarantee of the fulfilment of his commitment to carry out to the best of his ability his delicate and noble mission in the service of the entire world community. Finally  we welcome all those new States which have come upon the international political scene recently. Their arrival  we are certain  will strengthen the universality of our Organization and contribute to strengthening the bonds of solidarity between Member States. Since the end of the East-West confrontation our Organization has been demonstrating its ability fully to play the role assigned it by the Charter whenever Member States act collectively. It has demonstrated this particularly in Afghanistan  Central America  Cambodia  Kuwait and Namibia.  This solidarity should be even more effective in settling other conflicts which  regrettably  we witness elsewhere. At the very opening of this session  the situation in Somalia is particularly disquieting. How can we remain unmoved when we daily see on our television screens faces bearing the imprint of war  disease and hunger? How can we remain indifferent to the pain and tragedy of millions of women and children whose only aspiration is to live in peace in their own environment and to seek better development? Is it not indeed scandalous that in our day and age war and the use of force are still the means preferred by some to settle intercommunity problems? Undoubtedly  this is a challenge to our collective intelligence. In Somalia  as elsewhere  in a tremendous upsurge of human solidarity we must make a collective effort to put an end to the fratricidal confrontations in order to rebuild trust between communities linked by history and geography that perforce must live in harmony. For its part  and particularly in the case of Somalia  Gabon has taken concrete steps along these lines. This appeal equally applies to Mozambique  where natural catastrophes have seriously exacerbated the complexity of a conflict on which discussions are now under way. In this connection the Government of Gabon very much valued the meetings in Rome on 7 August and in Gabarone on 18 September between President Chissano and the leader of RENAMO  Mr. Alfonso Phlakama. In another region of the continent  the situation in Liberia is also a matter of grave concern. For two years now efforts to bring about peace on the part of the Economic Community of West African States have encountered obstacles despite the presence among the belligerents of 7 000 ""White Helmets"" of the disengagement forces of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). Apart from subregional action  which is highly commendable  the United Nations has provided welcome aid to the Liberian population. The international community clearly provides the necessary means for all those who  despite their own difficulties  are making a contribution to bringing about peace in those countries.  With respect to the situations in the Sudan  Rwanda  Niger  Mali and Chad  the Government of Gabon will support all initiatives to bring about a peaceful settlement of the disputes between members of the same family. With respect to the situations in the Sudan  Rwanda  Niger  Mali and Chad  the Government of Gabon will support all initiatives to bring about a peaceful settlement of the disputes between members of the same family. It is in this spirit that Gabon has often offered its good offices in the settlement of conflicts in Africa. The case of South Africa is of deepest concern to us. Indeed  the system of apartheid has still not disappeared from the South African political landscape. To be sure  a few months ago  under unprecedented international pressure  the Government in Pretoria committed itself to a policy of reform designed to eradicate this odious system. But for some months now we have been witnessing an intensification of violence as a means of political expression. The Boipatong massacre and the Ciskei events are unfortunate examples which undermine the efforts to promote dialogue  which Gabon and the international community at large so earnestly seek. The promises of the South African Government gave some comfort to all those who want a positive outcome to the situation in that country so that it can join the comity of nations through the resumption of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (COPESA) talks. But nothing at the present time would allow the international community to relax its pressure nor to reduce its vigilance with-respect to Pretoria  particularly as our Organization  whose recent initiatives deserve to be encouraged  is urgently demanding the application of the principle one-man  one-vote. With respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict  at the core of which is still the question of Palestine  the new spirit now pervading international relations  as well as the desire to reach a diplomatic solution voiced by the parties involved  are conducive to giving a fresh and lasting impetus to the peace process begun in Madrid in October 1991 which is currently continuing in Washington. How can we remain indifferent to the tragedy we are witnessing in the former Yugoslavia  particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina? Quite clearly  what we have here is a major challenge where humanitarian assistance  even with the help of military logistics  is not sufficient. Gabon  which wishes to see a speedy peaceful outcome to this conflict  highly commends the leading role now being played by the United Nations. Generally speaking  all Member States expect our Organization to play a decisive role in peace-keeping and in maintaining international security  as well as in the eradication of poverty and in the struggle against famine. That is why my country wholeheartedly supports the recommendations of the Secretary-General contained in his ""Agenda for Peace"". If it is to serve its purpose the Organization must restructure its main organs in the light of the current international situation. To this end  the political role of the General Assembly and the supervisory functions of the Economic and Social Council should be further strengthened in order to make the entire United Nations system more dynamic. Furthermore  as President Bongo requested from this rostrum  first in 1977  when he was President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  and then during the fortieth session of the General Assembly  the countries of the  third world should now be represented in the Security Council as permanent members  in order to make decision making at that level more democratic. International law is being completely rethought. Hallowed concepts of yesteryear  such as ""national sovereignty""  ""territorial integrity"" and  above all  ""non-interference in the internal affairs of States""  behind which the international community was finding it more and more difficult to hide its uneasy conscience  are now being given a new normative content. Hence  for some years now  a new concept has appeared on the international scene  and that is the ""right to interference"". It would appear  a priori  to be contradictory with these very principles of ""national sovereignty""  ""territorial integrity""  and particularly ""non-interference in the internal affairs of States""  which underlie peaceful relations among States. But to assure that this right is not selective or abused  its exercise should be the exclusive responsibility of the United Nations. Furthermore  calling into question certain of these principles is not necessarily a negative step. That step should be taken whenever these principles themselves have led to crises. In so doing  the United Nations could acquire more extended powers  and hence given the appropriate means  which would enable it to exercise that right  if need be  without any discrimination whatsoever. In his most recent report on the work of the Organization  in 1991  the former Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  wrote: ""No system of collective security will remain viable unless workable solutions are sought to the problem of poverty and destitution  afflicting the greater part of the world."" (A/46/1  p. 12. VIII) That is why United Nations action would also stand to gain if it were similarly strengthened in the economic and financial fields. In this way  it should continue in the direction it has already taken in order the better to adapt itself to the new challenges facing mankind. Economics now has a more prominent place in international relations. The creation of an increasing number of subregional and regional economic groupings  as well as the globalization of international trade  have turned our world into one immense market whose working rules should be equitable. The international community very quickly realized this requirement for complementarity and solidarity when  in 1974  it established a new international economic order. Similarly  multilateral organizations  such as the European Economic Community  by creating machinery to regulate world trade  have clearly evidenced their desire to come to the assistance of the poorer countries by creating the STABEX and SYSMIN systems. In the same vein  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has advocated for some years now constructive negotiations between producers and consumers in order to strike a better balance between world supply and demand. The efforts of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCIAD) are along the same lines. In this struggle for development  we realize that the United Nations has taken a number of initiatives  the most recent of which are: the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade  the United Nations Programme for the Economic Recovery of Africa  the Cartagena Consensus and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. We can therefore say that  generally speaking  in recent years the world has progressed to some extent towards greater solidarity among all peoples. But there are still serious grounds for concern. Despite the progress made on the debt problem  through the so-called Toronto  Houston and London measures  the question of cancelling the debts of the least developed countries  and considerably reducing them for the other developing countries  remains a burning issue  particularly for the so-called middle-income countries. Up to now Gabon  which falls into that category  has not benefited from any of these measures  whereas at the same time it has seen a sharp drop in its per capita income. It would be in the interests of no one  especially the international community  if the African countries were to go into a downward spiral of economic decline and indebtedness. Today everyone knows that the measures that have been advocated with a view to enabling our continent to escape from this impasse have  for the most part  proved to be inapplicable because they are inappropriate. The balance of payments of some of our countries has been affected by the international monetary system  which influences international exchanges. Therefore  it is urgent that the international community give much more backing to the developing countries  so that they and the African countries in particular may participate in world growth. Africa  70 per cent of whose exports consist of prime commodities  has been hard hit by the detrimental effects of the fall in the prices of those commodities  and it faces economic problems in addition to that of indebtedness. Again  Africa has undertaken a programme of economic reform  whose results because of the need simultaneously to implement political reforms and the desire of Governments to achieve consensus in respect of these programmes - have been very slow to emerge. For all these reasons the international community should promote action in three directions. First  it should stabilize  at a remunerative level  the prices of non-petroleum products; secondly  it should readjust the international monetary system by rationalizing policy on interest and exchange rates; finally  it should provide a substantial increase in public aid to African countries. In other words  we are advocating the creation and implementation of a sort of ""Marshall plan"" for the African continent. Generally speaking  the problem of combating underdevelopment is of central concern to all of mankind. This is why solidarity should not be selective. Nor should it be confined to mere declarations of intent the purpose of which is to ease one's conscience. It should  for example  take the form of a re-initiation of the process of negotiation on commodity agreements. The success of this new form of cooperation effective solidarity between peoples will affect the future of our planet and facilitate improvement of the human condition. I am quite certain that no delegation present at this meeting would like the cold war to be replaced by North-South confrontation. That being the case  it might seem illusory to pose certain problems albeit major problems concerning the environment - if  at the same time  solutions are not proposed for the benefit of those countries that have to exploit their raw materials in a more or less intensive way. Let us not be hypocritical. This is a requirement for survival  as was demonstrated recently at the Rio summit on the environment and  quite recently  at the summit of non-aligned countries. The conditions that are necessary for the preservation of the environment  which is the real heritage of mankind  should not be one-sided. The new concept of international law and the new international order  to which I have referred already  can be reviewed and corrected  and should take into account the new terms of world equilibrium. Otherwise  economic growth and democratic development will be jeopardized. Despite the acute nature of the various problems to which I have just referred  our Organization has a very gratifying record in the political and diplomatic fields. It should also demonstrate its ability to meet the new  challenges facing mankind today. These include the questions of the environment  AIDS and drugs. These subjects have introduced a new set of problems into international thinking  and they require urgent and innovative solutions. In this connection  the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development has proved correct the vision of solidarity of those who have always felt that the well-being of nations comes from consultation rather than confrontation. That Conference was a striking illustration of the ill-adaptedness of the economic choices imposed here and there in the world  by comparison with the resources available on the planet  and  I am quite certain  by comparison with the real needs of our populations. The fact that this coincided with the end of the cold war should make development as important a concept as that of collective security  which has always been one of the main concerns of the United Nations. Undoubtedly development was one of the main objectives that the founding fathers assigned to the Organization  but security needs have pushed international cooperation in this area into the background. Its reinstatement should take the form of a crusade against underdevelopment. I should like to refer here to the concept of sustainable development  which was mentioned at Rio in connection with my country's rational use of its forest lands. Gabon  which has long since advanced from the stage of simple harvesting to that of ecological management of its forest lands  could not fail to adhere to the two conventions of Sio the conventions on biodiversity and on climatic changes. Therefore  we shall be very pleased to host  in Libreville in January-February 1993  the first African meetings as a follow-up to the Rio Conference  and we extend a cordial welcome to the representatives of participating States  and wish them a pleasant stay in Gabon. I should like to conclude my remarks by calling for more solidarity -solidarity in the settlement of disputes  in international security  in co-operative relations between States and peoples  in relations between international financial institutions  and in relations between all our countries  without discrimination. In his report on the activities of the Organization the Secretary-General says: ""We need a new spirit of commonality  commitment and intellectual creativity to transform a period of hope into an era of fulfilment."" (A/47/1  para. 8) We are talking here about the advent of this new international order a world that is better and more human  one in which there is real solidarity. "
"58",2534,"GBR",47,1992,"I am privileged to speak this morning on behalf of the European Community and its 12 member States. It is a pleasure to do so under your guidance  Mr. President under the guidance of a fellow European Foreign Minister whose country has made such great progress in recent years and whose foreign affairs  under your leadership  have also made a very substantial step forward. It is also a pleasure to speak in the presence of the Secretary-General. I do not wish to heap compliments upon you at this stage  Mr. Secretary-General  but I hope that the contents of what I have to say and what we offer you in terms of support for your practical policies you will accept as an adequate compliment. As my colleagues from other regions of the world have no doubt noticed  we in the European Community are conducting a lively discussion on how to achieve the ever closer union to which we are all committed. I am not going to speak about that subject today because I want to speak about Europe and the wider world  but I do want to emphasize on behalf of us all that so far from turning away from that wider world  we in Europe are increasingly active in it. And I want to make it clear that the European Community and its member States are determined to build up the place and the role of the Community and its 12 member States in world affairs. We intend to work together for the better world order in which we all believe and we intend to carry that work forward with greater impetus and greater effectiveness. Two years ago  when I first came to speak at the Assembly  the world was celebrating the end of the cold war  the beginnings of freedom. Everyone was optimistic  because everything had changed - it appeared for the better since I had first attended a session of the General Assembly  at the height of the cold war back in the 1950s. At the end of 1992 we see things differently. The world after the cold war is a better place  but it is also less stable. We have seen both a democratic spring and a demagogic spring  an outpouring of hope but also  in places  an outpouring of hate. International order is threatened in the short term by the unleashing of extreme nationalism  of challenges to the rule of law. In the medium term we have to reinforce the system of collective security based on the United Nations. Respect for good government  respect for human rights must move to the centre of our stage. In the long term we face the threat to international peace and security posed by poverty  posed by environmental degradation. We cannot afford to postpone action on the longer-term problems while we wrestle with the short-term problems. I should to look  very briefly  at each of these three challenges in turn. The short term the immediate. Nationalism  of course  is not a fault in itself; it is a natural instinct of man in society. We see its benign manifestations in many places in the former Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia  though even there  there are problems. Yugoslavia is the worst example of the bitterness of nationalism producing intolerable results. That is why both Europe and the United Nations have to work strenuously for peace with justice  for the relief of suffering in those tortured lands of the former Yugoslavia. Since last autumn the European Community and the United Nations have indeed been working closely  the United Nations leading on peace-keeping and the European Community on peace making through Lord Carrington's Peace Conference. This cooperation has helped stop the killing in  for example  the Serb Krajina in Croatia  where the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the European Community monitoring mission have achieved a good result. As conflict escalated  particularly in Bosnia  the United Nations and the European Community decided with wide international support to harness their efforts more closely together through the process launched by the London Conference last month. The International Conference on the former Yugoslavia is now working in Geneva under the co-chairmanship of Mr. Cyrus Vance for the United Nations and Lord Owen for the European Community. It is powered by the determination of the international community to bring an end to the violence in the former Yugoslavia. The Conference has two main objectives: humanitarian and political; to alleviate the suffering of the victims of the conflict and to bring that conflict permanently to an end by negotiating a political settlement. This is  of course  difficult work  requiring a deep understanding of the problems  requiring the respect and cooperation of the parties  requiring the unstinting support and  when necessary  the mobilizing of pressures from the international community. In this context  I believe that Prime Minister Panic's new approach shows great courage and I salute that courage. It offers a different way forward which we believe should be supported. But while the killing and suffering continue  as they did yesterday and as they do today  we cannot relax our efforts. We have to measure progress by deeds and not promises. We have to continue to deal with other problems left by the rolling back of the cold war. In Cambodia  we must not let the peace process drift. The Khmer Rouge have not joined phase II of the cease-fire arrangements. They are delaying the implementation of the comprehensive political settlement. On the positive side  the military deployment of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is now fully complete and the civilian component is beginning to take control of the key ministries. We have to make every effort to hold to the timetable for elections next April. Some States still show a willingness to challenge the rule of international law and  indeed  to resort to terrorism. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq was the first test of the post-cold-war era  and the liberation of Kuwait was one of this Organization's great successes. Unfortunately  we have to note that Saddam Hussein continues to defy the United Nations  that his Government is failing to meet Iraq's obligations under Security Council resolution 687 (1991)  that he continues to repress his own population  particularly in northern and in southern Iraq. That is why pressure must and will - continue until he implements the resolutions of the United Nations in full. The message has to be that all States must comply with Security Council resolutions. We still wait for Libya to implement Security Council resolution 731 (1992). Those are just some of the short-term challenges that we have to meet. There are long-running problems which we must not forget  and one of particular concern to the European Community is Cyprus. This year  Mr. Secretary-General  you have made an energetic effort. It is not yet decisively successful. You are renewing the effort next month. There is a need for fresh impetus  it seems to us  on the key issues of territory and displaced persons. There must be a willingness to negotiate on all sides; otherwise there will be no lasting settlement. You have our full support  Mr. Secretary-General  as you renew your effort. Not only does it deserve to succeed  but it is in the crucial interest of Europe and the international community that it should succeed. In the medium term we have to build a stronger system of collective security. And here  everybody looks  rightly  to the United Nations. But as the Secretary-General has pointed out  we are in danger of loading the Organization with too heavy a burden: a burden of intervention and a burden  in effect  of partial administration. ""Something must be done."" That phrase is on many lips; it is the impulse which we all feel as we read about or as we watch on television screens some fresh evidence of man's inhumanity to man. But we have to realize where that impulse  that phrase ""Something must be done""  leads us. We should not wander down that road without serious thought because it would involve a restructuring of armed forces so that they could take a full part in the growing number of peace-making and peace-keeping exercises of the United Nations. It would mean a massive increase in the funds which the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies would require from Member States from us: from all of us in regular contributions and in aid  in times when many Member States face severe budgetary problems. These are just two of the implications of the course on which the world is beginning to propel the United Nations because ""something must be done"". How do we prevent these demands from getting out of hand? The best way  of course  is to prevent those conflicts which give rise to the demands - in short  diplomacy: preventive diplomacy. I know that diplomacy is unfashionable in the world of the knee-jerk reaction and the dogmatic sound-bite on television. Diplomacy lacks news value; it lacks glamour; it involves compromise; it takes time; it is easy to mock. It just happens to be indispensable. That is true  to take one example of many one could take  of conflicts in the Middle East. There the parties have from time to time tried to cut the knot; they have tried to resolve their disputes by force  but in vain. This is a critical moment in the Arab-Israel peace process  which we in Europe strongly support. We in the Community know that all concerned must seize this opportunity; the tide must be caught. The negotiation of a final settlement based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) will take time yet  will take hard work yet. What is important in the immediate future is for all parties to work towards visible progress  building step on agreed step. Diplomacy is partly a matter of institutions and strengthening them. Speaking as a European on behalf of Europeans  I hope that one day the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will be effective in the prevention of conflict throughout Europe. With the adoption of the Helsinki document the CSCE has begun to give itself the tools to tackle problems by conciliation before they slide into violence  and to manage crises once they develop. That document shows that the CSCE is a regional arrangement according to Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. That makes a crucial link between European and global security. But of course the United Nations is the centre of this thinking  and reform of the United Nations is crucial to its performance. Early this year the Secretary-General made a determined start on administrative reform. I believe that will turn out to be a decisive step. This is being followed up both in the Secretariat and in the vast superstructure of intergovernmental bodies which have grown up over the past 40 years in the economic  social and other fields. We welcome the work of the General Assembly to which I know that you personally  Mr. President  are devoted to rationalize its agenda. All this is welcome; all this has to be carried forward. A summit of the Security Council met last January at the initiative of my Prime Minister to consider next steps. We asked the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the ways in which the United Nations could help tackle the new challenges of which I have spoken. On 17 June  you  Mr. Secretary-General  published your ideas on preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping  peace-making and what you called peace-building. This collection of ideas is going to turn out to be a turning-point in the history of our Organization. You tried to address a need which is not some distance ahead  but which is here and now. I believe you are in the extraordinary position of someone who is being asked to manufacture a vehicle while he is driving that vehicle on the road. It is not easy  but it is necessary. The general debate should be a genuine debate on the ideas advanced in the report. All United Nations bodies  notably the Security Council and the General Assembly  should follow up swiftly in the light of the debate. Preventive diplomacy I have already mentioned. Obviously  it is quicker. It is more helpful to peoples about to be embroiled in conflict than even the most successful peace-keeping operation which comes after the outbreak of violence. It is also less costly in terms of lives and in terms of cash. The Secretary-General should be ready to make full use of his powers under Article 99 of the Charter to draw the attention of the Security Council to any matter which in his opinion may threaten international peace and security. Greater use is already being made of fact-finding missions; we would like to encourage this trend. Preventive deployment of troops might take place to deter aggression or conflict between States  possibly involving deployment to only one side of an international border. Of course there may be difficulties about timing the dispatch of such a force in a given crisis  but we believe this is essentially a sound idea that could be applied case by case. I warmly welcome what President Bush said yesterday on his initiatives to strengthen the peace-keeping work of the United Nations. In the European Community we want to follow up the idea of preventive deployment in the event of an internal crisis  where the Government concerned requests help  with humanitarian assistance or conciliation. No two cases would be the same. There would need to be careful discussions with Governments and the parties concerned before the international community could usefully deploy monitors. Recognizing that  the European Community and its member States have already decided in principle to send civilian monitoring missions to States which want them where this could avert a crisis and possible bloodshed. In South Africa  for example  with the agreement of all the parties  established during a recent visit of the troika  the United Nations will be joined by the European Community and by the Commonwealth in sending observers to reinforce the national peace accords there. Of course  part of this prevention of conflict must involve prevention of the proliferation of armaments  especially weapons of mass destruction. We welcome the agreement on a global convention on chemical weapons. This is a step towards a safer and more secure world. We recognize that peace-making brings pain to some. Bringing pressure -even peaceful pressure  say  of sanctions on warring parties  means sacrifice for innocent third parties. We understand the economic difficulties often caused to third parties by the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII. Countries which need balance-of-payments help  countries which may also at the same time be carrying out prudent adjustment programmes  can be badly affected. The international financial organizations are in the best position to assess and then take into account the effects of United Nations mandatory sanctions when the;_' design support packages for the countries concerned. The Secretary-General's report contains a number of proposals for Member States to earmark forces for enforcement action and for peace-keeping. All 12 States members of the European Community have responded to his questionnaire on this and all Members of the United Nations should  we believe  keep it under regular review. Then there is money  financial contributions. The Secretary-General rightly  continuously underlines the importance of financial as well as military contributions to peace-keeping. The figures speak for themselves. The 12 States members of the European Community are supposed  under the rules  to contribute one third of the cost of peace-keeping operations financed through assessed contributions. At the end of August we  the Twelve  had in fact given not 33 per cent but over 40 per cent of total contributions actually collected so far for the various new operations launched or expanded since the end of the last session of the General Assembly. Those European Community member States  of which mine is one  joining in the new operation in Bosnia  will bear all their own costs. We believe we are doing our bit so far as this is concerned in Europe  and look to others to do the same. The Secretary-General is quite right: the financial problems of the United Nations must not be allowed to slide  must not be allowed to fester. We support the proposed peace-keeping reserve fund  subject to negotiation on the detail  and we believe the General Assembly must follow this up. The role of the United Nations does not stop once a conflict is over. That is why the Secretary-General's study entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" rightly looks at how we can build peace after a conflict. Take El Salvador  an illustration that has already been used by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Korea. The promotion of free elections and democratic institutions is a key part of such peace-building  and so  to take a very different example  is de-mining. Is it not a sad commentary on the state of the world that the removal of mines in the aftermath of conflict has to be high on our agenda  whether in Cambodia  northern Somalia or Angola? But we of the European Community welcome the emphasis the Secretary-General gives to human rights  democracy and development. Perhaps during the cold war some of us tended to concentrate exclusively  or almost exclusively  on abuses of human rights in the Soviet bloc. Elsewhere there was lip-service when there should have been action. But all people are entitled to full human rights. We want the World Conference on Human Rights at Vienna in June 1993 to take real steps in that direction. We warmly welcome as part of that effort what we see as the tide of political reform now flowing in the continent of Africa. We are helping to promote good government and sound human rights and electoral practices. Both at the national and the Community level  we have already shown that we are ready to meet requests for help in election monitoring  notably in Ethiopia  the Congo and  later this year  in Kenya and Ghana  and also in the inter-parliamentary work going on in Namibia. But of course in the longer term collective security can be undermined by deeper economic and social forces  such as poverty and environmental degradation. Relief must be followed by recovery or else the countries afflicted will be overwhelmed by despair. Is that not what we see in Somalia? This appalling tragedy is a warning of what could happen elsewhere  of what could become widespread  because Somalia is just the most extreme form of a problem now affecting large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. I say this all the more strongly because at the beginning of this month I led a European Community Troika visit to Mogadishu. What we saw there is what many colleagues have spoken of  and I echo their voices. We saw the disintegration of a society. We marked the absence of all legitimate authority. We witnessed the collapse of a State and of all services connected with a State. Instead of order  instead of law  teenage gangsters roam the streets  toting their Kalashnikovs and offering protection at a price. Instead of a distribution system  whether capitalist or socialist  there is blackmail and looting. Against that background we saw the new humanitarian relief arrangements being put into place by Mr. Eliasson and many other devoted people. We saw how the United Nations has to work naturally  intimately and without rivalry with non-governmental organizations. We saw how urgently the Somalis need a reconstruction of civil authority. We fully support Ambassador Sahnoun's efforts in Mogadishu  in Somalia. He is an outstanding civil servant on behalf of us all. Last month the Security Council rightly voted to strengthen the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) so that its security units will be better able to distribute aid. Among the States Members of the European Community  Belgium  with the support of all of us  plans a substantial contribution to that security. Of course not all disasters are man-made  though it looks as if an increasing proportion are. There is the drought in the Horn of Africa and southern Africa  which will require a major international effort over the coming year. For the first time  over the last two or three years  the environment has become a priority for all countries. I have to say that the road from Rio de  Janeiro may be harder than to the road to it. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio attracted the world's leaders  the world's media and the world's imagination. But sustainable development has to stay at the top of the international agenda. That is why  immediately after his return from Rio de Janeiro  Prime Minister Major proposed an eight-point follow-up plan picking up the key elements agreed upon at Rio de Janeiro. That initiative was broadly endorsed at our European Council in Lisbon and at the Economic Summit in Munich. The Sustainable Development Commission  which is to be set up by the General Assembly  will be crucial to the follow-up. The Assembly must create an effective instrument to ensure that the impetus built up at Rio is not dissipated and lost. To conclude  for the medium and long term we need to turn hope into reality. In the short term  time after time  in place after place  we must bring hope to what is already a grim reality. The legacy of the cold war is a mixed one. In facing it  the international community must be realistic  because history cannot be denied  cannot be uprooted. The solving of problems which have their roots deep in the centuries is a slow  frustrating business. After the brief gleam of optimism in 1989 and 1990  when all seemed easy  we are now more realistic. Progress towards a more decent  orderly world will never be without effort. Our best hope is to take two steps forward for each step back. Even that imperfect progress will require the rapid strengthening of our institutions and in particular of the family of institutions called the United Nations - not essentially by more conferences and more speeches  but by the practical effort which the United Nations  under the guidance of the  Secretary-General  mounts today in Somalia  Yugoslavia  Cambodia and countless other troubled places. The trucks of our agencies  painted white  and the blue berets of our United Nations contingents do not bring magic or instant happiness  but they bring a glimmer of hope where till then there may have been despair. In the effort of bringing hope  in the short term and in the longer term  the European Community and its member States will take a persistent  energetic and worthy part. "
"59",2559,"GEO",47,1992,"One does not usually say anything personal from this podium. I would submit  however  that my position does allow me to depart from this role. Exactly two years ago  I finished my address here and left this very podium for what I thought was the last time. Yes  I foresaw my resignation from the post of Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union  as I also foresaw menacing changes coming. Before coming here again I reread that address. The ideas that inspired it are  I think  still valid today. They helped me make a forecast that has been borne out by current events. I said then that all the peoples of the Soviet Union were entering the political arena and reassuming their age-old national names.  All of them  including my country  are being dogged by the merciless onslaught of the economic crisis  which I also spoke about in my appeal to the international community to set up an international mechanism capable of mitigating its adverse effects. I said then that after the end of the cold war new and sinister figures would appear on the world political scene  and that the breakdown of attempts to take the road to democracy would give rise to chaos and new dictatorial regimes. I followed my prediction about the threat of new armed conflicts emerging  of mass hostage-taking and the spread of terrorism with the conclusion that regional structures security structures - operating under United Nations auspices must be set up. Even that long ago  two years  I keenly felt the need to really think in terms of doctrine about the new realities of the contemporary world  to re-examine the old principles of our interrelationships  in both the inter-and intra-State areas  and to work out new ones. When I spoke then I was speaking as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of a great Power. Now I am speaking as the representative of a country that is microscopic in comparison. However  the dramatic change in scale does not reduce the size of the problems. In that tiny part of Earth called Georgia  which history has nailed to the geopolitical cross  have converged  in a manner that passes understanding  all the woes and contradictions that the Empire fed into its genetic code and constantly generated  and which continue to rack us even now that the Empire is dead. Everything I thought and spoke of  foresaw and predicted has befallen Georgia  my country. And there was no need for clairvoyance  either; all you needed was to know the system you were dealing with. One of the greats once said that predicting important events in the future was no more difficult than successfully guessing the past: if past events leave traces  then  logically  future events must have roots. The system was doomed. In August 1991  there was an attempt to save it using its own typical methods: conspiracy  flouted laws  the use of force. I had on many occasions warned about the possibility of a coup and totalitarian revanchism. If the necessary conclusions had been drawn from these words of warning  then we would have been dealing not with the chaotic collapse of a huge Power  but with relatively painless and controllable transitions to a new status quo and to the formation of new States. The swiftness of the death throes and the speed of the disintegration took the world community by surprise. It was caught off guard  and is now seeing how new offshoots of violence  new offshoots of catastrophe  are sprouting from the exposed rootstock. Georgia will serve as a typical example. Here we have deep socio-economic crisis. Here the fall of the Empire was attended by the rise of a dictatorial regime. Here several internal conflicts were provoked  and separatism threatens to break up a small country and splinter its historic territory into dwarf States. Here subversion  terrorism and mass hostage-taking rule. And  finally  here as nowhere else is the danger so great that the existing internal conflicts will merge with the ones in neighbouring States and grow into regional or even continental wars fought along national or religious lines. I would recall that  like some other countries  Georgia was incorporated into the Soviet Union by military force. That force was inspired by an ideology that placed the interests of the class struggle far above common human goals and national values. In the light of this ideology  the integrity of territories and borders that had been shaped over time was of no significance: they were redrawn and parcelled out again to follow the lines on the battlefield of proletarian internationalism. The State  political  administrative and territorial structure so formed was such that it contained within itself the germs of dissatisfaction  smouldering enmity and potential conflict within republics and between them. Time bombs were planted for our futures. While the power of ideology and repressive compulsion kept this heterogeneous community together  the bombs lay idle. As soon as that power was removed  they went off  and today a blast front of enormous power is destroying whole States. Georgia too is threatened. The history of Georgia's struggle for statehood spans many centuries. For many centuries  this struggle went together with the formation of a distinctive national culture and the defence of its faith and language. In the year 337 AD  Christianity  as the State religion  blessed the country's impulse towards unity within its own common borders. Having become a powerful State in Western Asia by the eleventh and twelfth centuries  Georgia established cultural centres both within its own borders and in various other States beyond. My portrait of Georgia would not be complete if I missed out one very important feature: from time immemorial  as part of the flow of peoples  ideas and cultures  Georgia has upheld racial and religious tolerance as a basic tenet of its way of life. Forced to do battle with the most powerful foreign adversaries  Georgia did not suffer from either xenophobia or religious fanaticism. In its capital city  Tbilisi  within an area of one square kilometre  one can see a Georgian Orthodox church  an Armenian Gregorian cathedral  a mosque  a synagogue and a Lutheran church. Christian from the fourth century on  Georgia has also seen Islam take root in some of its historically important provinces. And never was there enmity or discord between them  nor was anyone denied the right to live according to his or her own beliefs or traditions. Unfortunately for all of us  the slings and arrows of history brought down this unity  from within as well as from outside  and something similar is happening now. I consider it my duty to draw your attention to the Caucasus region  as  here and now  a new and serious hotbed of interethnic  regional and international tension is emerging. This new source of Shockwaves is within the mainstream of contemporary geopolitical trends: the displacement of a global confrontation onto regional levels. This displacement has taken the form of large-scale armed conflicts  such as the ones we are seeing in some countries of Europe  around the Dniestr  at home in Georgia and in Transcaucasia  and in Central Asia. This vacuum of ideas abhors its own emptiness. We should have started thinking about events in the huge expanse from Bosnia to Tajikistan  including the Caucasus  and studying them  long ago  to find out the whys and wherefores. Sound politicians and statesmen as well as ordinary people  whether Christian or Muslim  who live in this vast area or elsewhere have a duty to halt this most dangerous process. The threat of large-scale conflicts kindled and enflamed by fundamentalism of whatever kind is too serious to be ignored. And the danger is that much greater when fanaticism is exploited by fundamentalists of a Bolshevist stripe. Although they have various causes  the new conflicts do have some features in common  particularly the following: they all began and are developing against a background in which a number of factors are operating either simultaneously or partially. These are an ethnic patchwork; a variety of religions and denominations; socio-economic inequality; and a troubled historical and political past. In the case of the Caucasus  these factors which are common to all the regions in question must be added to the specificity of its geopolitical situation. At the meeting point of powerful geopolitical forces  it has from time immemorial served as a buffer zone between South and North  Christianity and Islam  as an arena in which they played out their aspirations and interests. The disintegration of the Soviet Union has left an opening for new rivalries to appear. Because of their political  economic and military weakness  the new States of the Caucasus are not able to fill this vacuum and establish reliable safeguards for their own security. External forces apart  various internal groupings are trying to turn the vacuum to their own advantage under the cover of nationalistic  pseudopatriotic  separatist  and  most recently  even religious guises with their own  self-serving political agendas. The activities of the so-called Confederation of the Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus  which has flouted the sovereignty  the territorial integrity and the borders of the Republic of Georgia  have made this clear in one way or another. Against the will of the people of the northern Caucasus and their legally elected governments  this illegal  in essence openly terrorist   militarized organization  serving no State  has called for any means to be used  including mass terror; has declared our country  and its capital city  a disaster zone; and has been sending mercenaries and terrorist killers  in the guise of volunteers  across our frontiers. Under our very eyes  the flames of war are rising  and are even now threatening to engulf not only Georgia alone. Right before our eyes a new war is blazing up  threatening not just Georgia. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: in comparison with the other ""hot spots"" of the post-communist world  the risk of conflict in the Caucasus is higher  and the Caucasus therefore endangers international peace and security more. Georgia is at the very centre of where the problems of the Caucasus meet. Yet again  as so often before in our history  Georgia's fate  its statehood and its very existence are marked on the map. Faced with the complex interactions of internal and external forces  we are striving to implement an active  balanced policy. Within the country  our policy is one of democratic transformation  national reconciliation and peaceful settlement of conflicts  while externally it is one of the development of friendly relationships with all the countries in the region and cooperation with the world community. We are grateful to our neighbours through history: to Turkey  with which we have concluded a friendship treaty; and to Iran  with which we are developing friendly contacts  to the mutual benefit of both countries. Our centuries-long links with the peoples of Transcaucasia  Armenia and Azerbaijan  and with the republics of the Northern Caucasus and with Ukraine  give us an excellent foundation for close cooperation in the interest of our countries. Of particular importance to us and not to us alone are our relations with Russia. Russia has assisted us in setting up machinery to settle the Georgian-Ossetian conflict. Twice now Russia has borne witness to the principle of the territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of our State  and has joined in the process of achieving a peaceful settlement in another conflict  in Abkhazia. A stable  prosperous and democratic Russia is a factor on a global scale and global in significance. A threat to Russia from the forces of totalitarian revanchism is a threat to us all. In the conspiracy against Georgia which is now coming out into the open  Russia's red-brown reactionaries are standing shoulder to shoulder with the extreme fundamentalists  home-grown fascists and separatists. The world must know about this  and the world has a duty to help reinforce a stable  democratic Russia and  by so doing  help both us and its own self. Those are the facts of our political life today. Those facts are why we keep trying to achieve the establishment of a Transcaucasian mechanism for consultation and agreement. We propose that we should begin to establish a system of collective security in the Black Sea-Caucasus region  and  in this regard  we very much appreciate Turkey's initiatives. We support the new institutions of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  whose goal is conflict prevention and the protection of the rights of national minorities. Our doors are wide open to fact-finding missions from European or world organizations.  However  today this is not enough. The end of the cold war has put the need to develop a more effective system of global security on the agenda. The pace of events is outstripping us; the European process is falling behind  and has been very late with its response to the challenges of a time of transformations. There has been a significant lag too in the United Nations reaction to the major changes in various regions of the world  with the changes in the former Soviet Union in the forefront. We welcome the bold initiatives of the Secretary-General aimed at making the Organization more dynamic and capable of responding quickly to the needs of the day. His report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) quite rightly raises the question of the United Nations taking a multi-tiered approach to the problems of the modern world. It is a good thing that an authoritative  independent commission has been set up to examine the role of the Organization under current conditions. There is no need to fear reforms when reforms are so necessary  especially  in our view  in the two interrelated fields of peace-keeping and nation-building in the newly independent States. I have a number of suggestions to make about these two fields. My first suggestion concerns the establishment of a global monitoring network for the monitoring  prevention and settlement of internal conflicts. Special United Nations observers at ""hot spots"" and regional bureaux  missions and information centres would help us obtain a clear picture of events and develop specific responses. The machinery for doing this should be based right in the regions where conflict is occurring; in our example  in the Caucasus it could be based on the United Nations office in Tbilisi. We would also suggest expanding the mandate of the CSCE High Commissioner for national minorities so that  if required  he could inform the Secretary-General and our Organization's Commission on Human Rights. The most important thing is that this should be got off the ground as quickly as possible. Similar institutions with the same mandates could be established within other regional organizations too. The United Nations needs a special body to collect and process information on potential ethnic conflicts and to draw conclusions and issue recommendations based upon it. Another of its functions would be to forecast conflict situations at an early stage in their gestation. The International Court too could be brought in to consider conflicts. The role and the capabilities of the Security Council must be looked at anew. We have more than once raised the issue of whether the Military Staff Committee should not become more actively involved. Now that the cold war is over but the number of ""hot spots"" is burgeoning  the Security Council cannot do without this  or another similar structure  if it is to carry out its function under the Charter in full measure. It must be made binding on the States Members of the United Nations to inform the Security Council of imminent conflicts. Failure to comply must call down sanctions. We commit ourselves to sending the United Nations and its Security Council annual reports on the state of affairs in the areas of the protection of human rights and national minorities  and on crisis situations which could lead to serious complications within the country or the region. This problem has yet another facet: information. Rivalry spills over into the newspapers and on the airwaves  and the side with the best technology  the most money and the widest access to the media and to media  people wins. Public opinion becomes one-sided and unfounded  but this again is half the battle. The worst thing is that this guerrilla warfare in the media nourishes the soil of conflicts and makes them more difficult to settle. We see a possible way out of this by establishing centres to disseminate objective information under the auspices of the international organizations. My second suggestion concerns the problem of refugees. Ethnic conflicts have increased their number manyfold: no one now knows exactly how many there are. No one knows what resources are needed to help them and what we should start doing first to rule out the possibility of fresh conflicts after they return home. Here too a system of observers is needed  as is an aid organization larger in scale than what we have now and capable not only of providing material support but of making the whole process more manageable. In our view  the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees needs root-and-branch reform. My third suggestion is that there should be general and comprehensive control over the proliferation of arms. The clans of ethnic mafiosi spawned under the totalitarian system are accumulating the colossal sums needed to acquire weapons and to suborn soldiers into taking part in hostilities and passing out materiel to the irregulars on the quiet. The national security forces and law-enforcement agencies in the young independent States are being overwhelmed by this epidemic of out-of-control arms races. What we need are international rapid deployment forces a sort of Interpol of Blue Helmets -an independent disarmament monitoring agency and the introduction of regional arms registers. My fourth suggestion is for United Nations rapid deployment forces in the field of international legal thought and theoretical and doctrinal developments. The traditional system of legal guidelines is lagging hopelessly far behind the onrush of geopolitical changes. The world is facing arbitrary and one-sided interpretations of a whole range of internationally recognized principles. Arbitrary  wild-cat declarations of sovereignty have led in practice to encroachments on the territorial integrity of States and on the inviolability of their borders  and to large population groups being turned into second-class citizens; it has also caused and will cause many bloody conflicts. Unfortunately  separatism and extremism  when combined  are the ruin not just of States but of legal systems too. The top dogs of the separatist movements are bending the rules so far they are turning them into caricatures. If extremist separatism is not stopped  what awaits is a world splintered and in collapse  with the anarchy and chaos lasting into the twenty-first century. On no account can some principles be made absolute at the expense of others. It is morally wrong for one group to go for self-determination as if they do not notice that for centuries  side-by-side with them  on the same land  there have been peoples living  peoples that cannot physically be removed. This is the problem to beat all problems of today's world. Every aspiration  every claim  every norm and category should be measured in terms of the human scale of politics  whose priorities are the equality of the rights of each citizen  of everybody  regardless of nationality  ethnicity  language or religion. In the light of this approach  we see that not only do national minorities need to have their rights protected  but so do the citizens of the majority  however paradoxical that may sound. Otherwise  we may face an updated form of apartheid and ethnic dictatorship  like we have in the conflict zone of Abkhazia  where the minority has managed to impose its will on the majority. How could this have come about? What we have here is a classic example of self-interested bending of the law. Thanks to a discriminatory electoral law  electors of a single nationality  comprising no more than 18 per cent of the population  send more deputies to the parliament of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic than the electors in another that makes up more than half the population there  and the rights of the other national groups are being trampled on too: it takes only a third as many votes to elect one Abkhazi deputy as it does to elect a Georgian  a Russian  an Armenian and so on. At the end of the day  this kind of legal extremism leads to bitter confrontation. The governing elite  reflecting as it does the mood of the extremist wing of the minority  is ruling by Draconian diktat and is going so far as to wrest territory that has been Georgia's from time immemorial away from it. Separatism is immune to dialogue and compromise: this we know from our own experience. Separatism does not want talks  rejects the methods of rational politics and even balks at implementing what it has agreed. It switches meanings  calling aggression and occupation ""movement of military sub-units within our own territory"". How can this be? And in Georgia  on Georgian soil  where Georgians and Abkhazis have lived  still live and will go on living together? In the near future the General Assembly will consider a draft declaration on the rights of national minorities. We are going to support it  as we supported the corresponding resolutions of the CSCE. However  I wish to say once again that any instrument of this kind must also contain an article on minorities' share of the responsibility for maintaining stability and peace in the territory where they live. It is also time to develop more precise criteria for which legal subjects are entitled to self-determination  and to introduce a practice of independent  expert examination of the facts involved in the arbitrary interpretation and exercise of this right. My fifth suggestion concerns the fact that none of the above will work properly unless more effective machinery for supporting the new democracies economically is set up. My saying so does not detract from our gratitude to the European and world financial institutions; it is thanks to them that we are still alive. However  facts are facts: the economies of the republics of the former Union  are on the brink of catastrophe. The drop in production by almost a third  in Georgia's case  the lack of fuel and raw materials and the catastrophic increases in prices for them  the loss of traditional suppliers and markets and imminent mass unemployment set a limit to democratic transformations. I say to you most emphatically: the appalling economic crisis in the republics of the former Union will send shock waves throughout the world. If this goes on  a social explosion of enormous force is inevitable. A change in values away from democracy to those of the power of the firm hand is inevitable. And for this the world will have a higher price to pay than it would have to pay now. Let us think how we can prevent this  let us think what sort of system of reliable international economic insurance we can try to set up. It is quite clear that this point must be taken into account in the international organizations  particularly the United Nations: it is difficult to talk about world economic stability and a single world zone of security if the world's leading Powers do not take part. The Security Council absolutely must exert real influence on the state of affairs. I used to come out against increasing the number of permanent members. Now that the Soviet Union has fallen apart and the balance of power has shifted  we need to concern ourselves with finding the best composition of permanent members to increase the degree of effect that the Security Council can have on the world economic process  and not just on the economic process. The role of economic giants such as Germany and Japan will have to be rethought. I would mention in passing that the forecasts concerning certain pretensions on the part of the United States of America to some kind of special role in the new circumstances that would allow it to impose its will on the world have not proved to be accurate what I have in mind here is the principal  fundamental trend. The balanced foreign policy of this great country has not run counter to the interests of other States and  in the final analysis  has helped maintain the balance in the interests of peace and stability. We would like to hope that the United States will go on being a guarantee of peace  order and equilibrium in the new  extremely complex conditions and in the process of building the new world order. The United Nations cannot stand idly by when it comes to material support for the new democracies. Here too we need rapid deployment forces  economic ones this time. The United Nations is quite within its powers to coordinate the activities of the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund and other regional and international institutions more effectively and on a new basis in order to give fuller support for the success of the economic reforms in the new States that have begun that most important process  the building of democratic societies. My sixth suggestion is that we are quite simply obliged to introduce into the body of international law an instrument concerning the personal responsibility of individuals who incite mass disorders  political brutality  hostage-taking  terrorist acts or any kind of blockade  whether economic or political. Our troubled times have brought these people forth. The pygmies are in revolt against humankind. This has all happened before  but the world has never before had to face a wave of ""Messiahs"" wanting to consolidate their power on the back of the sufferings of their own people on the scale it is facing them now. Lilliputians tying down Gullivers that is the reality in many countries  including my own. I now come to my seventh and last suggestion. Everything I have said so far attests to the fact that our common responsibility for peace and security requires us to harmonize and coordinate our common efforts in the political  economic  military  financial and ecological fields. These fields should be managed on four interdependent and interrelated levels: the intra-State  the regional  the supraregional and the worldwide. The first level will not become established unless our Organization manages to find ways to support the making of the new democratic States. The second will be possible if there is agreement on an identity or a proximity of interests on the part of the States involved in regional cooperation. Organizations such as the CSCE  the Organization of African Unity  the Organization of American States and an alliance of the countries of the Black Sea basin could form the basis for the third level. The fourth level involves establishing a coordinating system for interactions on a world scale  in which the principal coordinator would be the United Nations and its institutions. This rostrum has always seemed very high to me. I used to feel how high it was even when the the world was ready to hang on the every word of the representative of a huge and mighty Power  whatever that word might be. That is the privilege of the powerful  but I did use to try to make our words sound like a message of good will rather than of malign force. Now that I am speaking on behalf of a small and weak country  I feel how much higher this rostrum has grown and what a lifeline it is for my homeland. There was a considerable element of risk involved in my present ascent of this rostrum: things are very bad indeed back home. The bombshells of hatred are exploding all too often there. Those shells are aimed to destroy our policy of democratically establishing and constructing an honest  just State open to the world. Such explosions are all the more likely today  in the run-up to parliamentary elections in which the people of the Republic of Georgia must either endorse or reject our policy of democracy and freedom. Nevertheless  I have come so that Georgia does not lose what is now its only chance to tell the world about its hopes and aspirations  to confirm the truth and refute the lie. I have come so that I can once again reaffirm my commitment to the word we gave the world community. What of it that the scale has diminished and the horizons have closed in? I am thinking  speaking and acting in accordance with the same principles and norms I have stood up for here for all these years past. Finally and this will be my last personal confession I have missed your company very  very much. I have gone over the time-limit  but the way things are is that the smaller the size and scale of a State  the more time it needs. I thank you for hearing me out. "
"60",2605,"GHA",47,1992,"It is a great pleasure and privilege for me to congratulate you. Sir  in the name of the Ghana delegation  on the honour that the Assembly has conferred on you by electing you to preside over the affairs of its forty-seventh regular session. The cordial relations that exist between our two countries give us added pleasure in your presidency. We pledge you our support and cooperation during your tenure as President of the most representative organ of our United Nations. Permit me to express our gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for the excellence that marked his stewardship. He tackled his assignment with a steadfast sense of commitment  fully charged with a deep awareness of the historic role that the General Assembly must continue to play in the expanding importance of our Organization. We salute the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his energetic leadership. Within the short period since his assumption of office he has demonstrated his remarkable skills as an administrator and as an accomplished diplomat. We renew our pledge to support him in his difficult and delicate task. My delegation would also like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to the new Member States  whose presence among us further enhances the universality of our Organization. It was with deep regret and sorrow that we learned of the crash of a Nigerian military aircraft and of a Pakistan International Airlines aircraft  with such loss of life. Preliminary information indicates that among the 163 officers reported dead in the crash of the Nigerian military aircraft were officers from other West African States  including Ghana. We share in the grief at such a tragic loss. Our condolences go to the bereaved families of these gallant men  who died in the course of service to our subregion. We also wish to convey through you. Sir  to the people and Government of Pakistan our heartfelt condolences on their tragic bereavement. Once again we  the representatives of the Governments and peoples of the United Nations  have assembled here to combine our efforts for the promotion of peace and prosperity for all our peoples. The search for peace is part of the eternal guest of humanity for a relationship in society that  though recognizing differences and conflicts of interests  strives for their resolution without resort to means that could destroy humanity itself. Twice in recent world history this search has engulfed us in wars. Regrettably  the period after the Second World War turned the quest into confrontation and competition marked by unrestrained and costly acquisition of deadly arsenals  of war on the untenable assumption that peace could be guaranteed only by the highest level of preparedness for war. This untenable policy of deterrence overshadowed the real causes of tension in society factors that  in the words of the Charter  have twice ""brought untold sorrow to mankind"" and are at the root of conflicts that have sent our Blue Helmets to the continents of Africa  America  Asia and Europe. The world now stands on the ashes of the cold war  celebrating the end of that war. Yet the harsh reality of our world  divided as it is between the rich and the poor  the strong and the weak  has not been obliterated by the ending of the cold war nor by the emerging new world order  the contours of which are far from clear. In this uncertain new world order  we are told that history must resume. Which history? Is it the history at whose hands vast areas of our globe suffered so much  and from whose predatory effects we have yet to fully recover as nations? Or is it the history that launched many of us into freedom and independence? Juxtaposed with the challenge of the reality of our world is a historic and unparalleled opportunity to construct peace  not as an alternative to war  but as the prerequisite for social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom  anchored in faith  in true human rights  and in human dignity and equality. In the grim reality of our world  which has not been wiped away by the end of the cold war  we would hear the anguished cries of the more than 30 000 children who will die today  largely from preventable intestinal disorders; of the 2 million children who will die this year from vaccine-preventable illnesses; and of the 5 million to 6 million people who will die this year from diseases that the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) says could almost certainly be prevented by the development of new vaccines. Four million people will die by the end of this year  their pleas and those of their nations for help to cure them of diarrhea ailments ignored. We would also see the plight of the 1.3 billion human beings with no access to safe drinking water and the 2.3 billion people world-wide who have no access to sanitation services. We would see the 135 million human beings who live in areas afflicted with desert conditions  particularly in Africa  where almost nothing grows. We would also see that in that part of the world one out of every five children dies at birth. For those who survive life expectancy ranges from 42 to 63. During their short span on Earth many of these relatively lucky ones will be uprooted from their homes by poverty  drought and natural disasters  all compounded at times by rivalries that are ethnic in character but emanate largely from quarrels over scarce resources. These are but a few of the graphic and dehumanizing manifestations that only partly reflect the world reality in which 70 per cent of the world's income is produced and consumed by 15 per cent of the world's population located in the industrialized countries. The World Bank forecasts that there will be no significant upturn in this lopsided relationship until 1995 or well beyond. And the international community is not unaware of the factors that have conspired to frustrate the efforts of developing countries. Falling commodity prices  rising protectionism  huge agricultural subsidies  various price support mechanisms and suffocating debt-servicing may now sound like repetitive platitudes in some ears. But they are the realities that have undermined the gallant efforts of the developing countries. In Africa overall economic output continues to revolve around 3 per cent still lagging behind the population growth. The impact on investment and growth of the structural reform programmes  which many African countries continue to undertake  remains disappointing. Debt relief through rescheduling has proved to be of little real benefit to African countries  which continue to part with $10 billion a year on debt servicing alone an expenditure that is several times higher than the expenditure on health and education put together. Prospects that such a dehydrating financial outflow would be contained by increased aid infusion have proved illusory. In its annual report. Development Cooperation 1991  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has confirmed  though indirectly  the fears of the international community that the preoccupation with developments in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union would aggravate the marginalization of Africa. According to the OECD  not only did aid from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to sub-Saharan Africa almost fall to zero  but also aid disbursements to the same area from other countries remained stagnant. In contrast  the OECD estimated that pledges from its members in November 1991 to Eastern Europe amounted to $45 billion as compared with its annual official commitments to Africa of about $34 billion. Furthermore  at their meeting in Munich in July this year  the Group of Seven industrialized countries endorsed a package of financial assistance worth $24 billion to the Russian Federation alone. It is of little wonder  then  that the World Bank  in its report entitled African External Finance in the 1990s  foresees for sub-Saharan Africa a financial shortfall ranging from $1 billion to $7 billion by 1995. It is against this discouraging backdrop that my Government supports not only the call for the write-off of debts by official creditors and commercial banks  as well as by multilateral institutions  but also the convening of the proposed international conference on the financing of development  which assumes a new urgency in the face of these facts. The end of the cold war has not brought peace to the world either. It is true that the danger of nuclear holocaust has now receded into a very remote possibility. But the world has not become any safer. In its ""Jakarta Message: A Call for Collective Action and the Democratization of International Relations""  the Non-Aligned Movement has aptly observed ""Simmering disputes  violent conflicts  aggression and foreign occupation -interference in the internal affairs of States  policies of hegemony and domination  ethnic strife  religious intolerance  new forms of racism and narrowly conceived nationalism are major and dangerous obstacles to harmonious coexistence among States and peoples and have even led to the disintegration of States and societies"".  The disintegration and descent of Yugoslavia into a region of instability  war  strife and misery is a source of concern to the people and the Government of Ghana. Unrestrained nationalism that is projected as an expression of the much-cherished principle of self-determination and the use of force for the homogenization of populations are as unacceptable and as warped as they are incapable of promoting peace in an ever-increasingly interdependent world. Underlying such policies is the obnoxious element of racial intolerance  which inexorably leads to racism and racial discrimination. Ethnic homogeneity cannot  and should not  be a prerequisite for coexistence in a civic society. Fundamental human rights  human dignity and equality can be meaningful for man only in a society that respects the worth of the human person  irrespective of colour  race  ethnic origin  creed or sex. We condemn the notion of ""ethnic cleansing"" in the strongest terms possible  just as the world has rejected and condemned every thought and manifestation of racial superiority. In our search for a new world order that emphasizes cooperation rather than confrontation as the means to international peace and security  we have to monitor developments carefully  if only to draw attention to threats to peace. We are  therefore  disturbed by the increasing dangers to peace caused by intolerance  xenophobia  racial and ethnic tensions elsewhere in Europe. The raising of symbols reminiscent of an ignominious chapter of history  the baiting of religious minorities  including the desecration of their tombs and sacred places  as well as racial attacks  constitute inherent threats to peace. While these manifestations may reflect the frustrations of those who stand on the fringes of their societies marginalized  unemployed and neglected the manifestations are none the less unacceptable. We therefore call upon our Organization and individual Member States to redouble efforts in promoting peaceful coexistence through respect for each other's race  colour  ethnicity  religion and sex. My Government is ready to play its full part in this renewed endeavour. While my Government does recognize the complexity of the Middle East crisis  we  nevertheless  regret that the hopes raised by the commendable initiative launched last year by the United States for a lasting peace in the subregion still remain only hopes. We urge all parties to be persistent and cooperative in the search for peace. We also urge the United Nations to be fully involved in the process so as to assure the speedy realization by the Palestinian people of the full restoration of their rights and the attainment of their self-determination in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. The full restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty and territorial integrity was a reaffirmation of basic principles of inter-State relations. The time has now come to bury the hatchet and enter a new era of genuine peace and reconciliation. In that regard  it is our cherished hope that all States will demonstrate respect for the principles of non-aggression  mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. Outstanding issues  such as the question of Kuwaiti prisoners of war  must now be promptly resolved to open the way for Islamic brotherhood  fraternal cooperation and solidarity. Our Organization needs to remind itself that even though the conflict in Liberia has been stopped from exploding into a major subregional crisis  it is far from over. Now that the United Nations  particularly the Security Council  has been able to define a role for itself in the Yugoslav situation  it is imperative that our Organization assume its responsibilities in Liberia. The developing countries of the subregion which have so far borne the weight of the ECOWAS (Economic Commission of West African States) Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) deserve the recognition  the encouragement  and the material and financial support of our Organization. The active involvement of the United Nations is now required to arrest the deteriorating situation  brought about largely by the intransigence of one faction. In our view  the involvement of the United Nations would  furthermore  not only accelerate the peace process  but also facilitate the restoration of peace and security in the entire subregion  enabling its countries to focus their full attention on their economic and social development. The pervasive breakdown of law and order in Somalia which is hampering the peace process and relief efforts also deserves the attention of our Organization. The people and Government of Ghana have heaved a sigh of deep relief that at long last the Security Council has shown appreciation of the serious threat that the Somalia situation poses to the political and economic stability of the subregion and consequently to international peace and security. The Security Council's handling of the Yugoslav situation should encourage it to continue  in a more steadfast manner  its efforts in the search for peace in Somalia. We also call upon the Somali factions currently engaged in senseless fratricide to desist from placing obstacles in the path of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations in their efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the millions of starving Somali people. We all continue to look on as the Government of Sudan seeks a military solution to an essentially political problem in the southern part of the country  thereby resulting in gross abuses of human rights  untold suffering of the people and an unbearable refugee problem for neighbouring States. The humanitarian dimension of this problem now calls for United Nations action. Developments during the year have reminded all of us that determined efforts would be required to complete the total political emancipation of the continent of Africa. We regret the postponement of the referendum which was to have been held in Western Sahara under United Nations supervision to complete its decolonization. We urge the Secretary-General of the United Nations  in cooperation with the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  to settle all questions of voter eligibility  delays in the exchange of prisoners and the repatriation of bona fide Saharawis in order to facilitate the task of the United Nations Mission for the Organization of a Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). The inability of the parties to adhere to the implementation of agreements reached raises questions as to their commitment to the peace process. We take this opportunity to appeal to all parties concerned to cooperate fully with the United Nations and the OAU to bring this chapter of colonial struggle to a close. In South Africa  the international community had hoped that the Convention for a Democratic South Africa would contribute to the introduction of ""profound and irreversible changes"". In anticipation of the establishment of an interim government and firm processes leading to a democratically elected constituent assembly to draw up a constitution for a united  non-racial and democratic South Africa  the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session adopted a series of measures to encourage the racist  regime in its efforts to dismantle apartheid. Recent developments would seem to confirm the view that De Klerk's Government is  on the contrary  pursuing a double agenda in order to perpetuate the obnoxious system of apartheid. Whilst posturing and stating its willingness to negotiate  it seeks ways and means to entrench white supremacy. The Boipatong and Ciskei massacres are disingenuous provocations of the racist regime designed to derail the process towards the establishment of an interim government which would work out a new constitutional framework. The white minority regime and its cohorts stand accused of violence. They instigate and perpetuate violence against unarmed peaceful protesters in an attempt to hold on to a moribund and unjust system and to prevent the march towards a united  democratic  non-racial South Africa. It is becoming clear that the international community relaxed its pressure on the racist regime far too early and without due regard for the warnings of the democratic forces of that country. It should  however  be made clear to the South African Government that the programmed-management approach to the lifting of sanctions is intended as a reaction to measures it would take for the total elimination of apartheid. It should be stressed  in this regard  that even the people-to-people sanctions would be re-imposed if the Government does not abandon its stalling of the peace process. History is littered with instances of situations in which desperation has driven people to actions which have spilled over their narrow confines to pose challenges and threats to others. Many peoples have waged heroic struggles to overthrow the forces of tyranny and exploitation. In spite of the belief that the Second World War was fought to end the threat to international peace and security that a particularly racist ideology posed  the greater threat to the common peace remains an international order that seems bent on denying many of us our fair share of the very fruits of our labour in a truly free and equitable market-place. The world cannot be seen to be encouraging a policy founded on the dangerous notion that it is only through military might that a sovereign State can gain respect and acceptability in the international economic system already dominated by a few. Popular demands for changes in the world order that manifest themselves as conflicts the world over cannot be contained by the dispatch of United Nations peace-keeping forces alone. The people and Government of Ghana salute the Member States of the United Nations  our distinguished Secretary-General and his dedicated staff  and all who have been associated with the sterling successes achieved so far. We share in their pride. But we need to be reminded often of the self-evident truth that the presence of United Nations peace-keepers does not by itself guarantee enduring peace. The harrowing events in Bosnia attest to this. The peace-keeping presence does not even directly contribute to the solution of the underlying problems that give rise to the conflict or threat to peace. The United Nations peace-keeping role should be seen for what it is: an invaluable contribution to containing a conflict and to the search for a lasting political solution. An international order that can be secured only through military presence or intervention is clearly inadequate. It is a rather sad reflection on our search for peace that as of the end of April 1992  close to $3 billion had been assessed on Member States for peace-keeping purposes alone  while the United Nations relatively neglected the economic and social underpinnings of most of these conflicts and those yet to rear their heads. The inability of the United Nations since its creation to respond effectively to our Charter's injunction to combine our efforts to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character deserves serious and careful review now that the cold war has been pronounced over.  The relative inaction by the international community and within the United Nations itself on the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s speaks eloquently of our misplaced emphasis in our efforts regarding the establishment of a new world order. The opportunity presented by the consensus General Assembly resolution 46/151 on the final review and appraisal of the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990  in which the international community accepted the principle of shared responsibility and full partnership with Africa  must be a spur to our good intentions  if the continent of Africa is not to be condemned to a fate worse than that which it has been enduring this last decade and a half. The unseemly wrangling  which turned into disappointment for many  at the summit of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro over the transfer of financial resources and technology to the majority poor  attest to an insufficient appreciation on the part of many of the developed nations that in the final analysis world peace depends on the economic and social well-being of all peoples. The statement that the Security Council adopted at the end of its historic summit on 31 January 1992 represented as the Secretary-General has stated in his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping"" an unprecedented recommitment at the highest political level to the purposes and principles of the Charter. In this document  however  the primacy of economic relations - nay  the necessity for a redefinition of the new world order underpinned by economic  trade  technological and development issues to promote peace sadly received little attention. Preventive diplomacy cannot and should not be limited to efforts  to prevent the outbreak of conflicts. No standing army  however well-equipped and well-garrisoned is a bulwark against underdevelopment  poverty and natural disasters. Preventive diplomacy should also  and even more significantly  be directed at eliminating the factors that contribute to conflicts. In the context of international peace and security it should focus on the establishment of a just world order in which everyone has access to good drinking water  food  shelter  health and education. The first significant steps should be taken within our Organization  the United Nations. The pre-eminent position of the General Assembly in the work of the Organization should be asserted and reconfirmed. The Charter provisions  notably Articles 15 and 24(3)  must be given full meaning and effect. It should be emphasized that the Security Council was not conceived as an executive organ. It is to facilitate decision-making in urgent situations of the eruption of conflicts that the Members of the Organization have conferred on it  under Article 24  the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Above all  the present composition of the Security Council  with the outmoded and obviously undemocratic permanent-five arrangement that reflects the post-Second-World-War situation and its 10 two-year rotative seats for the rest of the world  flies in the face of a global reality in which we are all expected to play our part in maintaining the peace. The creeping tendency on the part of certain nations to see themselves as policy-makers and executors on behalf of the entire United Nations membership through their predominance in the Security Council does not send out welcome signals to the rest of us as equal partners in world affairs. The Security Council  we submit  should be enabled to perform its functions in a more democratic manner to enhance its legitimacy in acting on behalf of the membership of the United Nations in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter. In this regard we welcome the decision of the Non-Aligned Movement at its tenth summit in Jakarta to empanel a working group on the revitalization and restructuring of the United Nations  and hope that the working group will make a positive contribution towards the democratization of the Organization. The people and Government of Ghana retain faith and we wish hereby to reaffirm it in the United Nations to lead the efforts of the international community in the establishment of a truly new order. We believe that the United Nations remains the only hope of mankind for peace and prosperity. Together we must resist the temptation to see some Member States as more equal than others; to see some Member States as leaders  with all others as mere followers. For it is through the efforts of all Members  large and small  acting in concert through our United Nations that we can craft and ensure a new world order that is just and equitable and reflects the diversity of mankind  an order in which all nations have a legitimate share and interest as equals. The people and Government of Ghana rededicate themselves to this pursuit. "
"61",2651,"GIN",47,1992,"Exactly 34 years ago today Guinea attained independence. On this anniversary I am very happy to convey to you. Sir  the warm greetings of the people of Guinea  its Government and its President  General Lansana Conte. Beyond its being simply a matter of tradition  I find it a very pleasant duty to congratulate the President on his election. I am convinced that our work will produce tangible -results  thanks to his personal experience and the international prestige of his country. I also wish to express to our President's predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  with whom my delegation had the good fortune to cooperate within the Bureau of the forty-sixth session  our appreciation for the competence and dedication with which he conducted the work of that session. Mr. Perez de Cuellar also earned the high esteem of my Government for having marked his two consecutive terms of office with effectiveness and consensus. Similarly  I pay tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  for his dynamism and the many initiatives he has taken since assuming office. His report ""An Agenda for Peace"" is a source of valuable inspiration in the maintenance and strengthening of international peace. The preventive diplomacy he advocates in it should have the support of the international community. The Guinean Government warmly welcomes the admission of new Member States  confirming once again the universality of our Organization's principles. Many events have occurred since our last session. Mankind is living through an age of hope  but also one of uncertainty. True  many promises are being made  but there does not appear to be a sufficient awareness of dangers. Indeed  the new world architecture is taking shape against a backdrop of persistent poverty and misery in the South  in contrast to the general well-being in the North. The international landscape still contains dark zones of actual and potential conflict. The transition towards the emerging order is creating for the countries of Eastern Europe  Asia  Africa and South America problems whose solution will require sacrifice  farsightedness and solidarity from the international community. Along with the political stakes  which are of crucial importance  there are no-less-important economic and social challenges. Clearly  poverty is undermining the fabric of States  creating profound imbalances in the developing countries and threatening the very foundation of human rights. And the first human right  the one on which all the others depend  is the right to development. Nor can there be development without a guarantee of sources of income derived from basic commodities  prices for which  unfortunately  are not within the control of developing countries. This disturbing situation represents a real threat to the North as well  for it is already one of the causes of the strong wave of migration from the South in search of prosperity. This is compounded by the external indebtedness of the third world countries. Payments for debt servicing  which increase exponentially  are in the final analysis an unbearable burden on economies already severely tried by the imbalances in the world economic order and by natural disasters. Many solutions have been advanced  but the international community must finally give priority to the growth and development of the poor countries must  in other words  build on the ruins of the old East-West order a new order based on more dynamic and more innovative North-South relations. Such a system could take into account  inter alia  free access for export products from the South to markets in the North and a growth in public aid to development and investments. It has been recognized that improving the situation in Africa necessarily involves economic reforms  the sound management of public affairs and popular participation in development. In this connection  most of the countries of Africa have undertaken deep political  economic and social reforms. But the efforts undertaken on the national  subregional and regional levels have not  unfortunately  enjoyed the expected international support. The United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990  which gave rise to so much hope  has not produced the desired results. Capital flows from North to South have been negative in relation to the flow of resources from South to North. Nevertheless  my delegation welcomes the adoption by the United Nations of the New Agenda for African Development in the 1990s  which will  I hope  enhance the impact of United Nations action in the economic and social development of the continent. For Africa  one thing is clear: recovery and the diversification of economic activities require subregional and regional integration. In this connection  the establishment of the African Economic Community will enable the continent to benefit from the complementarity of its human  natural and financial resources and offer at the same time the best opportunities to take advantage of major international markets. I must stress that Africa is determined to fulfil its part of the contract in order to meet all the development targets set forth within the framework of the Community. To that end  it needs the constant support of the international community. Another of our concerns is the situation in South Africa  which has been included in our agenda for 46 years. While the international community was attempting to derive satisfaction from some of the progress achieved in negotiations  the events at Biopatong  along with the deliberate massacres at Ciskei on 7 September 1992  have strengthened our belief that the end of apartheid was proclaimed much too prematurely. My delegation believes that the South african Government must put an end to the escalation of violence  free political prisoners and rescind the Homelands Law and other discriminatory laws. Similarly  our country appreciates the recommendations made by the Secretary-General's Special Representative and also welcomes the sending of United Nations observers to assist in strengthening the structures established by the peace agreement. Negotiation is the only viable solution. The international community must encourage the resumption of the talks within the purview of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. The situation in many other African countries continues to concern us. I am thinking first of Liberia  a fraternal country and neighbour battered by destructive internal war. At any early stage the countries of West Africa members of the Economic Commission of West African States (ECOWAS) united in solidarity to seek a negotiated settlement. A peace plan was drawn up with the constant participation of all the parties to the conflict. The recent summit meeting of ECOWAS Heads of State  at Dakar  took new steps to make the peace plan fully effective. My Government appeals to the world Organization  and especially to the Security Council  to give unreserved support to the implementation of that plan. In addition  hundreds of millions of individuals have fled Liberia to seek refuge in Guinea  Cote d'lvoire and Sierra Leone. In Guinea alone there are nearly 600 000 refugees  two thirds of whom are children. The suffering endured by these human beings calls for additional efforts within the framework of the greatly appreciated assistance of the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees. What can we say about Somalia  now in flames and so sorely tried by famine and drought? My Government believes that peace can return to that country only if all the fighting factions display political will and agree to dialogue. Only the establishment of an immediate and definite cease-fire will enable the Somalians to engage in serious negotiations on the future of their country. Indeed  there is no point in turning to international forums for some futile recognition or confirmation. Our brothers in Somalia must agree to bury the hatchet of war and allow the international community to help them to help themselves. In addition to the political stakes  the tragedy in Somalia raises thorny humanitarian problems  for whose solution emergency measures have been effectively implemented through the joint efforts of the United Nations  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Organization of African Unity and many countries and non-governmental organizations. As for Angola  the cessation of hostilities and the dialogue opened between the parties to the conflict have made it possible to hold pluralistic elections. Not far away  in Mozambique  the Rome peace negotiations and the recent agreement reached in Botswana between RENAMO and the Maputo Government represent a decisive step towards settling that long and painful conflict. The crisis in Rwanda is the subject of joint discussions to restore stability and security among the countries of the subregion. Direct negotiations between the Government and the Rwanda Patriotic Front have emitted a glimmer of hope that an end may be put to a deadly conflict and that the bases of national unity may be strengthened. For many years  the crisis in the Middle East has occupied an important place in our discussions here in the Organization; it is still one of the greatest threats to international peace and security. The Palestinian question is at the heart of this formidable crisis. Only the return of all their rights to the Palestinian people under the auspices of the Palestine Liberation Organization  their sole and legitimate representative  can lead to a just  comprehensive and lasting solution. The Government of Guinea urges the parties to pursue the peace negotiations. By the same token  we support any other initiative directed towards breaking the log-jam in this situation quickly. With regard to Cambodia  the establishment of a Supreme National Council in Cambodia headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk is putting an end to a very difficult war and heralds the dawn of a new period which will  we hope  be characterized by a climate of tolerance and peaceful coexistence. Despite the efforts of the international community  engagements of a rare violence are tearing apart the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Every day the peoples of these lands are seeing their historic legacy  which it took them centuries to build  reduced to ruins. International pressure must continue to be brought to bear in order to assert international legality and human rights and to ensure they are respected. We welcome the peace efforts of the London Conference and the recent summit conference of the non-aligned countries. With regard to the question of Korea  my delegation supports the reunification process on the peninsula  from which nuclear weapons should be precluded. My Government appreciates all the efforts towards reconciliation  non-aggression  exchanges and cooperation between the two Koreas with a view to their peaceful reunification. The spectacular and most often rapid transformations taking place in the world today should have beneficial effects for disarmament and arms control. Even if on the bilateral level we are seeing agreements with regard to reducing or destroying certain types of weapons  at the multilateral level negotiations are marking time. The disappearance of the bipolar world is tending to make the senseless arms race incomprehensible. However  in this new context  the risk of war has not yet been ruled out  because of the existence of arsenals of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons. This is why the Republic of Guinea will continue to appeal urgently for general and complete disarmament. My delegation welcomes the appreciable results achieved in the negotiations on the signing of a convention on chemical weapons. However  the principal issues that are the cornerstone of disarmament  namely  the prohibition of nuclear tests and the arms race and the prevention of a nuclear war  have not experienced the same positive development. Moreover  the close interconnection established in 1987 by the International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development is still just as important: a reduction in military expenditures and budgets could boost economic and industrial activity in the have-not countries while strengthening the economic and social development efforts of developing countries. In recent years  relations between States have expanded and diversified. Multilateralism is strengthened as a result. The large number of States Members of the universal Organization increasingly reflects their desire to engage in integrated and coordinated action at the international level in order to take up the various challenges: the challenge of peace  the challenge of economic and social development and the challenge of the environment. Here is where multilateral relations must play an important role in mapping out the new order  which mankind hopes will be democratic and will generate prosperity for all. This is the path of multilateralism that the non-aligned countries recently embarked upon in Djakarta. Our Organization should take this duly into account in future international relations. The United Nations is in the process of carrying out positive work on various fronts; this is work which gives it undeniable authority  particularly in the area of the settlement of conflicts. Never before has there been such a strong consensus regarding the profound significance of peace. The aspiration of peoples to justice  security and greater prosperity has everywhere initiated an enormous process of social transformation  which is perceived as the obvious sign of democratic change. In the Republic of Guinea  the democratic transition is taking place peacefully. The constitutional institutions  governed by the principle of the separation of powers  are being established. Some 40 parties are engaged in the guest for political power. A supreme court  in which is invested the judicial power  will ensure that elections take place in a regular way. The legislative elections are scheduled for December 1992  followed immediately by presidential elections in 1993. The Government is pursuing a coherent policy of transition on the basis of dialogue and transparency. In any case  the form of democracy must be adjusted to suit the historical  economic  social and cultural realities of each country. The Government of Guinea  resolutely committed to building a State of law  supports the actions of the international community to promote and develop human rights. In this respect  Guinea welcomes the convening of the World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 and the international conference on the African child scheduled for November 1992 in Dakar. Here I wish to appeal urgently to the international community as a whole  and particular to the donors  to finance the various national programmes of action prepared in the context of the decade for children. Two important international events are to be commemorated in a few days' time by this Assembly  which will devote plenary meetings to them: the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons and the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the International Plan of Action on Ageing. My Government  which is always sensitive to the fate of these two social categories and their sufferings  is devoting a major part of its efforts under its national development programmes to them  and endorses the measures adopted as part of the Decade of Disabled Persons as well as those taken under the International Plan of Action on Ageing. For development strategies and programmes to be viable  they must pay particular attention to the problem of the environment. That is why my delegation requests the countries of the North to participate fully in financing Agenda 21  as defined and adopted in Rio  for the protection of the environment and lasting development. Another major source of concern is the production and consumption of drugs and the illicit traffic in them. To get rid of this scourge once and for all  police pressure  the destruction of plantations and the prohibition of money laundering must be backed up with the parallel development and promotion of substitute crops. The revitalization of the United Nations system is now a categorical imperative. This revitalization should in particular include enlarging the Security Council with a view to ensuring that a larger number of countries participate as permanent members. That reform could also make that vital body  responsible as it is for maintaining international peace and security  more efficient and effective. Expanding the Council is  in our opinion  one of the fundamental aspects of the democratization of international relations that is now needed. The Government of the Republic of Guinea attaches the utmost importance to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations and to respect for the principles of its Charter  which is a prerequisite for the advent of a new order based on justice for all and on peace  prosperity and international solidarity.

"62",2690,"GMB",47,1992,"The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a particularly crucial moment  when our Organization will be called upon to demonstrate innovative thinking and flexibility in the face of the emerging challenges. Against the background of the very important agenda that is before us  let me congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am confident that his professional competence and dynamism make him uniquely qualified to preside over the Assembly. I wish to assure him of my delegation's full support in carrying out his formidable task to a successful completion. Let me also extend our heartfelt appreciation to his predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-sixth session. Permit me  on behalf of the Government of the Gambia and on my own behalf  to express our heartfelt congratulations to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whom I have had the honour and privilege of knowing for many years. As a distinguished scholar  an outstanding diplomat and a person of exceptional character  Mr. Boutros Boutro-Ghali has in him those very fine qualities of leadership that our Organization needs at this very crucial period of its history. We in Africa are indeed honoured to have one of our illustrious sons serve in this highly prestigious and important  position. I am confident  and I am sure I am speaking for Africa and for all those who know Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  that he will live up to the very high expectations we all have of him. His long and distinguished career in the service of his country gives us reason for this trust. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his worthy predecessor  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  who during his tenure of office contributed greatly to the strengthening of the United Nations  allowing it to assume a lead role in promoting world peace and security. His indefatigable efforts in pursuit of an atmosphere of understanding for the solution of problems in different parts of the world are exemplary and deserve our very deep appreciation. I wish him a happy retirement. The Gambia notes with great pleasure the admission of the Republics of Belarus  San Marino  Croatia  Slovenia  Uzbekistan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan as new Members of the United Nations. I should like to welcome them and congratulate them on their accession to full membership of the United Nations. As they take their place in this comity of nations  it behoves each of us to extend to them the hand of friendship and support that characterizes this great Organization. As we reflect on the activities of our Organization during the past 12 months  we are encouraged by the numerous actions and decisions that have been taken in support of world peace and progress. Certainly  problems continue to exist  and in some cases have increased in intensity and complexity  but the full commitment of our Organization to resolving them remains ever strong. Other less conflictual but none the less important issues of concern to humanity have also received attention. I would like  in this respect  to refer to the historic Earth Summit  convened in Rio de Janeiro in June this year. This meeting  which brought together leaders from all over the world  marks the first major step taken by humanity to reflect upon and map out a strategy for the survival of all species on Earth. It marks the beginning of a more responsible attitude to the Earth and its resources. The Rio Declaration  the Agenda 21 programmes and the Conventions on climate change and bio-diversity all combine to lay the basis for a sustainable development. We fully support the recommendations of the Conference and do hope that the various programmes of Agenda 21 will receive adequate support and financing to ensure their successful implementation. Of special interest to our countries is the recommendation to set up an intergovernmental negotiating committee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification. We strongly urge the Assembly at this session to take the appropriate measures to allow the committee to commence its work as soon as possible. This century has witnessed two world wars  which brought untold hardship and suffering to mankind. The creation of the United Nations immediately after the Second World War reflected the determination of the founding fathers to spare future generations the scourge of war. We all know the story of what followed. The cold war  with its debilitating effects on the capacity of the United Nations  as well as the consequences of the destructive conflicts it engendered  demonstrated the extent to which our dreams and hopes became a nightmare. Today  mankind has been given an opportunity again to develop and anchor peace and stability in this world. The current entente in the international scene and the positive disposition of all nations vis-a-vis the United Nations provide a valuable opportunity for our Organization to assume a more forceful role in pursuit of world peace and stability. For it is only in peace and stability that human development can progress satisfactorily. We are very much encouraged by the important role the United Nations has recently assumed  and would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General for convening the Security Council summit meeting  which sought  among other things to promote greater understanding and cooperation in the world. We are in full support of the new approach to conflict resolution referred to as preventive diplomacy. Peace and security in the world will remain elusive as long as we continue to have centres of armed conflict that risk degenerating into regional conflicts that threaten world peace and stability. The situation in Somalia  the former Yugoslavia and other trouble spots around the world constitute an important threat to world peace and stability. We will need the collective resources and determination of the United Nations and all its Member States to resolve these conflicts. The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has deteriorated very seriously. The summary execution of civilian members of the non-Serbian population and the internment in concentration camps of thousands of people testify to gross human-rights abuses. The Gambia joins other nations in strongly condemning the perpetrators of these acts. We also condemn in no uncertain terms the concept of ""ethnic cleansing""  which in every respect is reminiscent of Nazi practices. It is totally unacceptable in this day and age to torture  kill or send into exile innocent men  women and children because of their religious beliefs. We will all be guilty if we stand by and see these atrocities being perpetrated with impunity. We fully appreciate and commend the bold efforts of the United Nations and the European Community in their search for peace in the former Yugoslavia. We salute the courage of all those taking part in humanitarian relief missions  particularly the soldiers who risk their lives to ensure that food and other relief items reach Bosnia and Herzegovina. We strongly believe that unless the fundamental cause of the conflict is addressed  the tragedy will continue. Serbian aggression against Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be stopped. We join the international community in calling on the United Nations to act firmly by implementing effectively the relevant Security Council resolutions on Yugoslavia  particularly resolution 757 (1992). The decision of the General Assembly to deny Serbia and Montenegro the seat of the former Yugoslavia  as contained in resolution 47/1 of 22 September 1992  is a step in the right direction. We believe the United Nations should not hesitate to use force to stop Serbian aggression  in conformity with the provisions of Article 42 of the United Nations Charter. In the meantime  the creation of an air corridor to protect relief supplies and innocent civilians from aerial bombardment would provide a useful respite in a desperate situation. The Gambia shares the concern of the international community over the lack of progress in finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Somalia. The scale of human tragedy remains a constant reminder of the horrors and absurdities of war. We fully endorse the urgent and effective implementation of Security Council resolution 767 (1992)  which calls for the cessation of hostilities  national reconciliation and unity in Somalia and the opening up of the country to humanitarian assistance. My delegation praises the laudable efforts of the United Nations  the United States of America and relief agencies for the assistance they are providing to the starving population of Somalia. We want to appeal to all those who exercise some influence over the various warring factions to use their influence now in support of Security Council resolution 767 (1992). Without peace the humanitarian assistance will continue but so will the human tragedy. On the question of Liberia  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) continues to grapple with the problem of effective implementation of the Yamoussoukro IV accord in order to bring about lasting peace in Liberia and to arrest the growth of destabilizing forces in the subregion. We continue to appeal to all the parties concerned  in particular the leadership of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia  to adhere to the provisions of the Yamoussoukro IV accord as further elaborated at Geneva in April this year. We make a strong appeal to the United Nations and the international community to give full support to the efforts of ECOWAS to bring about peace and stability in Liberia.  With reference to South Africa  it is disappointing to note that the euphoria and optimism that greeted the release of Nelson Mandela and other prisoners have failed to materialize into a free  democratic and non-racial South Africa. The suspension of the talks in the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and the continued acts of violence and senseless killings  as highlighted in Boipatong township in June and in Ciskei in September  call into question the commitment of the South African Government. We would like to state again that the South African Government bears a major responsibility for these acts of lawlessness. It will have to demonstrate greater responsibility in ensuring the security of all South Africans. It is time to turn this tragic page and allow discussions that will bring peace  stability and progress to South Africa. We appeal to all the parties to assist in this process. We are following with keen interest the developments in the Middle East peace process which started in Madrid almost a year ago. We sincerely hope that the opportunity provided by that process will be taken up by all the parties to ensure that the region  which has been denied peace for so long  will ultimately enjoy a comprehensive and lasting peace on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The world has yet to become the haven of peace and stability we so earnestly work for. The conflicts in Cambodia  Afghanistan and some of the recently independent republics of the former Soviet Union reflect the very difficult moments of transition. We are confident that with the full support of the international community these difficulties will be overcome. Another danger to world stability is poverty and lack of economic development. The developing countries continue to be saddled with overriding  debt  low commodity prices and sluggish if not stagnant economies. Nowhere is the situation more bleak and desperate as in Africa  where the cumulative debt stands at around $27 2 billion  the approximate equivalent of 90 per cent of the continent's gross national product. Debt-service obligations require about $25 billion annually  representing 30 per cent of the continent's export earnings. Failure to effect timely payments has led to increases in interest payments  at the rate of over $1 billion a year. I believe those figures are an eloquent testimony to the plight of Africa today. The rest of the world must not remain insensitive to that plight. The adoption at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of a new agenda for the development of Africa in the 1990s has helped focus attention once again on Africa's critical economic situation. We will need  however  to go beyond words. In this connection I wish to echo the Secretary-General's proposals for the cancellation of all official bilateral debts  the cancellation of other semi-official debts such as export credits  and the substantial reduction of debts owed to multilateral financial institutions  which now account for 40 per cent of sub-Saharan debt servicing. It is regrettable to note that these proposals  considered more favourable to Africa than the Trinidad terms  have not yet received positive and widespread acceptance from Africa's development partners. Africa  like other developing regions  will require a substantial inflow of capital and technology and access to international markets if the global partnership is to have any meaning for us. The Gambia shares with the rest of Africa this very heavy financial burden  in spite of her efforts at economic recovery. In fact  the Gambia has successfully undertaken an economic recovery programme  and has since 1991 started a programme for sustained development. The main policy orientation of the programme for sustained development is the pursuit of continuous adjustment with growth  with the objective of achieving economic development in a liberalized market environment. This will allow mobilization of the resources of the private sector to provide the investment that will generate sustained economic growth and expansion. By expanding the productive capacity of the economy  we hope to be able to support a significant improvement in the living standards of Gambians. The attainment of economic growth requires a favourable external environment. Secondly  a conducive international economic and financial environment will help resolve the international debt crisis  restore adequate capital flows and create a more open world trading system  which will result in sustained economic expansion and enhance private and public spending on human development. We fully appreciate the very valuable assistance being given by the United Nations  the international financial institutions and friendly countries. However  there is a need for continued external assistance in support of our development efforts. In this regard  we fervently hope that the donors' conference for the Gambia  to be held in Geneva on 13 and 14 October 1992  will be as successful as previous ones. Today we are witnessing the emergence of a new world order grounded in the principles of respect for human rights  political pluralism and self-determination. This new world order  which is still unfolding  marks the end of the cold war and the beginning of a strengthened role for the United Nations. In Africa  marching side by side with the economic problems has been the desire for greater democratization and liberalization of political attitudes  systems and dogmas. In the face of this new socio-political revolution  the Gambia has consistently maintained its practice of the rule of law  and adherence to parliamentary democracy  as exemplified by its successful and regular conduct of free and fair elections since the attainment of independence in 1965. Under the wise and distinguished leadership of Alhaji Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara  the Gambia continues to advocate the promotion of  and adherence to human rights practices all over the world. The Gambia therefore welcomes the holding of the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993. That Conference will not only afford all peace-loving people  nations and institutions the opportunity to express their concern on human rights issues  but will also serve as a means for the objective evaluation of the world's human rights records and practices and an opportunity for us to rededicate ourselves to the achievement of higher standards of human rights practices throughout the world. In full recognition of the universal application of human rights and democracy  my delegation is pleased to note the implementation of General Assembly resolution 45/164  which proclaimed 1993 the International Year for the World's Indigenous People. This proclamation will further strengthen international cooperation in seeking solutions to the problems confronting indigenous communities in the areas of human rights  the environment  development  education  and health  and we regard it as a first step towards mobilizing greater international support and assistance for the self-development of indigenous peoples and their communities.  The United Nations is particularly well placed to focus attention on major issues of concern to humankind. Of special interest to us today is the welfare of children  which was brought to the forefront by the World Summit for Children. The Gambia pledges to continue to formulate plans  programmes and laws to safeguard the rights and interests of children and women  who  effectively  constitute the most important and productive category of our population. The Government of the Gambia fully supports the convening of the forthcoming international conference on assistance to African children  scheduled to take place in Dakar  Senegal from 25 to 27 November 1992. We strongly urge the international community to lend support to that conference. Mobilizing African and international support for the global goals for children in the 1990s is one of the biggest challenges we now face as a world community. Together we can make the conference a significant step in the process towards achieving the goals of the World Summit. Another major issue of global concern today is the question of AIDS and HIV infections  which  in the last few years  have grown into a global pandemic with no effective cure as yet. It has been estimated that  by the end of this century  40 million people will have been affected by the virus and more than 10 million children will have become orphans. This is indeed a gloomy prediction. The situation therefore calls for greater and more sustained efforts in combating the AIDS pandemic. It calls for collective global responsibility based on learning from  sharing with  and giving assistance to each other. My delegation realizes that the United Nations will be increasingly called upon to undertake many more responsibilities in a world that is rapidly changing. If it is to succeed in handling the growing complexities of today  then it must be adequately structured to respond to the emerging challenges. The Gambia has followed with keen interest the deliberations of the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council in July 1992  and the efforts to restructure the Council. Indeed  these efforts are part of the larger and wider process of restructuring the United Nations system initiated by the Secretary-General. The Gambia welcomes the creation of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs under the dynamic leadership of Jan Eliasson as Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator. The creation of this Department is not only timely but crucial  given its role of providing relief and solace to the millions of needy people all over the world  especially in areas suffering from armed conflict  poverty  population pressures  environmental degradation and human rights violations  in keeping with the provisions and spirit of General Assembly resolution 46/182. It is also gratifying to note that some of the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the establishment of a Commission for Sustainable Development and issues relating to the global environment facility were considered and approved by the Economic and Social Council. The addition of the high-level-segment debate in the plenary session of the Council and the dialogue between participants that accompanied it is also welcome. We in Africa continue to support General Assembly resolution 32/197  which calls for structural  administrative and financial reforms of the United Nations system  particularly the strengthening of policy-making at the level of the General Assembly in the economic  social and other related fields. As we begin the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly  our minds are still fresh with some of the relevant and important recommendations of the Economic and Social Council on the economic and social issues which affect the world and demand urgent attention. We are at an exciting junction of history. The positive changes we have witnessed in global political and economic trends are a clear manifestation of mankind's desire for a progressive world and a better future. However  the goals of global peace  security and progress will continue to elude us if poverty  human rights violations and economic disparity  which are at the root of many conflicts  continue to characterize our world. The United Nations has a special role to play in combatting these evils. The Gambia remains fully committed to joining hands with all nations to support the United Nations in its crusade for a happier  more stable and prosperous world. "
"63",2730,"GNB",47,1992,"On behalf of my country and Government  I should like first of all to convey our congratulations to Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His competence and the wealth of experience he has acquired during his career as a diplomat in the service of his country  Bulgaria which enjoys great prestige on the international scene constitute  for the members of the Assembly  a sure guarantee for the success of our work. My delegation particularly welcomes this choice of President because our two countries have good relations  which are marked  among other things  by the massive assistance which his country gave to the heroic liberation struggle of our people and of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) against colonialism. Because of this  I should like here and now to assure him of my delegation's cooperation in carrying out the lofty mission the Assembly has just entrusted to him. My delegation offers its congratulations and expresses its gratitude to Mr. Samir Shihabi  who  with great talent  wisdom and efficiency  guided the work of the forty-sixth session. We wish him every success in his future endeavours. Our congratulations and our thanks also go to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his tireless  constant  clear-sighted and successful efforts to safeguard peace and security the world over. We also pay tribute to the Secretary-General's dedication  to his visionary ability and his capacity to act  and  particularly  to his concern for preserving the prestige and the effectiveness of the United Nations in all circumstances. To his predecessor  Mr. Perez de Cuellar  who worked relentlessly for the renewal of the United Nations system  the establishment of international peace and security and development  we extend all our congratulations and a ringing tribute for the work he accomplished in the service of the international community. We wish him also every success in his future endeavours. The admission of new Members is an important stage in attaining the universality of the Organization  thereby enabling it to undertake greater action and giving it greater dynamism to achieve its objectives. That is why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau welcomes with joy the new Members that have joined our great family since the forty-sixth session. The delegation of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau congratulates all those countries. The forty-seventh session is being held at a time when international relations have been given a new momentum for progress and dynamism; and this  thanks to far-reaching changes taking place in the world. The Secretary-General  at the request of the Security Council  has submitted to us a report entitled  ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  in which he refers quite rightly to the concept of preventive diplomacy and the idea of the maintenance  strengthening and consolidation of peace throughout the world. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau supports these initiatives. This new dynamic which today characterizes international relations  henceforth freed from the cold war  is a source of great hope for stability and opens up prospects for peace  understanding and cooperation which have enabled the United Nations to help in taking concrete initiatives for settling many conflicts. Yes  the world today has undergone extraordinary change. Everywhere the movement in favour of better democratization and of respect for basic human rights is emerging. We know that such claims will go unheeded if they are not accompanied by the same vital movement for prosperity and well-being. Furthermore  a number of important and dramatic events have afflicted us in recent times and have led us to be pessimistic. I am convinced that today  as in the past  the Assembly will be able to find its bearings again. The situation in southern Africa is hardly improving in spite of the announcement of reforms that will put an end to the system of apartheid. In view of recent developments in that country we are still concerned. However we are following with great interest measures to abolish segregationist laws adopted by the South African Government and we urge it to continue negotiations with the anti-apartheid movements for the final elimination of the apartheid system in that country where the overwhelming majority of the population still does not have the right to vote  to decide its own future and freely choose its leaders. Inter-ethnic violence caused and maintained by certain backward-looking forces continues to bring the country bloodshed and affliction. My delegation invites the international community to maintain pressure on the South African Government so that the process that has begun may lead to the total elimination of apartheid and to the establishment of a democratic and multiracial society. The Assembly is certainly aware of the fraternal links of friendship which bind the people of Guinea-Bissau to the brother people of Angola. That is why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  its people and its Government were overjoyed at the peace process which has begun in that country and which has led to the establishment of a multiparty system and of democratic  free and universal elections. For the Angolan people new prospects have opened up enabling it to undertake the reconstruction and development of its sorely-tried homeland. On this occasion of celebrating peace and regained harmony the Government of Guinea-Bissau reiterates its fraternal feelings of solidarity and its wishes for prosperity for Angola. We earnestly hope that the peace process in Mozambique will have the same outcome and that the international community might soon be able to celebrate the end of the painful fate into which the civil war has plunged that country. We encourage the Mozambican Government to continue along the path of dialogue and we exhort RENAMO to show good will in order to allow for the speedy establishment of peace in that country so sorely tried by so many years of violence. In Western Sahara we hope that the necessary conditions will quickly be met so that a referendum on self-determination under the aegis of the United Nations might be held as soon as possible in order to establish a lasting climate of peace and security in that region. In Liberia as well  the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to create an atmosphere that would lead to a normalization of the political situation and to the holding of democratic elections  have  unfortunately  not yet borne fruit. We reiterate our appeal to the warring parties  especially the National Patriotic Forces of Liberia  to comply scrupulously with the Yamoussoukro agreements  especially the agreement reached on 30 October 1991. The quest for a dynamic solution for a global settlement of the problems of that country are based on essential respect for the rights of all. It does not depend only on the willingness of States and people in the region; it must also commit all of us who  for various reasons  have an impact on the behaviour of the various protagonists so that there might be a lasting and just peace. Somalia has become a field of carnage and of constant concern to the international community. For some time now we have been seeing a fratricidal civil war with disastrous consequences for that country and its defenceless civilian population. The Assembly  a forum for heightening awareness and a court of appeal  will not fail to ask the international community to give more coherent and concrete assistance in the face of this new development in order to bring this bloody and outrageous conflict to an end. We appeal most urgently to the parties involved in the conflict to comply with the agreements signed in Djibouti and to agree to mitigate the sufferings of that brave people. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau  for its part  supports any proposal to find a peaceful solution to this conflict as soon as possible. In the Horn of Africa there is also Ethiopia  the authorities of which we would like to encourage to continue the dialogue begun for lasting peace and security in that country and in the region. In the Middle East  we are convinced that peace is possible if the parties to the conflict are imbued with the necessary political will. Guinea-Bissau hopes that a rapid  negotiated solution might be found to the problem of the Middle East so that the peoples of that region might be able to live in peace. The Palestinian people are however entitled to a homeland  to a sovereign State  within secure and internationally acknowledged borders. My country therefore supports and encourages all the initiatives undertaken to restore peace between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples. We welcome the prospects opened up for the restoration of peace and security in Lebanon. The whole world admires the courage of the Lebanese and I am certain that the whole world will help them to bring about the triumph of their ideas. The Lebanese people will find a source of justified pride in this. In Cambodia  new prospects for a lasting peace were opened after the negotiations. One of the most recent prospects is the organization of free elections  being prepared with the welcome assistance of the United Nations  which we should like to commend and encourage. We believe and hope that the organization of these free and democratic elections will put an end to the long years of suffering endured by the heroic people of Cambodia. As to the question of East Timor  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau is hoping for an acceptable and speedy peaceful conclusion to this serious problem  which is a source of concern to us. The Maubere people must regain its legitimate right to self-determination and independence  if it so wishes. I repeat: if it so wishes. That is why we welcome the high-level meeting of delegations of Portugal and Indonesia under the auspices of the United Nations with a view to finding the necessary framework for a settlement suitable to all the parties to the conflict. We should like to assure all the parties involved in the process of seeking a favourable and speedy outcome of the conflict of our availability and support. In spite of their admission to the United Nations  the two Koreas have yet to find common ground for the reunification of the great Korean nation. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is privileged to have good economic and diplomatic relations with the two Koreas - north and south. That is why we appeal to them to continue negotiations for the speedy reunification of the great Korean homeland. Similarly  the Republic of Guinea-Bissau urges the Cypriot communities to continue negotiations  with the assistance of the Secretary-General  for a peaceful settlement of the Cypriot conflict. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau  again within the context of the quest for peace and harmony among nations  has undertaken diplomatic relations of cooperation and friendship with all countries throughout the world that fervently seek peace and justice. Guided by this thinking  we also maintain diplomatic relations of cooperation and friendship with the Republic of China (Taiwan). That is why we support and endorse the reference made to that country by the President of Nicaragua from this rostrum. In this regard  we pay a well-deserved tribute to the valuable assistance given to my country's development efforts by another country from the developing world the Republic of China whose economic performance  which now puts it among the major economic Powers of the world  is in many regards exemplary. In Latin America  we welcome and support the peace process begun under United Nations auspices for the restoration of security and stability in that region. Since the developments of 30 September in Haiti  President Aristide  the constitutionally elected President  and his Government are still waiting to take up their legitimate places  to which they are entitled. The international community and the Organization of American States should help them in that regard. Guinea-Bissau  which hopes for a peaceful and speedy settlement of that conflict  urges all the parties involved to heed reason and to respect the basic rights of the Haitian people. The growing tension and conflict in Central and Eastern Europe are jeopardizing international peace and security. Guinea-Bissau is anxiously following the evolution of the situation in the former Yugoslavia. Each day we deplore the violence and the hatred in the confrontations that have cost so many human lives. That is why the Republic of Guinea-Bissau commends the initiatives and the efforts of the United Nations  through its Secretary-General  and of the European Economic Community with a view to achieving a peaceful solution to the inter-ethnic conflict. The successful missions already conducted and the restored confidence in the Organization give solid grounds for satisfaction and  above all  for hope. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau hopes that all those involved in conflict will rediscover the virtues of dialogue and cooperation  which are the only arms that lead to peace. The Government of General Joao Bernardo Viera  President of the Council of State of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau  has committed all of Guinea-Bissau to a process of pluralist democratization and to the establishment of a State of law  as well as to the improvement and recovery of the economy  with a view to greater social justice. The process of democratization now under way in Guinea-Bissau is perceived everywhere as the clear sign of fundamental change  whose goal is justice  social stability and greater well-being. So that it can be effective and practical  this process is based on my country's historical social and cultural realities. In our view  the recent adoption of our Electoral Law narrows the gap between the aspirations of our people and reality  and gives all citizens the means to express themselves freely and indeed to be free. The progressive  disengagement of the State from the industrial and commercial sector  the encouragement of private initiative  the promotion of private property and the creation of conditions of social stability  unity and national cohesion are at the heart of these transformations now taking place in our country. However  experience has shown that the attainment of democratic objectives in African countries is necessarily accompanied by some degree of problems and of questioning. The determination to democratize is unfortunately facing difficulties that stem from the implementation of structural adjustment policies  which  it should be stressed  do not have the expected donor support. This situation worsens the state of impoverishment and the feeling of frustration of our peoples. The dependence of Guinea-Bissau  in particular  and of African States  in general  on international agencies and bilateral partners is thereby strengthened. There can be no doubt that we are at a uniquely decisive and historic stage in which all efforts must converge to strengthen the positive trends that we have observed and to make them irreversible and give a new dimension to the relations between parties and States. This new trend which today characterizes international relations bears the hope of stability and has opened up prospects of peace and understanding. Guinea-Bissau has  in every instance  endeavoured to work in its foreign relations towards a policy based on confidence  dialogue and harmony. The process of democratic openness begun in Guinea-Bissau and the resulting economic liberalization require the constant support of the international community. This democratic process deserves to be supported  because there can be no real democracy without development. It is therefore clear that a democracy which is not founded on a solid economic base is but an illusion. It is virtually impossible today to discuss international relations without recalling  with sadness  the seriousness of the economic crisis of the developing countries in general and of the African countries in particular. The decline in export earnings  foreign debt and the inadequacy of resources for development  compounded by natural disasters  have served to further deteriorate socio-economic conditions in many countries. The United Nations has become aware of this situation and has adopted the Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development for our benefit. None the less  the objectives sought have not been attained. The response of the developed countries and of international economic and financial institutions has not been commensurate with their commitments  though most of the African countries have agreed to carry out the reforms imposed upon them. Africa remains ready  however  to reaffirm its commitment to apply the necessary transformation policies  as evidenced  inter alia  by the adoption of the African Charter for Popular Participation in Development and Transformation  and the proposals made as a result of the final assessment of the Programme. The new framework for cooperation must ensure sufficient resources; debt reduction and cancellation; and the adoption of lasting solutions to commodities problems  in the hope that the agreement thus reached will receive the full support of Africa's partners. In spite of the truly commendable efforts made by the African Governments in the framework of implementing programmes of structural adjustment  our economic situation and living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult. The Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development  1986 to 1990  which had given rise to such hopes  unfortunately has not responded to the legitimate concerns of the African peoples and leaders for growth and for viable economic and social development. The approaches taken thus far to finding a solution to the serious problem of debt  while encouraging in certain respects  are far from responding to the real economic concerns of the developing countries. The search for a solution to the foreign-debt problem of the developing countries must not only involve a further strengthening of solidarity in the international community and shared responsibility between creditors and debtors  but must also take into account the growth objective of the developing countries. As we noted earlier  the world is experiencing extraordinary change. Everywhere  the trend towards greater democratization and towards respect for fundamental human rights is in evidence. But we know that these demands will go unheeded if they are not accompanied by an equally vital drive towards well-being and prosperity. Furthermore  the international community must give special attention to the implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s  adopted at the Paris Conference  which remains a charter for us all. We make a pressing appeal to the international community that urgent and appropriate action be taken with a view to the adoption of a consistent programme of cooperation for the development of the developing countries  and above all  of Africa  an almost forgotten continent. In this respect  my delegation welcomes the initiative of the Japanese Government to convene once again in 1993 a summit conference on the development of Africa  as well as the French proposal  made by President Francois Mitterrand  to convene a high-level meeting on social development. The course charted by our countries towards greater freedom and democracy supports the concept expressed in the ""Human Development Report"" recently published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  which recommends ""a participative form of development in which the human being is placed at the center of the decision-making process"". In this context  we are gratified by and we unreservedly support the decision to convene a World Conference on Human Rights as planned for 1993 in Vienna. Along these same lines  women in Guinea-Bissau participated equally with men in the liberation struggle in our country. At the same time  they fought to win their freedom and emancipation. It is for all these reasons that my Government unreservedly supports the World Conference on Women  to be held in 1995. This long-awaited Conference will provide an opportunity to review at a very high level the problems of women in the world. Sustainable and lasting economic and social development can only be achieved in the context of a healthy environment. In our opinion  the Rio Conference was a success  but the implementation of the decisions reached in that important and high-level forum will be even more decisive. After the holding of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  we focus our hopes today on the Commission on Sustainable Development  which is to meet at the ministerial level  and whose task it will be to follow up the implementation of the programmes contained in Agenda 21 and to see to it that they are implemented in an integrated manner. In that connection  may I  on behalf of my delegation  extend our warmest congratulations and sincerest thanks to Mr. Maurice Strong for the remarkable work that he accomplished at the head of a team whose dynamism  expertise and effectiveness are today recognized by all delegations. Mr. Strong's tireless efforts throughout the preparatory process as well as his personal commitment to the noble task assigned to him by the international community were the best guarantee of the historic success of the Rio de Janeiro Conference. It is our hope and our belief that he is among the best-qualified people  if not the best-qualified person  to guide the initial steps of the secretariat of that Commission. This is certainly vital to ensure the effective implementation and prompt follow-up of the commitments reached in Rio. In this connection  the secretariat of the Commission on Sustainable Development will necessarily require an identifiable structure. Its staff must be highly qualified and conform to an equitable geographical distribution  and it must base itself on the experience acquired in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development preparatory process.* The President returned to the Chair. The idea of rapidly establishing a structure and staff for the implementation of the recommendations and decisions of the Rio Conference prompts us to consider that solutions to environmental problems must necessarily take into account development in all its dimensions  particularly in its regional socio-economic dimensions. Part of Guinea-Bissau  a member of the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS)  is in a region afflicted by drought. We call urgently for the rapid establishment of an intergovernmental committee that will be entrusted with the development of an international convention to fight drought and desertification. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau reaffirms once again its support of the Bamako Convention  which prohibits the importing of waste to Africa  and the Bamako Commitment of the African countries regarding their priorities in the field of the environment. The World Summit for Children  held in 1990  broke new ground for the improvement of living conditions of children the world over. We have adhered to and implemented the decisions and recommendations that came out of that Summit. As our immortal leader Amilcar Cabral said  ""Children are the flowers of our struggle and the reason for our fight."" The Organization of African Unity (OAU) Conference on the African Child  which will be held next November in Dakar  Senegal  will be an opportunity to show our active solidarity with children  who  unfortunately  suffer from so many problems and also to show that the international community is in solidarity with all African youth. Now that tensions between East and West have been resolved and ideological antagonism has ended  it remains for us to pay attention to the developmental problems of the poor countries and thus to ensure international peace and security. In this very Assembly  for years on end  high-ranking personages have from this rostrum drawn our attention to the decisive role of disarmament in the evolution of the developing countries. This is a dimension that we must never forget in our work. That is why the Government of Guinea-Bissau supports the establishment of a moral and political climate that encourages the total elimination of all arms of destruction  because reductions in military budgets and expenditures will benefit economic and social development in many parts of the world at large and in Africa in particular. Like the environment  other problems suffered by Africa AIDS  tuberculosis  yellow fever  drugs and more could be faced up to with the support and effective assistance provided by the colossal sums of money that would be freed up through complete and total disarmament. But at this point we should like to commend the United Nations system  the funding bodies and the international organizations both governmental and non-governmental such as the World Health Organization (WHO) for their efforts and support thus far in helping us face the scourges that ravage our continent. In spite of the uncertainties hanging over the global economy and international relations in general and above all the risk of marginalization for the African continent  it is unthinkable that the peoples  countries and Governments affected by crisis might yield to disarray or discouragement.

"64",2769,"GNQ",47,1992,"We are pleased to express our warmest and most sincere congratulations to Mr. Ganev on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session and on the competent and dynamic manner in which he has been conducting the Assembly's proceedings. We are convinced that achievements and successes will be the common denominator of his term of office. To his predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  we express our profound appreciation for the exemplary way in which he conducted the proceedings of the previous session.

Given the complexity of this task  we extend our best wishes to you for your own personal well-being and that of your family. Our greetings and warm welcomes go to the new States that have joined the United Nations family. As in a traditional family  the birth of a new member is a symbol of joy and hope: joy  because of the new-found vitality of our Organization; and hope  because of the new experiences  opinions and alternatives that there will be to enable us to resolve the problems and situations confronting the international community. Our Government  in the conviction that there can be no better unity than that which flows from and is based on diversity  has formally recognized all those States that are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States  and has initiated and established diplomatic relations with each of them; our Government hopes to be able to proceed in the same manner with each of the new Members of the United Nations family. On the political scene  the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place at a historic time characterized by new crises  new obscurantism and new methods of exerting pressure and oppression that stand in real contrast to the hope and the optimism that filled the international community with the end of the cold war. The reason for this is very clear and appropriately reflected in the report of the Secretary-General  in which he so rightly states that: ""The cold war confronted the international community with a singular threat to security; now  a widely varying array of resentments  ambitions  rivalries and hatreds masked for decades have come to the fore to threaten international harmony and shared purpose."" (A/47/1  para. Ill) Figure 6 of that report  on peace-keeping forces and observer missions  testifies most tellingly to this sad reality: before 1988  the United Nations had conducted 13 missions  while between then and now there have been 14 of them in only four of the Organization's 47 years of existence. True  there are glimpses of optimistic  hopeful signs on the horizon; however  it is also true that all generations have the right to live in peace  justice and security and to enjoy life so as to leave a better legacy to future generations. We note that high-level international conferences are being held these days in order to find solutions to the problems facing peoples and nations: New York saw the World Summit for Children in September 1990; Geneva hosted the summit on the advancement of the rights of rural women this year; Rio de Janeiro hosted the Earth Summit in June 1992; the international community's agenda includes the holding of the second World Conference on Human Rights in 1993  the conference on population and development in 1994 and on the advancement of women and on social development in 1995. Equatorial Guinea welcomes these and other similar events  and once again reaffirms that  for these events to succeed and their results to be implemented in practice  the principle of the self-determination of peoples and the promotion of responsible relations between States are necessary conditions if justice  peace and international security are to prevail. In South Africa  apartheid and racial discrimination continue to claim innocent victims. In Somalia  selfish political interests and the desire for power have combined with natural disasters to accelerate the disappearance of an entire nation. The civil war in Liberia  which continues to claim victims and cause the permanent exodus of its citizens  has spilled over its borders  destabilizing the countries of the subregion and blocking the way towards a peaceful solution to the conflict: the holding of free elections in an atmosphere of peace and security. In the former Yugoslavia  war is resorted to in order to slow down the effects of the end of the cold war  setting an extremely dangerous precedent  bearing in mind that the geopolitical and demographic spectrum of the former Yugoslavia is not unique in the community of nations. Our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  pointed out that sad reality when he rightly wrote: ""This is  then  a conflict with an international dimension. The future shape and security of one or more Member States indeed their very existence has come under threat."" (A/47/1  para. 141) On the Korean Peninsula  as in Cyprus  intervention and interference in the internal affairs of States  including foreign occupation and domination  continue to play the same role as they did in the days of the cold war. The legitimate desire of the Korean people  both North and South  to see their country reunited  and the legitimate aspiration of Cypriots to attain their national identity  free from ethnic disputes and narrow-minded nationalism  are receding farther and farther from the process of peaceful solution and are disappearing in the sea of hegemonic interests. We believe that the best contribution that the international community  the United Nations and peoples who love peace and justice can make to the peaceful and lasting solution of these and other conflicts is  above and beyond all interests  to ensure respect for the self-determination of the peoples affected. In Equatorial Guinea we welcome and applaud the efforts to restore peace and justice to all the affected areas and the multifaceted humanitarian assistance provided by the international community in the collective framework of the United Nations system in general and in particular the European Economic Community  the Organization of African Unity  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Economic Community of West African States  the United States of America  Japan and other States and governmental and non-governmental charitable bodies. The increasingly acute economic and financial crisis afflicting all countries  and the developing ones in particular  with special emphasis on the least developed countries  still rests on the well-known pillars built by the current economic order  which has been so often denounced in almost all international forums. With the passing of time  the external debt becomes ever more unpayable  in spite of the constant efforts and sacrifices the debtors make to increase the output of raw materials and export commodities while accepting the discipline imposed by structural adjustment programmes. In the international markets  to which access is difficult because of the protectionist policies of the fortunate countries of the North  the prices of raw materials remain low  while the prices of manufactured goods remain high  much to the despair of the less fortunate countries of the South. We are sure that everything needed to solve these and other problems in the context of international cooperation for development is within our grasp: a reduction in military budgets and progress in disarmament and the curbing of the arms race  which  together with democracy  free markets and respect for fundamental freedoms  would carry us swiftly to the goal that we all share: well-being. We take the opportunity given us by this world forum to express in this context our profound and sincere gratitude to the World Bank  the International Monetary Fund  the United Nations Development Programme and other international financial organizations and individual countries for their ongoing contribution to the task of rehabilitating and rebuilding the economic and financial structure of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. From this rostrum we invite them all to continue along that path and to support Equatorial Guinea on the occasion of the Third Round Table  to be held soon in Geneva  Switzerland. Equatorial Guinea cannot presume to be immune to and free of the ills  often a legacy of the past  that afflict national communities and the world community in the vital social domain and in the equally vital area of human rights. The economic and financial restrictions caused by the unbalanced international economic order prevent our having enough schools and training centres and make us unable to guarantee the provision of health services meeting the needs of all our inhabitants. Nevertheless  the effort of our Government  within the limitations of its modest means  combined with the assistance received from friendly countries and international organizations  is becoming increasingly evident in improvements in those sectors. We in Equatorial Guinea believe that as long as a people lacks a basic infrastructure to resolve problems of education  medical and pharmaceutical care  a clean environment  drinking water  housing and so on there should be serious  profound reflection on the concept of human rights. In the face of all the factors affecting the human being  including the challenges of his natural enemies  our Government has started out on the road to the fullest enjoyment of fundamental freedoms and the guarantee of respect for human rights. In this context  we express our deepest appreciation to the following for their support of the work being carried out by our national constitutional bodies and special commissions  such as the National Commission on Human Rights  the National Commission of Support for the Children of Equatorial Guinea and the National Commission for the Protection of the Environment  to name but a few: the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  the World Health Organization  the United Nations Children's Fund  the World Food Programme  the United Nations Population Fund and all those others that directly or indirectly provide effective and disinterested assistance to our country. On mentioning  however briefly  the question of human rights  I cannot fail to refer to the erroneous image of our country held by the Commission on Human Rights and certain journalistic circles. We believe and maintain that the Commission is an organ at the service of the United Nations and therefore of the Member States. Its components  including experts and rapporteurs  cannot become prosecutors acting against sovereign States Members of the United Nations  nor can they assume the role that a country's legal system and international law grant to State authorities. We have seen  to our regret  that in exchange for the firm political will and readiness of our Government to promote respect for human rights in Equatorial Guinea by providing  inter alia  all sorts of logistical assistance local transportation  public and private contacts  access to public and private locations and places that were off limits for security reasons  and so on - the report of the Rapporteur assigned to Equatorial Guinea only denigrates the image of our country and its Government  incites violence and undermines the peace and order that prevail in our country. While flatly rejecting the report presented to the Commission on Human Rights at its session in Geneva in March 1992 for its lack of realism and objectivity  the Government of Equatorial Guinea pledges to the international community that it will  within its means  continue its programme in defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms  launched on 3 August 1979  in a climate of peace  justice  harmony and understanding  and that it will not allow itself to be swayed by attempts at intimidation and/or provocation. Equatorial Guinea wishes to express its satisfaction at the bilateral and multilateral efforts made by the international community to promote global  regional and subregional disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons. In this regard  we welcome the decision taken by the General Assembly  at the initiative of the Economic Community of Central African States  to support the formulation of confidence-building  disarmament and development measures  as well as the establishment of a Standing Consultative Committee to deal with questions of security in Central Africa. We hope that its programme and timetable of activities  drawn up during the organizational meeting held in Yaounde in July 1992  will be given the complete support of the Assembly at this session. We could not conclude this statement without availing ourselves of the opportunity to inform the Assembly of the current state of the democratization process being carried out in our country. We overwhelmingly approved our new Fundamental Law at the end of last year. It is based  inter alia. ""on the principles of social justice  reaffirmed solemnly in instruments on the rights and freedoms of the human being  as defined and enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights"". At the same time  it recognizes political pluralism in Equatorial Guinea. A set of laws regulating these rights and freedoms was promulgated early this year  and a transition Government was established with the sole and exclusive task of preparing the people and adapting the Republic's institutions to current realities  characterized by the multiparty democracy that has been in effect over the 12-month period that will end on December 1992. At present  five political parties the Partido Democratico de Guinea Ecuatorial  the Union Popular  the Convencion Liberal Democratica  the Partido Social Democrata and the Union para la Democracia Social - have been registered and given official status under the provisions of the Law on Political Parties of 6 January 1992. These parties are already conducting their political activities throughout the country in a climate of dialogue  order  peace and tranquillity. In the same direction  and with the two-fold objective of involving all the country's forces in the construction of a new era of democratic coexistence  on the one hand  and of alleviating the sad and heavy burden that the phenomenon of exile and displaced persons places on the international community  on the other  the President of the Republic  His Excellency Mr. Obiang Nguema Mbasogo  approved and promulgated for the second time since 1979 the Law on Amnesty  under which ""All acts of commission or omission of a political nature committed by Equatorial Guineans and characterized as political offences and crimes in the Criminal Code or in special criminal laws passed prior to 2 December 1991 shall be forgiven and forgotten."" Therefore ""All citizens of Equatorial Guinea granted this amnesty who are outside the country will be able freely to enter the national territory and reside therein. They shall be entitled to all rights and freedoms under the conditions set forth in the Fundamental Law and other legal provisions of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea."" In this context  we hope that  on the same humanitarian grounds that inspired the Governments of the host countries and the international governmental and non-governmental organizations  they will continue to give all assistance necessary to facilitate the voluntary return of our brothers and sisters  just as our Government has already taken  and will continue to take  steps to do so and to ensure their integration into the society of Equatorial Guinea. In the coming months  the People's House of Representatives - the parliament of Equatorial Guinea - will be taking a decision on the draft Electoral Law  which is to be formulated with the help and participation of all duly constituted political parties. This will conclude the planned medium-term actions and will lead to the final stage in the process of democratization through the organization and holding of municipal  legislative and presidential elections in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. May I conclude my statement by emphasizing the relevance and timeliness of the report of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"". We believe that the content of this important document is a challenge to our generation and to the United Nations  since  if by national and international ""preventive diplomacy"" we succeed in attaining the following objective: ""To seek to identify at the earliest possible stage situations that could produce conflict  and to try through diplomacy to remove the sources of danger before violence results"" (A/47/277  para. 15). we shall have marked the real beginning of the new era  and future generations will indeed be grateful. "
"65",2815,"GRC",47,1992,"Allow me  first of all  to extend to you. Sir  the warmest congratulations of the Greek Government on your election to the presidency. Your personal qualities and diplomatic skill augur well for progress on the work of this session. Moreover  we are especially pleased to salute in your person the representative of a neighbouring country with which Greece maintains long-standing relations of close friendship. I also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Shihabi  for the effective manner in which he discharged his functions as President of the Assembly last year. Allow me also to point out how impressed the Greek Government is by the way the Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has been discharging his duties since he took office at the beginning of the year. We are absolutely certain that he will continue his work with the same dynamism and diplomatic dexterity  for the benefit of both the international community and this Organization  which has grown since the General Assembly last met a year ago. Let me also join other representatives in welcoming the new Members that have been admitted to the United Nations as independent States  namely Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The admission of these new Members is a renewed expression of the desire of our Organization to welcome in its midst all those States that undertake the commitment to adhere to the purposes and principles set out in the United Nations Charter. Earlier this week the Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom  in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Community  delivered a statement on behalf of its 12 Member States. My Government fully subscribes to the contents of that statement. Greece is firmly committed to  and fully supports  the process of European integration. We believe that the economic and political union we agreed on when we adopted the Maastricht Treaty last year will strengthen progress and enhance prosperity not only on the European continent  but also in all the countries the Community is trading with. Greece was among the first European countries to ratify the Maastricht Treaty  and we are happy that the French people as well ratified the Treaty at the referendum of last Sunday. Allow me to note that the ""yes"" vote in the Greek Parliament was overwhelming 286 positive votes out of a total of 300 deputies voting - and is indicative of the extraordinary degree of unanimity of the Greek people concerning the position of our country for a united Europe. I have the honour to stand before this Assembly as the representative of a nation that is now completing a year-long celebration marking 2 500 years since our ancestors first invented a form of government called in Greek demokratia. which in rough translation means ""rule by the people"": democracy  which was destined to become one of the most outstanding contributions of Greece to the collective heritage of mankind and a cornerstone of world civilization. We Greeks felt happy and  allow me to say  proud a year ago  as we saw democracy and its twin principle  freedom  gaining ground throughout the world and consolidating its presence in countries where totalitarianism had long held sway. In welcoming new members to the community of free nations  the Greek Government expressed the hope that the post-cold-war world would be based on the principles of democracy and freedom  on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  and on the rule of law. That hope was expressed a year ago. Can we now  a year later  ascertain the extent to which it has been met? Admittedly  a year's time is too short to allow a conclusive judgement  but the events of the last 12 months offer some evidence of the direction in which the world is moving. And  I must say  the evidence available is not as encouraging as our expectations were. In fact  we have witnessed developments that threaten the fragile positive trends we had begun to see. We have seen peoples that gained their freedom and independence taking the path of nationalism. Signs abound that we are entering a dangerous and unpredictable world situation  where conflicts  extreme nationalism and tensions of a new nature are erupting  and where the clash of interests could take the place of the ideological confrontations of which we have had bitter experience in the past. In spite of the comfort of being safe at last from the threat of nuclear annihilation since the recent enormous strides in disarmament  in some areas the world seems to be moving into a state of uncontrolled proliferation of conventional arms and civil strife. In some cases  that civil strife seems to be on the brink of spilling over and becoming a threat to regional and international peace and security. To make matters worse  the weak economies of many developing countries remain in the grip of a deepening crisis  while growing poverty  and in certain cases even hunger  is becoming a menace to recent gains in democracy. And the environment continues to deteriorate at an alarming pace. Faced with such a situation  the world community has to react collectively. And as it is the United Nations that embodies the collegiality of the world community  it is incumbent upon it to devise ways and means to help humanity deal with the situation. In this respect  the nations and the peoples of the world are fortunate in that  with the cold war behind us  the paralysis that had for a long time plagued our Organization has now disappeared. The United Nations is now indeed showing signs that it is willing to live up to the expectations placed in it. A series of actions is being undertaken to deal with the major problems confronting humanity now. In this context  earlier this year  the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  the largest summit ever held  met at Rio de Janeiro. Next year we will see the Second World Conference on Human Rights. In 1994  population and development will be dealt with. In 1995  the World Conference on Women will take place. Finally  a world summit for social development has been proposed. But the first in this series of actions was taken last January and directly concerned international peace and security. The Greek Government welcomed the convening of the Security Council at the summit level to reaffirm the world community's devotion to the principle of collective security and to  the settlement of disputes in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter  and to consider anew the means by which collective security can be upheld through the Organization. Greece has also welcomed the document entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  on preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping  issued by the Secretary-General in response to a request made by the members of the Security Council at their January summit meeting. I take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for a document of vision  lucidity and challenging ideas. We in the Greek Government have studied it with great interest and are looking forward to participating in the fruitful debates that are bound to follow in the various bodies of our Organization. We are pleased that the Secretary-General sees the concepts of preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping in their proper perspective within the larger concept of peace and security that goes beyond the military sphere and encompasses social and economic factors  primary among which is the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are also encouraged that the Secretary-General has not failed to emphasize the importance of democracy not only within nations but also among the family of nations. The perception of selectivity in the application of the principles of the Charter must be avoided if the moral authority of the United Nations is to be maintained. This is particularly urgent now that the enforcement capability of the Organization is being enhanced and put to use. Enforcement without moral authority is coercion and tyranny. Smaller nations need to be reassured that no Power will succeed in usurping the moral authority of the United Nations and using it for the advancement of its own interests.  It is the fervent hope of the Greek Government that the current turbulent situation will prove to be only a brief transition and will soon be replaced by a spirit of international cooperation and solidarity. The deployment of common efforts for the maintenance of international peace and security through preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping are an indispensable manifestation of such international solidarity. The other two foundations on which this solidarity must be based are respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and a common concern for the protection of the environment. The subject of human rights is  of course  not new. We rejoice that the European Community has time and again emphasized that respect for  and promotion and safeguarding of human rights is an essential element in international relations and  therefore  one of the cornerstones of cooperation and of relations between the Community and its member States and other countries. The expression of concern about human rights violations can no longer be considered mere interference in a State's internal affairs. Established principles governing relations among States - such as non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for the national sovereignty of States must accommodate efforts by the United Nations and by regional organizations to protect the human rights of individuals and social groups that are threatened in particular States. A few words about Greece's relations with its neighbours and the state of affairs in our region. We have repeatedly and officially stated that Greece has no territorial claims whatsoever against any of the countries neighbouring ours. We offer our friendship to all of them and we hope  indeed we are certain  they will reciprocate. We maintain the best possible relations with our Balkan as well as our Mediterranean neighbours. Regarding our relations with Turkey  we consider that it is of primary importance for Greece and our neighbour Turkey that our two countries display the necessary will and imagination to create a climate of mutual confidence  security and stability which will redound to the benefit of the Eastern Mediterranean in general and our two peoples in particular. Greece believes that it is high time for our two neighbouring States to find the way  on the basis of international law and international conventions and treaties  to establish closer relations  compatible with the requirements of the Charter of the United Nations  the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris  as well as with the expectations of our peoples  dictated by geographical proximity and by common interests. This intention  our political will and our sincere desire have been repeatedly stressed by our Prime Minister  Mr. Mitsotakis  who has already met with the Prime Minister of Turkey  Mr. Demirel  four times this year  while I have had the opportunity to speak in the same spirit to my Turkish counterpart  Mr. Hikmet Cetin  with whom I have already met three or four times. We  for our part  laid emphasis on the fact that the problem of Cyprus  which exercises a negative influence on our bilateral relations  should at last find a proper solution on the basis of all relevant United Nations resolutions.  I should like to remind the Assembly that despite coordinated efforts the problem remains unresolved. Cyprus continues to be divided and a large part of its territory is still under Turkish occupation. The other consequences of the 1974 invasion  such as those of the refugees  the missing persons  and the continuing efforts to change the demographic structure of the island and to plunder of Cyprus' cultural heritage  still exist and constitute the main elements of the tragic reality of this Mediterranean island  an integral part of the European family and a State Member of this Organization. In this respect  the report of the European Commission of Human Rights published on 2 April 1992 sets out the violations of human rights in Cyprus  concerning missing and displaced persons  separation of families  deprivation of possessions and so on. Despite the present status quo in Cyprus which the most recent Security Council resolution explicitly characterizes as not acceptable we  together with the international community  look forward to the systematic efforts of the Secretary-General with the active support of the five permanent members of the Security Council to bring about a just  a viable and a functional solution to the Cyprus problem. In this respect  we note that the Secretary-General's set of ideas  including the map attached thereto  which was initially discussed last July and August  with special emphasis on the territorial  refugee and property issues  should form the basis of negotiations during the follow-on talks scheduled to be resumed in New York in late October. We urge Turkey to use all its decisive influence on the Turkish-Cypriot side to ensure that it approaches the talks in a constructive manner which may well contribute to the solution of the problem and the elimination of a real anachronism in today's Europe. In conclusion on this subject  I wish to stress once again that the just settlement of this problem would greatly benefit relations between our two peoples and our two countries. Moreover  it would also constitute an important element of Turkey's aspirations to its European orientation. We have been trying  most emphatically  to make it clear that it is our will to establish the most friendly relations with our neighbour Turkey. I do not think that the international community would be proud if it were to leave this problem  which has been dragging on for over 18 years  unresolved. The situation in the Balkans remains a cause of major concern to all. The Yugoslav crisis continues to constitute a potential danger for destabilization of the whole Balkans and a danger for peace and security in the wider area. Greece  as a Balkan country  naturally is directly concerned and  therefore  from the very beginning of the crisis has not spared any effort to achieve a speedy and negotiated solution. The convening of the London Conference under the co-chairmanship of the European Community and the United Nations represents our only hope for a lasting settlement. We wish to reiterate here our full support to the chairmanship of the Conference  to which we are ready to offer all our assistance. The Assembly should send a clear message to all former Yugoslav parties that there can be no alternative to a negotiated solution of the crisis and that the international community is determined not to recognize any fait accompli created by force. We believe that no single party is to blame for the current crisis and its horrors and that all share part of the blame. In any event  we must act swiftly to stop the war before it is too late  for the dangers of spill-over of the crisis are real. Any form of military intervention in the former Yugoslavia is highly inadvisable. We have cautioned against it because we consider the staging of a war to stop another war absurd and self-defeating. Indeed  if a majority of other States were to decide on some form of military intervention in Yugoslavia  Greece would in no way participate. All States - and mainly Balkan States - that neighbour the former Yugoslavia  and all States with a special interest in the area  should in any case be excluded from such action. Otherwise  the enmities  the mistrust and the rekindling of bitter memories of the past will be a source of persistent bitterness and instability for generations to come. We want the Balkans to be an area of peace and we wish to avoid a return to the time when they were known as the powder-keg of Europe. We want good relations with all our Balkan neighbours. We are ready to support them economically and also to facilitate the development of their relations with the European Community. We have no claims against anybody and we expect them to have similar motivations toward us. It is for this reason that  as regards the former ""Yugoslav Federal Socialist Republic of Macedonia""  we have actively and consistently advocated full compliance with the Lisbon Declaration of the European Community  according to which that Republic should be recognized under a name which does not include the term ""Macedonia"". Otherwise  we will surely have sown the seeds of future tensions and conflicts in the area and we will have jeopardized the ability of the peoples of the Balkans to live and coexist peacefully together. Our insistence on this point is not only an emotional or sentimental matter  now is it only a matter of historical accuracy. It is  more than anything  a matter of political realism. The usurping of a Greek name and of ancient Greek emblems  combined with constitutional provisions insinuating territorial expansion  is nothing if not a clear indication of territorial claims. If we allow this policy to be pursued we shall condemn future generations for we shall be forming the nucleus of friction for some time to come. Having said that  I wish to make it quite clear that we have never harboured any enmity towards this nascent republic. Even when  recently  we reluctantly had to discontinue fuel exports there  in order to counter unjustified  unfounded accusations that Greece was circumventing Security Council resolutions 713 (1991) and 757 (1992)  we never interfered with the supply of food and humanitarian aid. As a matter of fact  exports of fuel supplies have already been resumed now that the European Community has adopted new regulations to ensure the movement of goods towards the former Yugoslavia that safeguard the effectiveness of the United Nations embargo. The arms embargo should also be reinforced with respect to all sides and an effective mechanism for its control should be put in place. Concerning Kosovo  which is a particularly sensitive  potentially dangerous area  we should encourage the Serbian Government and the ethnic Albanians to pursue a serious and open dialogue within the framework of the London Conference with a view to reaching an early solution to the problems of this area. We maintain that a status of autonomy  without any change of frontiers  would satisfy all concerned. The international community must also be alerted to the various reports from many parts of the former Yugoslavia concerning atrocities. It should be made clear to all those who are responsible for such acts that they will be held personally responsible. This is a point about which my Government feels particularly strongly. The easing of international tensions with the end of the cold war provides new possibilities and resources for development. Our immediate objective should be to restore growth that would not irreparably destroy the air  the rivers  the forests  the oceans or any other part of nature. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de Janeiro last June has raised high hopes that the consensus which has emerged and which strikes a balance between environment and development will be sustained. At the same time  we note with great satisfaction that a political consensus is growing concerning the fundamental relationship between pluralistic democracy  respect for human rights  and development as an equitable and sustainable process. Now that the end of the cold war has raised the hopes of millions  a system of collective security is envisaged to preserve world peace and stability and to provide a new vision of development very much along the lines of the Charter of the United Nations. Economic and social development is not possible without peace and stability  which are prerequisites and not substitutes for development. The last 18 months have witnessed profound historic changes in the world economy. A large part of the world remains in a state of transition and uncertainty while it is being transformed fundamentally. The Secretary-General has offered us a new concept of integrated development no longer based on the traditional strict differentiation among political  economic and social issues. In his introductory remarks to the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council  he argued in favour of an integrated approach to global issues under which the United Nations system  through preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping will bring its political influence to bear on the solution of economic and social issues. This approach is best suited to the Organization because it will secure ""a unit thrust"" in all the activities of the United nations system through enhanced coordination of agencies. The recently concluded Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de Janeiro is a first example of this approach. A conceptual bridge was crossed there. We hope that fundamental principles agreed on at Rio de Janeiro will be translated into concrete action. The world economic situation presents an uneven and variegated picture. In countries where there is a movement towards a market system  economic difficulties are increasing  exacerbated by new assertions of nationalism  as well as by ethnic and religious challenges  which threaten social peace and the cohesion of States. In the developing countries growth remains on the whole sluggish  while there has been great diversity in performance among them. Moreover  the problems which plagued the developing world in the 1980s still persist. As pointed out in the World Economic Survey. 1992. world production fell in 1991 for the first time since the Second World War  and the recovery that was beginning to take shape appeared to be exceptionally weak. The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) remains stalled. Financial assistance for development purposes is still hard to come by  while developing and other countries must complete painful adjustment programmes. High inflation  large-scale deficits  debt burdens and lack of adequate investments have not yet shown signs of improvement. Furthermore  economic hardship has given rise to fanaticism  unchecked migratory movements  civil strife and criminal acts. Development continues to be the most serious challenge of all countries. The world economic situation provides an opportunity for a strengthening of the role of the United Nations system as regards enhancing international cooperation for development. The important political changes of the last two years and the integrated nature of political  economic and social issues call for the United Nations to play a major role in shaping the directions of social and economic development. Progress in the regional conflicts that have been on the agenda of our Organization has again been uneven. Peace in the Middle East remains elusive. The most important element of the Middle East problem is the Arab-Israeli conflict. Two of the most ancient peoples in the world  each of which has made outstanding contributions to the common heritage of mankind  have for decades confronted each other  seemingly unwilling to accept for the other what each demands for itself  that is  the right to exist within safe and recognized borders  the right to a homeland  and the right to take charge of its own destiny. However  the events of the last 12 months seem to indicate that each side may now be prepared to accept for the other at least part of what it demands for itself. And this development  although in itself not sufficient for the solution to the conflict  does seem to justify the judgement that the chances for peace are better now than they were a year ago. I wish in this connection to pay tribute to the commitment and perseverance of the sponsors of the peace process launched in Madrid in October 1991  as well as to the wisdom and courage displayed by the parties directly involved. It is the fervent hope of the Greek Government that the new Israeli Government  as well as the Arab parties involved  will seize the opportunity to work together towards a comprehensive peace. No one can dispute today that apartheid is an unacceptable political system that has to be eradicated in all its forms and practical consequences. Furthermore  the international community and the main political leaders in South Africa are committed to the creation of a united  non-racial and democratic South African society through peaceful means and through negotiations involving all parties concerned. However  the recent wave of violence in South Africa  which claimed many innocent lives  seemed to pose a serious threat to the negotiating process  and to undermine the results achieved so far. Greece firmly believes that no effort should be spared to help South African society keep the momentum and to continue building upon what has been achieved. Let us bear in mind that  now more than ever  the new reality of intensified subregional  regional and international cooperation in the political and economic fields points to an important role for a new  democratic  united and non-racial South Africa. In the Horn of Africa  in Somalia  a human tragedy of almost unprecedented scale is unfolding. War  drought and the collapse of civil authority threaten the very existence of the country: the physical existence the lives of its people. Starvation has already claimed thousands of lives. We know  however  that the difficulties of the two regions I have just referred to are only part of a more complicated  multifaceted structural p problem faced by the whole continent of Africa in all fields of human activity. We have to give all possible help to the countries of Africa to solve their present problems and to undertake new efforts of cooperation and integration which will foster development  peace and stability. The Greek Government welcomes the positive results of the Helsinki summit of 1992 in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and attaches particular importance to the comprehensive nature of the CSCE process  which brings together the Governments and the peoples of Europe and those of the United States and Canada. The Helsinki follow-up meeting provided an important opportunity for discussions on the future role of the CSCE. In particular  the strengthening of its institutions is expected to increase the effectiveness of the CSCE in the prevention  management and peaceful settlement of disputes. The Concluding Document adopted at the summit characterizes the CSCE as a regional arrangement in the sense of the provisions of Chapter VIII of the United Nation Charter. In that way  the CSCE process contributes substantially to the collegiality of the world community and is therefore supported wholeheartedly by the Greek Government. Although the international community has increased its cooperation in combating drug abuse and the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotics  this scourge continues to plague and undermine our societies. Consequently  further intensified and more effective international cooperation is required within the existing international and regional mechanisms provided for by the United Nations and regional organizations. My country  which lies at the crossroads of the world  continues to be actively engaged in the fight against drugs. It is in the process of adopting new legislation and policies to enhance its effectiveness in combating the problem. Furthermore  we have increased our cooperation with all States of our region with a view to adopting and implementing effective practical measures against drug trafficking. In conclusion  I should like to reaffirm my country's commitment to the United Nations and to the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity it embodies. We join forces with the other nations of the world and pledge to make every possible effort for world peace and stability and for a humane international community  on an enduringly beautiful planet.

"66",2856,"GRD",47,1992,"It is with profound pleasure that my delegation conveys to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session the greetings and best wishes of the Government and people of Grenada. We wish to extend to you. Sir  warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. My delegation commends Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the excellent manner in which he conducted the business of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We take this opportunity also to extend congratulations to the new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and to commend him for the strong leadership he has brought to the United Nations and for the dedication with which he has carried out his duties since assuming office. The delegation of Grenada is delighted to welcome to the United Nations the 13 new Members: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The current world situation presents a scenario of unmistakable complexities. The end of the cold war  rapid democratization world wide  the emergence of new national sentiments  intolerance towards ethnic  religious and cultural differences and the formation of regional economic blocs have brought about a restructuring of programmes and a reordering of agendas locally  regionally and globally. Economic interests now appear to be given precedence in most  if not all  considerations. The proponents of those changes declare their objectives to be the creation of efficient and competitive production systems  free trade and  absolute freedom from control of market forces. But those objectives  though ostensibly neutral  are in fact heavily tilted in favour of the technologically advanced economies and insensitive to the capacities and priorities of the developing countries. That there are other equally important  even primary  objectives to be achieved by the less developed countries cannot be denied. Indeed  the market economy is being perfected  and the time is right for serious responses aimed at eradicating the conditions of poverty and deprivation that are so widespread in the modern world. That process must be activated with the urgent aim of ensuring that economic progress is buttressed by social equity  freedom from want  good health and education and the enjoyment of basic human rights. Those concerns will no doubt be addressed at the proposed World Summit for Social Development  which my Government is pleased to support. If we fail to develop strategies and programmes to address those problems  then the impending conditions of increased hunger  poverty and social deprivation can culminate in very serious global unrest and instability. Grenada is dealing with this new cold economic world at both the domestic and regional levels. I wish to make it clear that the Government and people of Grenada recognize and accept that the responsibility for the advancement of our country rests  first and foremost  squarely on our shoulders. Grenada has taken steps to restructure its economy in the face of severe fiscal deficits  which threatened to erode our credit-worthiness  deny us space for growth and development and pauperize our people. Our self-imposed structural adjustment programme has its social  political and other costs. However  my Government is convinced that with prudent management of our very limited resources  a willingness to sacrifice  firm and cohesive political leadership and external assistance  we will in due course restore our economic well-being and place our country on a sound growth path. My delegation is happy to report that some improvements have already been realized  and we look forward to achieving all the goals of our structural adjustment programme. Small countries  in particular small developing island countries with all the particular difficulties that development presents to them  can hardly compete in the world arena with developed countries. While demonstrating our determination to help ourselves  we appeal to donor countries to give renewed consideration to the difficulties confronting small developing island countries; and we appeal to the international community in general for the concessions we need to attain our development goals. As we meet at this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly  a number of small island States in the Caribbean  highly dependent on the banana industry  are faced with an uncaring call by certain countries to have bananas placed within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). My delegation submits that the outcome of such a campaign could wipe out the banana industry in our islands. The resulting social hardships and political instability are costs which will be ruinous to our societies. These situations can be avoided if present conditions continue to prevail. Grenada reiterates is appeal for flexibility on the banana issue and calls upon the pro-tariff lobby to relax its efforts. At this particular time in the history of the Caribbean region  we are seized of the urgency to organize our response to the new international order. Earlier this year  regional Governments received with pleasure the report of the West Indian Commission  which was mandated to examine the conditions of Caribbean societies and to make recommendations for preparing the region for the economic  political and social challenges of the twenty-first century. The report of the Commission was very inspiring. It points the region along certain beneficial paths  and Grenada looks forward to the full consideration of the Commission's recommendations by Caribbean heads of Government in the near future. The recently concluded United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) heralded a new beginning and was undoubtedly one of the most significant undertakings of the United Nations. My Government wishes to applaud Mr. Maurice Strong and the entire UNCED secretariat for the successful conclusion of that summit and to extend our congratulations to the Government of Brazil for successfully hosting the Conference. Its real achievements should become manifest over time through the implementation of the work plan on sustainable development. Agenda 21  which comprehensively addressed the critical indivisibility of development and concern for the environment. My Government is also pleased with the conventions on climate change and biological diversity which were opened for signature at the Rio summit. We look forward to an early implementation of both conventions. The Government of Grenada urges conscientious efforts to establish the mechanisms  strategies and the resource commitments agreed to. From the perspective of small island States in particular  this is an absolute necessity. Our overriding concern for the welfare of our people and the wholesomeness of our environment  in particular the fragile marine environment upon which we are heavily dependent  compels us to register a most vigorous protest against the planned shipment of tons of radioactive material through the Caribbean Sea later this month. The problems of illicit drug trafficking and money-laundering have now reached levels that no country is able to combat single-handedly. Indeed  the security and sovereign integrity of our State  the rule of law and the well-being of our economic and financial institutions demand that we persevere in this fight. My Government wishes to take advantage of this occasion to express its appreciation for the efforts undertaken by a number of developed countries to assist developing nations in the campaign against the drug trade. We appeal for increased multilateral support to institute comprehensive measures aimed at the reduction of demand  interdiction  the rehabilitation of victims  and appropriate punishment for the couriers of this particular form of death and destruction. It is distressing to note that  while progress has been made in the political sphere in terms of the peaceful resolution of certain conflicts and the abatement of ideological tensions  the nerves of the international community are being shaken by the situation in the Balkans  most specifically  by the evidence of what is being described as ""ethnic cleansing"". Recognizing that peace and stability are essential to the promotion of social progress  the Government of Grenada wishes to reaffirm its support for United Nations attempts to halt the fighting in Yugoslavia  and we call upon the international community to act in a concerted manner to put a stop to what could escalate into a larger and more intractable conflict. My Government continues to be keenly interested in the situation in South Africa. The persistent violence clearly threatens the negotiating process and delays the transition to a democratic South Africa. We are concerned that while strides have been made to dismantle the pillars of apartheid  greater efforts must be made to accelerate the pace of reforms  so as to enhance the climate for free political activity and genuine democracy. The Government of Grenada therefore welcomes recent positive signals pointing to the resumption of dialogue between the African National Congress and the Government of South Africa. My Government also welcomes the peace talks currently taking place among the key parties to the Middle East conflict and wishes to counsel continued dialogue and flexibility in order to bring lasting solutions to that region's problems. Over the last year  numerous initiatives to reinstate ousted Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide have been frustrated. Sanctions announced by the Organization of American States have not produced the anticipated results because of the evident unwillingness of some countries to enforce the measures. My Government wishes to reiterate its support for the return to power of the constitutionally elected Government of Haiti and calls upon the international community to continue to support the restoration of Haiti's democracy. The international community is now reasonably expecting greater United Nations involvement in the maintenance of global peace and security. At the same time  more attention and resources are expected to be focused on the economic  social  cultural and humanitarian needs of the developing countries. My delegation wishes to encourage greater efforts to realize the benefits of peace dividends and to channel them towards those needs. The Government of Grenada is cognizant of the challenging efforts at revitalization being undertaken throughout the United Nations system so as to increase efficiency and cost-effectiveness. We anticipate that this revitalization will emphasize the priorities of the countries most in need the developing countries. We are convinced that the regional economic commissions are in a good position to deal with a wide range of development issues and should thus be given greater autonomy in the implementation of regional programmes. The financial difficulties confronting the United Nations are of deep concern to Grenada  as I am sure they are to many Member States. We recognize the importance of a financially strong United Nations with the capacity to deal effectively with problems of an economic  social  cultural or humanitarian character  to promote peace  security  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. At the same time  it is true that many Governments are experiencing severe difficulties in meeting their primary financial obligations. It is hardly the time for additional commitments due to reckless causes and senseless conflicts. As we approach the end of the International Decade of Disabled Persons  we must acknowledge that too little has been done to enable disabled persons to see themselves as equal citizens. In this regard my Government takes this opportunity to encourage measures aimed at enhancing the fuller participation and welfare of disabled persons in their respective societies. Despite the tremendous amount of work to be done in order to build and consolidate democracy and improve the standard of living for peoples everywhere  Grenada believe that  with the collective efforts of all States and the purposeful involvement of the United Nations  our aspirations will be achieved.

"67",2903,"GTM",47,1992,"Allow me  Sir  to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session and to assure him that he will have the full cooperation of my delegation in the discharge of his important task. I should like also to congratulate Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia on the efficient manner in which he discharged his duties as President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I extend fraternal and cordial greetings to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who  as Secretary-General  has headed the Organization since the beginning of the year. We realize that during this initial stage he has had a difficult task. He has undertaken the job of restructuring and reforming the system to adapt the Organization to the new international context. In this joint effort  in which mankind has placed its highest hopes for a better and more just future  it is positive and comforting to have new friends in our midst. In that spirit  I extend the warmest welcome to the nations that joined the Organization this year. Guatemala offers them its friendship  respect  solidarity and cooperation. The nations of the world are gathered in this forum with mixed feelings of uncertainty and hope uncertainty because  following the dramatic changes in the international order  we find ourselves on the eve of a new era  whose fundamental features have yet to be defined; hope because  despite a history of sterile confrontations  an opportunity is opening up for a just and equitable international order in which cooperation between nations would be geared to the solution of the fundamental problems of the international community: extreme poverty  sustainable development  peace  security and the environment. We Guatemalans view these changes with great hope  and we fully understand their historic implications  as our country too is involved in a far-reaching and ambitious process of transformation  which we trust will positively change the course of our history. Guatemala is making great efforts to overcome the confrontation that  for years  has riven our society and afflicted thousands of Guatemalan families. Others took advantage of the problems of our political and economic development to transplant their hostilities to our soil. Therefore  for more than 30 years our country was involved in foreign and alien confrontation that left only suffering in its wake and led to neglect of the central problems of our society. As a small country  Guatemala suffered from the ups and downs of an international system based on ideological confrontation. As was the case on a world-wide scale  economic resources necessary to give impetus to the process of our people's socio-economic well-being were earmarked to finance a sterile and cruel confrontation. The attention of the various sectors of our society was distracted from genuine questions of development and obfuscated by an ideological polemic whose outcome was violence and stagnation. Problems of hunger  education  social well-being  health and poverty are among those that were left unattended and unsolved throughout these irretrievably lost decades. The whole Central American region found itself in a similar situation so much so that it became the focus of international attention as a result of internal armed clashes and military tensions. As a region  however  we have been able to take our historic destiny in hand and  by an approach that we ourselves designed  often in the face of the scepticism of people who thought us unable to solve our problems other than on the basis of external formulas  have managed to overcome the spiral of violence and  at the same time  initiate a process of democratization and pacification  which is now bearing fruit and is transforming our nations with the promise of a better future for our peoples. As Central Americans  we Guatemalans are aware that the challenge of our future is entirely in our own hands. The process of democratization  begun some years ago  is the start of a much broader process one aimed at transforming our social  economic and cultural structures and at securing the well-being of all Guatemalans. The effort that is needed to generate a process of overall improvement in the standards of living of our people requires that the funds used for armed confrontation be reallocated for social investment. President Serrano Elias Lanzo  at the beginning of his administration in 1991  launched a peace plan for the whole nation  conscious of the fact that progress towards democratization of the country is the only means of achieving even higher goals. Under this plan  peace is conceived of as a source of the basic conditions that will allow for the harmonious development of the individual in society and for peaceful and respectful coexistence between people  rather than simply as the absence of violence or the ending of internal armed confrontation. In this framework  the Government of the Republic has begun a dialogue with the URNG with the air.i of securing an end to the internal conflict and of involving the groups taking part in it so that  within the constitutional framework of the State's laws  they will renounce the use of arms and participate in the political life of the country in a constructive rather than a destructive manner. Unfortunately  the pace of the initial talks was slowed by unconstructive attitudes on the part of the representatives of the insurgents  attitudes that can be understood only as an attempt artificially to delay the peace process and thus to gain special benefits not justified by the realities on the ground. The Government's goodwill has been shown by its acceptance of an agreement on human rights proposed by the conciliator who presides over the National Commission for the Reconciliation of Guatemala. The insurgents have not accepted this proposal. The Government of Guatemala deplores and rejects this delaying approach which results in unnecessary prolongation of the sufferings of Guatemalans and limits the possibilities of action by the Government to deal with the real problems of the people who elected it. We appeal to the international community to condemn these delaying tactics  support the continuation of negotiations and appeal to the insurgents to adopt a positive and realistic attitude. The Government of the Republic trusts that in the next meetings with the mediation of the Conciliator and the participation of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  these obstacles will be overcome and the talks will continue in order soon to reach the complete peace for which all Guatemalans yearn. The transformation of Guatemalan society  however  goes well beyond putting an end to internal armed confrontation. For this reason my Government has developed important initiatives aimed at substantively modifying some of the structures of our society. Central to these efforts is the decision to put on a solid footing a State where the rule of law is paramount  guaranteeing the effective administration of justice for all citizens  without discrimination. A renewed and revitalized State under the rule of law  guaranteeing fully effective human rights  is the central aim of the Administration of President Serrano Elias. In that context  important achievements have been made  perhaps the most important being the restoration  through a struggle against impunity  of the individual's trust in democratic institutions. The Government is aware that much remains to be done in order to ensure fully effective human rights  but we believe that it must be recognized that over the past two years important advances have been made in this respect. At the same time  significant efforts are being made to create conditions that will permit the return to their homeland of refugees who have gone to other countries  fleeing the violence that affected their population groups in the past. The National Peace Fund (FONAPAZ) and the National Land Fund (FONATIERRA)  both created by the present Government  are participating jointly with the Special Commission for Refugees  Returnees and Displaced Persons (CEAR) in creating conditions appropriate not only for the return of refugees but also for the effective reintegration of returnees and displaced persons into society  providing them with conditions to engage in productive activity that will allow for their social and human development. I have taken the liberty of drawing attention to some of the important aspects of my country's internal politics in order to give the background to the points that I shall now make concerning the international scene and our foreign policy. Guatemala has followed with close attention the important world developments of recent years. We are certainly witnessing the formation of a new international order  which springs from the ashes of a confrontational and bipolar world. We should take advantage of the new international environment to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts and confrontations that still persist  and thus allow the Governments concerned to apply to development and peace resources formerly earmarked for financing those confrontations. At the same time the dividends of world peace should be channelled to investment for the social well-being of peoples. Nuclear disarmament  a major goal in itself  should also be used to generate a surplus with which to finance programmes to resolve the most serious world problems hunger  disease  illiteracy and poverty. The new climate of confidence among nations and new patterns of global security should be based not only on an absence of immediate military threats  but on real efforts to resolve the central problems of mankind. More than ever before  we have a historic opportunity today to make significant advances towards the creation of a truly just world order  based on cooperation  not domination. To achieve this  however  we need above all to recognize the errors affecting the international system and to establish new rules permitting truly harmonious coexistence. It is necessary to carry out promptly an exhaustive  in-depth revision of relations between the developed and the developing nations. There are enormous imbalances which if present trends continue will lead to a deepening gap between the two. The industrialized countries and the developing countries must jointly agree on an agenda of matters that should be given priority attention by the international community and discuss and explore machinery and methods that will allow us better to face the challenge of development in all its aspects. The World Summit for Social Development gives us the opportunity to discuss these problems at the highest level. Multilateralism has taken on a renewed and vigorous impetus in the task of building a new world order. The importance of multilateral forums as centres of discussion  analysis and the adoption of generalized policies for the international system is a significant opportunity for developing nations to participate actively in the process of constituting the new rules of the international system. The experience gained in organizing approaches that allowed us to formulate proposals and present our interests to the industrialized nations  at a time when ideological confrontation relegated our countries' fundamental problems to the background  should be used to advantage today to ensure that the international agenda suitably reflects our interests and needs. However  those interests and perspectives will be reflected in international forums only to the degree that we fight for it. To that end  South-South cooperation is a fundamental vehicle and the efforts to achieve coordination between developing nations should be stepped up. In Guatemala's view  the world order that emerges from the transformations under way should be built upon deep respect for the norms and principles of international law. The possibility of harmonious  stable coexistence between the nations of the world depends on unconditional respect for States' sovereignty  independence and equality before the law. Therefore  the international community must reject any State's attempt to extend the application of its own law5 beyond its own borders. Within the context of the emerging world order  encouraging efforts are now under way to reach a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict. Those encouraging deeds are in contrast to the tragic events taking place in the former Yugoslavia and the equally tragic situation prevailing in Somalia. The international community must renew its efforts to find peaceful  negotiated solutions in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. My country has viewed with great interest the measures taken by the Secretary-General to adapt the United Nations for the better fulfilment of its functions  and we support all efforts that enable the Organization to attain the objectives of the Charter. In particular  I wish to emphasize the active role the Organization has taken in peace-keeping in various regions of the world. In the resolution of conflicts that originated before the end of the cold war and in cases of new tensions emerging from the geopolitical processes resulting from that historic development  the peace-keeping forces under the flag of the United Nations carry out a fundamental role by opening the way to truce  dialogue and negotiation  thus preventing the prolongation of confrontations that can be satisfactorily resolved by peaceful means. We should  however  re-examine the criteria used in financing those forces. The cost of peace-keeping operations could prove overwhelming for both the Organization and its Member States  especially those  like Guatemala  that have limited resources. In this regard  we welcome the Secretary-General's report ""An Agenda for Peace"" as a contribution to those efforts. Along the same lines  there is no doubt about the need to reform structures that emerged and functioned within the framework of a confrontational order. Such reform should not be limited  however  to the mere streamlining of the bureaucracy  but should aspire to the creation of a system that ensures satisfactory representation for all its members. As part of those efforts  we should deal without delay with the composition of the Security Council of the Organization. The current structure and procedures of the Council are the result of a political order that we have left far behind  and we need to revise them  adapt them to the current situation and prevent the creation of patterns of political tutelage that go against the principles of equitable participation and juridical equality among States. In fact  a new problem is beginning to take shape within the structure of the Organization  and it is nothing more or less than the reflection of a global issue: the privileged position enjoyed by some nations encourages monopolistic structures in various multilateral forums. The United Nations will be an effective and efficient forum to the extent that each and every one of its Members can feel that its interests are adequately represented in the policies and programmes of the various departments of the Organization. Attitudes of political and economic tutelage will be very unlikely to strengthen it; nor will they facilitate the establishment of international patterns of cooperation. We believe that in the protection and promotion of human rights we have a clear example of such a situation. At this time Guatemala has the advisory services of an expert adviser from the United Nations  who has received a broad mandate from the Commission on Human Rights to assist my country in its efforts to achieve the full realization of human rights. The mandate has been accepted by my Government in the spirit of openness and cooperation that it has maintained in dealing with the Commission. In addition  my country also unreservedly supports the United Nations objective of promoting those rights internationally and will continue to cooperate with all its organs in that task. At the same time  we feel we must express our concern at what we see as the application of apparently selective criteria by some members of the Commission on Human Rights in its work. Nevertheless  disturbing phenomena such as xenophobia  racism  discrimination against migrant workers and ethnic and religious discrimination  which have become more acute in recent years in certain nations as a result of the changing international system  have not been given sufficient attention by the Committee during its recent deliberations. From the work of the Commission on Human Rights and the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities  it would appear that it is only in some developing countries that one finds obstacles to the full application of human rights  disregarding the serious problems that exist in other nations. In both of these forums  it would appear that the credibility of democratic  freely elected Governments is being questioned  giving greater validity to the arguments presented by politically compromised organizations that favor sectarian movements which seek  through the use of force and by causing suffering to peoples  to alter lawful democratic institutions. It is urgent and necessary that the Committee dealing with Non-Governmental Organizations engage in a review of the non-governmental organizations that cooperate in the work of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and that participate in particular in the work of the Commission on Human Rights  in order to ensure that their participation is positive and does not answer to sectarian political interests that might tend to discredit them. At the same time  it is necessary to review the working procedures of both forums so that organizations that participate as observers will not receive preferential treatment over that of members of the Organization who are not on the Committee. The Government of Guatemala will continue to cooperate with the United Nations in the field of human rights  and we hope in this respect to continue to receive the advisory services that enable the Government to fulfil the commitment of President Serrano Elias to promote the full enjoyment of human rights in our country. However  I appeal to the relevant organizations to guard against abuse of this spirit of openness and cooperation by groups seeking the destabilization of the State  an unjust and selective situation that would ultimately oblige the Government to review  analyse and reformulate its position on these matters. The World Conference on Human Rights  to be held next year  should provide an opportunity to examine the present situation and to plan the Organization's future policies in a matter that is of pivotal importance to the well-being of humankind. We are in the process of analysing  proposing and establishing a new world order based on cooperation and coexistence. The new role that falls to the United Nations implies growing functions of coordination and discussion between nations. To that end  the principle of universality should prevail over other interests. In this context  the Republic of China (Taiwan)  one of the largest economies in the world  is in a position to contribute significantly to seeking solutions to problems that nations of the world must face. Its presence in the United Nations would strengthen our Organization and permit more appropriate treatment of topics with global implications  such as that of the environment. Consequently  Guatemala appeals for consideration of the need for participation by the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a Member of our Organization  in addition to the People's Republic of China. We believe  moreover  that this attitude would make a suitable contribution to the spirit of cooperation and conciliation that should characterize the new world order. The structural reform undertaken by my Government includes a strategy for economic openness designed to bring our economy into the flow of international commerce. In addition to the effort at integration in the Central American region  which we support with deep conviction and whose aim is to shape a community of nations in the Central American isthmus  Guatemala at this time is also negotiating its participation in various regional economic-integration programmes. This strategy is in line with our conviction that more active and open participation in the international market is a central element in achieving economic growth and development for our population. We have signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the belief that eliminating barriers to international trade creates better opportunities for our economies. However  we are concerned by the fact that the liberalizing theories originating in the industrialized nations are giving way to clearly protectionist attitudes precisely at a time when our products are becoming competitive in their markets. Rules and regulations are emerging as an excuse to prevent the inflow of commodities and manufactured products  upon which our countries' economies largely depend. These attitudes can hardly provide a stimulus to trust and understanding  and they also give rise to questions about the sincerity of principles that are publicly proclaimed but only partially practised. However  we should not be thought of as ingenuous. We are aware of the fact that every country will promote its particular interests to the extent allowed by other nations. We are convinced  however  that for the sake of higher and more long-term interests  nations must set aside some of their more immediate and narrow interests. That concession should be general and reciprocal  however; otherwise dialogue becomes but a theoretical and sterile exercise. The activity of our Organization and the contribution that Member States make to its work are aimed at improving the quality of life and promoting the overall development of human beings. That makes it imperative that we strengthen the mechanisms of cooperation among nations. This session of the General Assembly is being held on the eve of a new era in international relations  whose principal features are yet to be defined. I express the hope that we  the participants in the Assembly  will prove equal to the challenge posed by the future peaceful coexistence and well-being for all mankind. "
"68",2992,"HND",47,1992,"I wish to convey to Mr. Ganev the most sincere congratulations of the Government of Honduras on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Through him we should also like to extend our best wishes to the Bulgarian people  who  like other peoples of Eastern Europe  are today  after much effort and self-sacrifice  helping to keep alive the flame of freedom  democracy and progress in that continent. To the new Members of our Organization  we extend a most cordial greeting. We are fully convinced that through the United Nations we shall be able to establish growing links of friendship and cooperation. Our Organization is grounded on principles of equality  shared responsibilities  and the promotion of international peace and security. We hope that Serbia and Montenegro will best achieve those objectives by meeting the legitimate expectations of the international community that an end will be put to the war  persecution and intolerance in the countries of former Yugoslavia  and that they will be able to become Members of this great family of nations. Moreover  in a world of changing realities  one which is none the less marked by its attachment to universality and peaceful coexistence  my Government  like other Central American countries  believes that we should open the way for the Republic of China  with more than 20 million inhabitants and authorities established in Taipei  to participate in the work of our Organization and its specialized agencies as that country does in various regional forums and international mechanisms. Membership in the United Nations does not constitute diplomatic recognition of sovereignty  and there have been and are precedents in the history of the United Nations for the simultaneous presence of countries which are in search of their historical  unity but which  while they remain separated  have not been denied the opportunity to make their contribution to the complex fabric of international relations and obligations which bring together the peoples of the Earth through the United Nations. We are beginning a new era in the life of this Organization. For us  the ""Agenda for Peace"" of our distinguished Secretary-General is a noteworthy effort embodying both vision and realism that will enable us to make progress in forging a more secure and prosperous world. The Government of Honduras warmly supports the proposals on preventive diplomacy and on strengthening the logistical and financial capacity of the United Nations for peace-keeping and for peace-building when peace is threatened  when peace has been breached  or when the persistence of situations of confrontation make peace vulnerable. In accordance with those aims  Honduras also urges greater support for and use of the international organs for the legal settlement of disputes such as the International Court of Justice  which has only recently handed down a judgment providing a definitive solution to a long-standing border dispute between El Salvador and Honduras. The peoples and Governments of both countries intend to comply in good faith with this judgement. Honduras has also decided to lend its armed forces and police for peace-keeping missions and is at present satisfactorily participating in the conciliation mission in Western Sahara of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO). With the end of a bipolar world and of the cold war  the terrible threat of a nuclear holocaust has dissipated. However  atomic weapons and other powerful weapons of mass destruction continue to overfill the arsenals of large and medium-sized Powers. My country therefore urges those who possess nuclear weapons to pursue  and as appropriate to initiate  serious and verifiable programmes for the reduction and destruction of such weapons  and the dismantling of possible vehicles for them. We also urge that the non-proliferation Treaty system be made more general and strengthened  with guarantees of verification; this applies also to the regional systems such as the Treaty of Tlatelolco. We shall also join in the broad movement that is being generated at this session towards seeking and achieving the prohibition of the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. In the Persian Gulf  the reasons for the vigorous response by the international community in defence of the sovereignty and legitimate rights of Kuwait still exist in several respects. More than ever before  the United Nations should redouble its efforts to bring about faithful compliance with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council ensuring an end to threats of aggression and guaranteeing for the countries of the Gulf an environment of peace and a future free of coercion and uncertainty. In the Middle East  in southern Africa and in Cambodia  processes of peace and reconciliation continue to move forward. Candidly acknowledging past injustices  trusting in the mediating efforts of the United Nations  and convinced that the fruits of peace are beneficial to their populations  the leaders of all the parties involved in these conflicts should now more than ever before strive to bring about equitable solutions to the differences that separate them  in order to guarantee a speedy restoration in their respective regions of stable and secure conditions of good neighbourliness. The signing of the Chapultepec Peace Agreements in January this year between the Government of El Salvador and representatives from the insurgent The President returned to the Chair. movement has brought an end to armed confrontation in our neighbouring country and has opened the way for a complete reconciliation in the spirit of freedom and democracy for the Salvadorian people. Honduras associated itself in the well-deserved tribute paid to former Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar for his mediating efforts. We have given and shall continue to give our full support to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in the fulfilment of the various stages of the peace agreement  including demobilization of formerly opposed forces and integration into civil and political life of the insurgents in a framework of complete legality. With peace in El Salvador  Central America  under the sign of democracy  is returning to the path of integration and development. Our countries are aware of the countless challenges posed by the insufficiency of our productive infrastructure  poverty and inequalities. But we also know that with dedication and vision  and especially with unity  we shall be able to overcome them. That is why the Tegucigalpa Protocol (A/46/829  annex III) of 13 December 1991 has entered into force  establishing a system for Central America integration which  working in the summit meetings of Presidents of the Central American isthmus  will impart force and impetus to a broad movement towards integration. Honduras hopes that the ever-stronger voice of Central America will be heard and that our region  a region of peace  democracy  freedom and development  will join and participate actively in the new forms of global interdependence that are taking shape on the eve of a new millennium.  For Honduras  an essential part of this integrated vision is the formation and implementation of national  regional and international strategies to fight poverty and to overcome long-standing problems that strike hardest at children  women and the elderly. If we justly aspire to economic development  and to growing expansion of trade in goods and services originating from all continents  we should likewise aspire to  and indeed make possible  real improvement in the quality of life of the inhabitants of our countries. Enhanced social well being should not be conceived of as a generous remedy that may prove insufficient to the communities receiving it  but rather as a joint undertaking to facilitate  through international cooperation  conditions for vocational training and better access to the opportunities that can be provided by open and growing economies. On 12 December 1991  in Central America  the Heads of State and Government of the seven countries of the isthmus assumed that very commitment  and  in the presence of various distinguished figures and executives of the United Nations and regional organizations  initiated a coordinated programme of human development with goals  objectives and resources defined for the present decade to culminate in the year 2000. Those initiatives of our subregion are universal in conception. That is why Honduras  like Chile and other friendly countries  will continue to give impetus to  and participate in  the appropriate preparations for and holding of a world conference on social and human development that may serve as a forum for reflection and initiatives to effectively set in motion international measures and policies in this respect. In an ever more integrated world  our countries  which share not only a rich cultural heritage exemplified by the common use of a single language  but also a democratic and modern vision of international relations  are naturally seeking to strengthen our links of fraternal friendship and our presence in the world. Those are the fundamental reasons that led us to constitute the Ibero-American Conference  which  following its founding declaration in Guadalajara  signed in July 1991 by the Heads of State and Government of the Hispanic-American countries  Brazil  Spain and Portugal  has now formally been constituted. Within the Ibero-American Conference  as a mechanism for interaction and cooperation  we have been designing programmes of mutual benefit primarily in the fields of education  exchanges of programmes via satellite  the creation of an indigenous fund and the launching of a broad programme of exchanges of scholars and researchers. The Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Madrid this year also gave support to growing and leading involvement by our countries in a world programme of human development. Maintenance of an open multilateral trading system is of vital importance to the expansion of world trade and the economic development of all countries. For that reason we must join our efforts to bring about the speedy culmination  on satisfactory terms  of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Stagnation of the negotiating process would have very serious consequences for world trade and would affect prospects and the structural programmes that many developing countries have undertaken at the cost of great sacrifice to find our proper place in the trend towards large trading blocs. This year there has been a dramatic fall in the prices of commodities essential to our economies. This leads us to stress the need to bring about better regulation of conditions of access guaranteeing the growth of sales of our competitive products at fair prices. In this context we must also  in our judgement  strengthen the transfer of technology for industrial development and more flexible terms in financing the modernization of industrial plant in developing countries. The urgent need to share responsibilities and to act together to guarantee global economic stability independently of the economic and political power of each nation  together with the growing convergence of views as to global priorities  were clearly and positively demonstrated at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro. The Government of Honduras takes great satisfaction from the common reflection on urgent environmental problems initiated at that conference  and we reiterate our support for the principles adopted by it and for Agenda 21  which comprehensively encompasses a whole programme of action in the environmental sphere and for sustainable development. We must persevere in this direction. The deterioration of nature must be halted. Together we can design conservation strategies that allow for the rational use of natural resources to meet the needs of employment and the economic growth of our populations. The new strategy of peace is also necessarily a new strategy of development. Only by growing together can we survive; only by pooling our efforts can we secure for future generations a better world in harmony and concord. "
"69",3016,"HRV",47,1992,"It was exactly four months ago that for the first time I had the honour of addressing you  the representatives of sovereign States members of the global community  in our common House  the General Assembly of the United Nations. Membership in the United Nations is the crowning international confirmation of the sovereign statehood of a State  (spoke in English) To the Republic of Croatia it meant the final realization of the just aspiration of the Croatian people to self-determination and freedom  which that people although one of the oldest European nations succeeded in regaining only after nine centuries of life in multinational state communities in which  to be sure  they preserved their national identity and the identity of their state but did not enjoy internationally recognized sovereignty. The creation of our independent State was the outcome of the indestructible moral strength of the Croatian people  based on a firm national awareness that has burned for centuries as an eternal fire in our hearts. A  nation may have existed from time immemorial  but if it lacks the moral strength and an awareness of its unique individual being  of its nationhood and statehood  it will disappear from the stage of world history. The Croatian people yearned for their State and rallied to achieve it. In their relatively long history from the seventh century to this very day the Croatian people have taken pride in authentic testimony in stone and in the written word to their existence and to their unquenchable yearning for freedom and for their own place among the nations of the world. It was in that very spirit that the great seventeenth-century Croatian poet Ivan Gundulid wrote in his city of Dubrovnik  that jewel of the heritage of Croatia and the world which in our time has suffered barbaric destruction his ode to freedom  which starts with the following lines: ""O liiepa  o draoa. o slatka slobodo . Par u kom sva blaga vis'n-ii nam Bog je do ..."" Those verses express the eternal faith in freedom that has been granted us as a supreme gift by the Almighty  a gift man has cherished  lived for and died for since time immemorial  as an independent  cultured and civilized being not only as an individual  but also as a member of his people and of mankind as a whole. Just as the individual wants to live as a free  rational and unique being  a people can be recognized and appreciated only if it is aware of itself and of its uniqueness in the world. The Croatian people had their own independent kingdom in the Middle Ages. Today they have again achieved full State sovereignty  demonstrating to the world their deep faith in and allegiance to freedom  their respect for justice  and their wish for peace and the development of their State within the international community of peace-loving  equal and independent States.  When it joined the United Nations the Republic of Croatia solemnly committed itself to respect the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and the system of values and undertakings on which the global community is based. On this occasion  let me once again solemnly reiterate our profound allegiance to the principles of the United Nations. We are faced with the historical responsibility to establish a new international order  an order of equality and the protection of the rights of all States and nations  national minorities and individuals. At the same time  this poses the challenge of building a world without war  a world with a healthy environment  a world of progress for all the inhabitants of the Earth. For the first time in the history of mankind  the conditions have been created for achieving those noble goals. After the disintegration of the colonial empires following the Second World War  and after the appearance of new nations capable of forming States but also of so-called ahistorical nations on the global scene  we have finally seen the end of division into blocs and the collapse of numerous despotic regimes throughout the world. Obviously and by no means accidentally the collapse of such regimes has been associated and has coincided with the collapse of some multinational States in which nations were held together through repression by totalitarian regimes or through domination by single nations. Human society has entered a period in its historical development of the overall integration of civilizations  but also of national individualization. In other words  the world has become immeasurably interdependent in terms of development  technology  transport  ecology  culture and the exchange of information  but the number of independent international entities has been increasing continuously. Reconciling this contradiction imposes the necessity to seek mediation  and even the firm involvement of the entire international community  to resolve outstanding and new local and regional crises.  Over the past two-year period  in which Croatia gained its sovereignty  the United Nations has reaffirmed its fundamental principles and tenets: peace and democracy as the foundations of international relations. This Organization has resolutely and efficiently opposed attempts to resolve international disputes by force or to infringe  through aggressive wars and the provocation of regional crises  on the right of nations to self-determination and on the territorial integrity of sovereign members of the international community. The determined military action in the Gulf war and the peace operations in Croatia  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Cambodia are effective proof that the United Nations  with its active role  is becoming increasingly capable of countering aggression and of bringing about peace. However  the experience acquired by the United Nations through peacemaking and peace-keeping operations and in controlling aggression indicates that the process of international agreement and the achievement of consensus in the initiation of peace operations is still slow and is not efficient enough. The Republic of Croatia welcomes and fully supports the activities so far undertaken by the United Nations to extinguish crises throughout the world  aware of the fact that a passive attitude or compromise towards the exponents of aggression and a new deterioration in international relations would be much more costly and involve substantially greater loss of human life and suffering. Nevertheless  it is the view of the Republic of Croatia that the future international peace-keeping activity of the United Nations will have to be expanded to include adequate preventive diplomacy  peacemaking efforts and post-war confidence building  precisely in order to keep human suffering and the danger of the spread of aggression to a minimum. Moreover  the Republic of Croatia perceives the need to channel the immediate future involvement of the international community  and thereby the programmes of the United Nations  along the following main lines of activity. First  the global economy must pull itself out of the deepening recession  and then an accelerated development cycle should be promoted  involving a higher degree of coordination and economic cooperation between the developed North and the developing countries. Our generation and the global community would bear a heavy responsibility to posterity if they permitted the recently ended opposition of East and West to be replaced by new barriers and a lack of trust between the industrially developed West and North and the third world. Secondly  an equally important task of the United Nations concerns the persistent and firm promotion of democratic freedoms and human rights throughout the world. This is a necessity because economic and overall development can no longer even be imagined  much less realized  merely on the basis of economic categories and criteria; it can be brought about only with the parallel establishment of human rights and a democratic order encompassing political liberties and social rights alike. In this respect  Croatia welcomes the decision to convene the World Conference on Human Rights in September next year. Croatia will actively contribute to the preparations for this important - I should say ""historic"" meeting  first by resolutely strengthening democratic institutions in our own country  which has only recently got rid of its totalitarian regime and alien domination. Moreover  within the scope of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)  Croatia has offered to host the CSCE seminar on minority problems which  we hope  will be held in the historic setting of Brijuni Island next May. The Republic of Croatia resolutely endorses the conclusions of the Rio Summit  convinced that sustainable development is the proper answer to the requirements of the global community and to the environmental balance of our planet. The protection of the environment is an important strategic issue in Croatia's long-term development. The Gulf war and the war operations in the former Yugoslavia have posed major threats to ecological systems. Because of this  the protection of the environment is not only a developmental issue  but also a major political and security issue. Last but not least  the future activity of the international community and of the United Nations should also be focused on in addition to the effective prevention of aggression as a means to settle international differences eliminating all sources of crises world-wide in order to establish a permanent and just peace. This complex task will involve a painstaking process of agreement and reconciliation of objectively differing views and interests  taking due account of the limited resources of the international community. However  the stakes and anticipated results for the entire international community are so great and historically far-reaching that they deserve every possible effort and the use of all resources in order to achieve humanity's supreme goal: permanent peace and general welfare in a stable international order. The role of the United Nations has been  and will remain  irreplaceable in ensuring the rights of nations to self-determination and the civil and human rights of ethnic communities and minorities. The United Nations can and must play an important role in controlling changes in societies that are ridding themselves of totalitarian systems on their way to democratic political and economic transformation. In line with such ideas  Croatia has already enacted - in wartime conditions  and in spite of the aggression waged by the Yugo-communist army and Serbia and Montenegro and of the externally incited revolt of part of the Serbian population in its territory a constitutional law on the protection of minorities that is more liberal than many similar pieces of legislation anywhere in the world. Croatia is prepared to contribute actively to the development of an international code and standard for the protection of the rights of ethnic communities and national minorities  to be used as guidelines in the development of national legislation and rules for the settlement of future controversies. We support enhancement of the role of the General Assembly as a global advisory parliament and of the Security Council as the body most responsible for international peace and security. This implies a higher responsibility for the members of the Security Council  and the permanent members in particular. We therefore support the initiative to expand the Security Council with new permanent members  because this would reflect the new global reality and allow for more harmonious regional representation. We also believe that the role of the Economic and Social Council in the solution of problems within its sphere of competence should be strengthened. Let me take this opportunity to stress in particular that Croatia fully agrees with the statement of the Secretary-General on regional conflicts as o threat to global peace and progress  made at the Department of Public Information's Annual Conference for Non-governmental Organizations  on 9 September. The regional conflicts of our time are no longer comparable to those of the cold war  when the warring sides represented conflicting ideologies. Present-day regional conflicts are the expression of purely imperialist or conquest-minded policies. They are not only the cause of terrible tragedy - because of the casualties suffered predominantly by the civilian population  the destruction of property and the displacement of people from their homes but also a threat to peace in a wider area  and even globally. Although one of the main principles of the United Nations Charter entails non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign States  many current conflicts occurring within the borders of particular States have shown that such developments should become the concern of the United Nations when general human principles are violated and international peace is threatened. As the Secretary-General has stated with a profound feeling of moral responsibility  it is the duty of the United Nations to support the dignity of human beings and to ensure the safety of their lives  regardless of the type of conflict  be it general  regional or confined to a specific country. When chaos within a State threatens to bring down civilized and democratic order  when tyranny crosses the boundaries set by moral standards accepted by humankind  and when a regional conflict may jeopardize the foundations of international order  peace and security  the United Nations must be able to take action. Most States  if not the entire international community  are also threatened when the existence of a single United Nations Member is placed in jeopardy. The examples of Cambodia  Somalia and  unfortunately  Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina suffice to confirm the correctness of this view. Let me remind the Assembly of the contribution of the struggle of the Croatian people for freedom to the establishment of the rights of small nations  to the collapse of totalitarian regimes and to a new democratic atmosphere in international relations in central and south-eastern Europe. The awakened-national awareness of east and central European nations made the major contribution to the dissolution of the totalitarian communist system. Their struggle against communist socialism  particularly in multinational State communities  was a struggle for national emancipation and for civil rights. Initially it was mistakenly understood  and  in some cases even today it is mistakenly understood  as retrograde nationalism or autarchic separatism  or has simply been put down as ethnic conflict and struggle for power. The processes of regional and worldwide integration on the one hand and the disintegration of multinational States on the other are only seemingly at odds. The newly emerged States in the area of the former Yugoslavia or the former Soviet Union do not aspire to autarchy. It is precisely such countries that most require purposeful integration and openness to cooperation. However  within the new post-communist democratic atmosphere small nations want to preserve their own identity and the right to their own States so that they may be subjects  and not objects  within the scope of the epoch-making changes taking place in the modern world. At the very beginning of the national and political emancipation of the Croatian people we were aware of the complexities and possible risks underlying the collapse of the past regime within a multinational State community. Therefore  we patiently tried to resolve the crisis of the former Yugoslav federation by political negotiation and by proposing a confederal agreement in order to avoid war. From the very"" beginning we supported the internationalization of the crisis  and by such an approach we have succeeded in turning international democratic public opinion to our advantage. Today  having achieved military and moral victory in the war that was forced upon our country  we are still ready for a political solution of all internal and international problems in order that the conditions necessary for permanent internal and regional stability and cooperation between the newly emerged States may be created. The recent just struggle of the Croatian and other peoples for their sovereignty has contributed to the development of a different attitude towards the rights of small nations to independence and to their own States. This unequal struggle has  in fact  affirmed the superiority of the democratically manifested right to self-determination of nations over the principle of the integrity of existing multinational States  and in this connection it has also brought about new changes in international law and international relations. The position of small or less developed nations and States within the international order is the key to regional and international stability and cooperation and to just international relations. Without the confirmation of their right to State individuality the United Nations would now consist of about 50  and not 179  Member States. Our recent experience has shown that stable peace and a firm international order are not possible in the post-cold-war world without the security and sovereignty of small nations. It is for these reasons that we believe that the international community is entitled to interfere in the internal affairs of countries in cases involving the control of aggression  humanitarian intervention  the protection of the rights of individuals and of national minorities and the preservation of the environment  in accordance with the principles of  and through mechanisms endorsed by  the international community. Accordingly  we would welcome such a new role for the United Nations  as well as for such regional organizations as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  which would guarantee the protection of the security of all Member States in a process ranging from peace mediation to the imposition of peace. Without such a role the United Nations could not handle such crises as the one affecting the former Yugoslavia. The chief responsibility for international security rests with the Security Council  but the regional organizations should assume the main burden of implementing policy  based on United Nations principles. For this reason we support the establishment of permanent regional military forces capable of rapid peace mediation and action to prevent conflict or repel aggression. Furthermore  Croatia firmly supports the Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace"" and the process of establishing permanent United Nations military forces. In the post-cold-war world  when regional conflicts present the major threat to world security  international peace-keeping and peace-making forces are emerging as the watershed between chaos and stability. Croatia is ready to participate in these forces and to help to bring peace to troubled areas around the world. Had such mechanisms existed  the disastrous Yugo-communist and Serbo-Montenegrin aggression against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina might have been averted. This crisis has obviously reaffirmed the equal right of all nations  particularly young or small nations  to security and has enhanced the need to create such mechanisms. In view of what I have said  we would support the development of a regional security system in our area  a system that could also serve as a model for other crisis areas. Because of their geopolitical importance  ethnic mix and painful historical experience  it is precisely the Balkans and south-eastern Europe that would necessarily require the development of such a model of international regional security congruent with the general system of common security in order that the stability of the global order might be achieved. This implies consideration of all steps to bring about confidence-building and mutual guarantees  the establishment and maintenance of the balance of power and the creation of security zones and protected areas  along with the adjustment and supervision of defensive and other armed forces and doctrines. In order to achieve stability in this part of Europe  in which the processes of both stabilization in the Eastern Mediterranean and in south-eastern Europe and the establishment of stable relations among the newly emerged States are still to be completed  Croatia is prepared to take the initiative in convening an international conference of the countries in the area in order to consider the future model of regional security and cooperation based on common interests and principles embodied in the United Nations Charter and CSCE documents. The Republic of Croatia endorses the coordinated process of regional and general disarmament and welcomes the results already achieved in heavy-armament reduction by the big Powers. Croatia is prepared to cooperate with other countries in reallocating military expenditures to the reconstruction of war-ravaged areas and to peacetime development. This concerns in particular the new States which require international cooperation in the implementation of their democratic and market reforms in order to bolster their domestic stability. The role and the responsibility of the international community are to be seen in the light of the fact that these societies are not strong enough to be able rapidly to become part of the integration processes. Because of this the speedy integration of new States into financial and other institutions should be promoted. We endorse automatic international intervention and other punitive measures when the territorial integrity of other countries is seriously threatened. The United Nations should also envisage a way to prevent the use of military force against the peaceful expression of political will in the solution of domestic political issues. The brutal use of military force against one's own people should not in our time be regarded as merely an internal political problem. We endorse the establishment of a permanent international court for the punishment of war crimes and all actions involving the deliberate violation of peace and international conventions and endangering the lives of the civilian population. In support of an open economy and market principles we propose  within the scope of international development strategies  identifying ways and means to favour and facilitate the transfer of technology  knowledge and the necessary resources to less developed countries or countries destroyed by war. To our mind  it is precisely the United Nations and its agencies that ought to play an important role in this process. The United Nations and its agencies ought to take the lead in handling the return of refugees and the reconstruction of their homes  destroyed cultural monuments  industrial plants and infrastructural facilities processes that are of particular importance to our country. The earliest solution of all issues regarding the succession of States in accordance with international law is of the highest importance for Croatia and other States that have emerged in the area of the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union. In supporting the solution of these issues we are prepared  especially for economic reasons  to make an additional effort in order to codify the experience and norms of international law in this sphere. On this occasion I cannot but add a few words of criticism concerning the inadequate action by international factors to solve the crisis in the territory of the former Yugoslavia  more precisely in preventing the brutal aggression waged by Serbia and Montenegro against Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia appreciates the efforts of the international community -from the United Nations  the European Community and the CSCE to all those international factors that have helped us to stop a mindless and most brutal war waged at the expense of the civilian population before the eyes of the civilized world. We express our deepest sympathy for the human losses the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has suffered in the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the performance of its noblest task. What is really happening there is the sustained aggression of Serbia and Montenegro  now acting under the new name of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  against two sovereign and independent States Members of the United Nations - Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unless stopped  this aggression may mushroom into a conflict on a much broader scale which could spread the disaster of war to the entire European continent  maybe even to the rest of the world. Unfortunately  in spite of that situation the global community has not yet identified a sufficiently efficient mechanism to stop aggression or an effective way to stop brutal destruction  such as Europe has hardly ever experienced  associated with the most barbaric form of ""ethnic cleansing"". The implementation of the Vance plan  created with the authority of the United Nations  is also falling behind schedule because of constant Serbian and Montenegrin sabotage. The mission of UNPROFOR must be seriously speeded up and fully implemented within the mandate of the peace-keeping force. Otherwise it will become meaningless and produce the justified indignation and frustration of the Croatian people who continue to suffer the consequences of aggression. Croatian authorities find it increasingly difficult to control the justified discontent of people displaced from their homes in their own homeland  people who have accepted the role and the intentions of the United Nations and the European Community with optimism and the firm conviction that the wrongs they have suffered would be redressed. These people find it difficult to understand why the international community cannot show  in this particular case  the necessary determination that was shown in the instance of an identical aggression against another sovereign and independent State. The United Nations must summon the will and the power to use all the resources at its disposal in order to bring the war in Croatia to a close and to stop the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the opposite case  if the aggressor is permitted to continue to implement his plan of conquest  the reputation of the United Nations will suffer badly. Finally  let me express my conviction that the United Nations will fulfil its historical task. For its part the Republic of Croatia is prepared to contribute its share in every respect as a full member of the global community. With the holding of multi-party parliamentary elections for the second time in the past two years  in spite of the war forced upon the country  Croatia has severed all links with its communist past and strengthened its democratic order and international position. Having committed itself in its Constitution - in political and economic terms and in all spheres of spiritual and material development - to those principles of democracy and pluralism which also underlie the United Nations  Croatia has declared its openness to cooperation with all its neighbours and other countries in Europe and world wide. Croatia wants to be a factor of peace and stability in the international order in its part of the world. "
"70",3061,"HTI",47,1992,"In the name of the people of Haiti  I am happy to greet you  Sir  and offer you our warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am equally pleased to salute your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  and the new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to whom I extend my most sincere congratulations on his assumption of his position of weighty responsibility. How happy I am to greet you and to welcome the sisterly nations that have just arrived in this great family of ours! As always  the Haitian people cannot refrain from sending special greetings to President Carlos Andres Perez and the Venezuelan people. On the threshold of the third millennium  the clear signals of political pollution invite us all to dialogue in order progressively to bring about a civilization founded on peace. The end of the cold war has offered the world new prospects of peace and cooperation. Nevertheless  hotbeds of tension and the outbreak of new regional conflicts have darkened the picture of international relations. Political pollution at a global level has produced armed conflicts  wars  massacres and coups d'etat against democracy. Therefore  in all humility we would like to share with you eight democratic beatitudes for a civilization of peace. The first democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who defend democracy; may peace prevail among them. The condemnation of the coup d'etat of 30 September 1991 is an expression of the desire of the United Nations to defend the democratic principles and rights of the Haitian people  and we would like to thank you warmly for that. The advent of this civilization of peace  on a global level  necessarily involves restoring constitutional order to Haiti  where blood is flowing  corpses are piling up and repression is intensifying. A coup d'etat in itself is a crime against humankind. These 12 months are symbolic of a double crime against humankind. May the door allowing for a return finally be opened so that peace can once more shine among us. Five days before the coup d'etat of 30 September 1991  here  at the United Nations forum  the people of Haiti cried out: ""Democracy or death!"" Today  on behalf of the 3 000 people assassinated by the enemies of democracy  the Haitian people cries out  with the same conviction and from the same rostrum  the same cry: ""Democracy or death!"" Anyone desirous of peace must defend democracy. May peace return to Haiti! And may peace  likewise  be restored to Yugoslavia and Somalia. The Republic of Haiti condemns the acts of terrorism and genocide that have brought about such a paroxysm of horrific deeds. We appeal to the international community to make itself responsible for progressively creating a civilization of peace. Second democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who promote economic growth  because peace and economic poverty are incompatible. Since the Second World War  global production fell for the first time  by 0.5 per cent last year. In developing countries  economic and social conditions have deteriorated dramatically. Hence subhuman poverty  drug abuse and an increase in crime. Twenty per cent of the wealthiest people in the world have 83 per cent of the world's income  while 20 per cent of the poorest people in the world have only 1.4 per cent of world income. Today  1.2 billion poor people live in the developing countries; in the year 2000  they will number 1.3 billion  and in the year 2025  1.5 billion. But the fundamental principle of international public law is the principle of equality. In this context  Aristotle reminds us that politics requires a reciprocal and symmetrical relationship in which citizens are placed on an equal footing with each other and not above or below each other  (spoke in Creole*) (continued in French) Likewise  in his work entitled Political Justice. Hoffe  while occupying the Chair of ethics and political philosophy  has reminded us that ""on the whole  Plato and Aristotle offered us a florilegium of reasons to demonstrate that life in common is profitable to all those participating in it"". Relationships  therefore  are ruled by laws: laws that must be respected  laws that must not be transgressed  laws in a society of law. Justice must be  as it were  the oxygen of the economy. How can we bring about a civilization of peace unless there is human and economic growth at the world level? It is in this world where  unfortunately  every year almost 3 million children die from vaccine-preventable illnesses. One out of three children suffers from serious malnutrition. Why so much suffering? Must suffering and opulence be necessarily at daggers drawn? The South accounts for 77 per cent of the world's population  but has only 15 per cent of the world's earnings. In Latin America  17 per cent of landowners control 90 per cent of the land. How can one speak of peace when equal civil rights become socio-economic inequality? That is a bitter contrast; that is a startling contradiction  owing to violations of human rights. In our country Haiti it is even worse. The exploitive structures that we inherited must be democratically transformed into structures made up of participation and justice participation by everyone; justice for all; and transparency in all matters. Hence  we will no longer be burdened by this colonial heritage that is so clearly reflected by the following statistics: Over 45 per cent of the national revenue is in the hands of 1 per cent of the population; there are 1.8 doctors for each 10 000 inhabitants; there are 1.9 nurses for each 10 000 inhabitants; in our 56 so-called hospitals  there are but 1.5 beds for each 1 000 sick persons; 59 per cent of urban dwellers and 3 per cent of rural dwellers have access to drinking water; 85 per cent of the population is illiterate  yet extremely intelligent. ""Illiterate"" does not mean ""stupid"". Incumbent on us is the great responsibility to promote productive gainful employment. We will manage to do so by applying judicious macroeconomic policies and effective mesoeconomic measures. Therefore  as always  we will have to locate the human individual in the very heart of development  enable the market to function properly  remedy any defects  introduce material infrastructures  support activities of public interest  develop harmonious relations with the private sector and struggle against corrupt structures. The constitutional process will safeguard participation for all and justice for all. Unity in diversity is indeed the very outline of a political topology in which differences of view can be democratically harmonized. The more equality there is in civil rights  the less inequality there will be in the socio-economic field. I repeat: the more equality there is in civil rights  the less inequality there will be in the socio-economic sphere. The Republic of Haiti shares the suffering of those peoples who are impoverished  starving and abandoned. There are many of those dispossessed people who are in vain seeking the return of what is due to them. In addressing our thanks in advance to all those friends of Haiti who wish to send humanitarian aid to Haiti  we would like to ask you to coordinate the channelling of humanitarian aid with the constitutional Government of the Republic of Haiti and those non-governmental organizations that are accompanying the march of the people of Haiti towards democracy. Despite the controversy that has surrounded the idea of an embargo  the people of Haiti would like to repeat 'Yes' to an embargo. Let us have a real  total and complete embargo at last. Secondly  let us put a stop to the flood of new weapons being pumped continually into Haiti. Thirdly  if a total blockade is required to achieve this  the Haitian people will welcome it. For all those efforts that you have already made and for the support that you intend to give us  may I thank you from the bottom of my heart. One year is too long; twelve months is too long  The third democratic beatitude is: Blessed are those who heroically say No to getting off scot-free; No to vengeance; Yes  to justice. No justice  no peace! The refusal to give one's blessing to impunity is part of the lexicon of justice and morality. Article 42.3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Haiti lays down that ""Abuses  acts of violence and crimes perpetrated against civilians by a military official in the exercise of his duties shall come under the authority of the Courts of common law"". In less than one year  3 000 persons have been assassinated; there have been over 40 000 political refugees; hundreds of thousands of citizens have fled throughout the country  more than a hundred journalists have fallen victim to the terror of the military; the press has been muzzled  priests have been arrested  beaten up and imprisoned  the life of Monsignor Willy Romelus has been threatened; priests  nuns and members of grass-roots ecclesiastical communities or Ti Legliz have been continually persecuted. Rural  popular  socio-professional and trade union organizations have been systematically dismantled or targeted. Many parliamentarians have been persecuted. One Deputy was assassinated in cold blood. Blood is flowing; the corpses are being heaped up. Never has Haiti experienced such a ferocious and bloody dictatorship. Rejected by all States of the world  these criminals have nevertheless been recognized  by the Vatican the only State that has elected to give its blessing to crimes that it should have condemned in the name of the God of justice and peace. What a scandal! Because of this impunity  on 2 June 1992 these criminals burned down the Lafanmi Selavi orphanage. On 5 February 1991 these same criminals burned four street-children and destroyed their orphanage. On 11 September 1988  these same criminals burned down St. Jean Bosco's Church  killing some 50 human beings in broad daylight while they were celebrating the Eucharist. They have destroyed human lives. But they will never  never be able to destroy our love. Let the force of love banish the shades of hatred so that the beacon of peace may shine through. In the light of this peace  in which  as Anaxagoras said  ""the visible is a window on the invisible""  one may well wonder: what would the attitude of the Vatican have been if Haiti had been inhabited by white people? Secondly  what would the attitude of Pope John Paul II have been if Haiti had been Polish? Thirdly  next October Pope John Paul II will be a few kilometres away from Haiti. Will he be the Good Samaritan or the High Priest? St. Luke 10:30-37. In the meantime  love and peace to the Pope  because we gain no merit in loving only those who love us - Luke 6:32. The fourth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who reduce arms expenditures and increase expenditures for human development. World military expenditures add up to $2 million per minute. Since 1945 there have been approximately 150 wars  which have caused a total of 20 million deaths. The developing countries' military expenditures have increased over the last three decades from $24 billion to $173 billion. Peace is promoted by reducing the arms purchases and increasing expenditures on human development. Unfortunately  in our country military expenditures have led not to peace but to the massacre of a non-violent population. An army of 7 000 men accounts for 40 per cent of the national budget. Striking contradictions! That is not to mention drugs; some officers are implicated up to their necks in drug trafficking  a source of corruption par excellence. In the face of so much corruption  millions of victims seem to be echoing Cicero when he asked  ""Ouousque tandem abutere. Catilina. patientia nostra?"": ""How long will you continue to abuse our patience  Catilina?"" The people have categorically rejected that army. We have no need of it  they constantly repeat. ""Police  yes  but this army of criminals  no"" they say to anyone who will listen. In keeping with the Constitution  we  the President of the Republic of Haiti  respond to the people in these terms: Yes to the army  but the army as it is  no. The army should be freed from Cedras and his clique  who have been responsible for the death of several thousand people. Once liberated  it will be integrated and brought up to professional standards  and  in accordance with the Constitution  we shall set up a police force separate from the army. So much  then  for preserving peace. A constitutional and democratic State excludes despotism  tyranny  anarchy and absolute power  because absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Republic of Haiti would be very happy to see the United Nations set up commissions made up of defenders of individual rights to inquire into violations of fundamental rights committed since 30 September 1991. Their presence in Haiti is essential to extend our good experience during the elections of 16 December 1990. Let the United Nations and the Organization of American States meet together in Haiti  urgently  so that finally fine-sounding resolutions can yield visible and fruitful action. The fifth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who resist political pollution  for they will make the sun of peace shine. Deliberate injustice creates two parallel paths: submission and resistance. We  the sons and daughters of Dessalines  Toussaint Louverture and Charlemagne Peralte  say no to submission and yes to resistance. Tolerant towards the intolerant  non-violent towards the violent  flexible towards the intransigent  the Haitian people must make their resistance and mobilization for liberation more dynamic in order to pave the way for a democratic society. Yes  sons and daughters of freedom. Sons and daughters of dignity  We reject submission. We choose resistance. The broad highway of resistance will once again lead us to political stability  a prerequisite for economic development. From February 1991 to September 1991 we had seven months of peace; seven months of political stability; seven months of ""lavalasian"" security! Those seven months of security  of course  made it possible for us to obtain $511 million in gifts or loans from 15 international donors. I pay homage to the women of Haiti  who  through their spirit  were able to make more dynamic the teaching of resistance  Through active  non-violent resistance  let us mobilize energetically to defend human rights. Contempt for human life imperils everything our Haiti and all humanity hold dear  Perseverance  said Plutarch  is invincible. Resistance  we say  is organic. The Republic of Haiti offers encouragement to all those men and women on the five continents who are resisting the forces of conflict. We have been following closely the Middle East peace negotiations and hope that they will result in a peace agreement  which all men and women urgently need. Sixth democratic beatitude: Blessed are those who defend the truth  for they are a source of justice and peace. Indeed  truth remains the foundation of justice. Man can use science to kill truth or feed truth  and the same is true of political power. When leaders seek truth through objectivity they contribute to the maintenance of peace. Economic and anti-democratic forces can follow a strategy that is able to manipulate the information sector  thus spreading an oppressive ""truth"". Therefore  ethics must rise up to oppose any manipulation of the truth or any acceptance of a polluted truth. For us Haitians  men and women alike  our existence is linked to the very roots of our being. Those roots bring us the sap of the naked truth  of ethnic identity and of nourishing dignity. The same is true of our ""lavalasian"" policy. We take from it the sap of liberating truth and democratic ethics. From Socrates to Heidegger  from Hegel to Jean-Paul Sartre  over and above philosophical differences  our political ethic makes it essential for us to seek truth from the very source of objectivity  for a peaceful civilization  within the truth. That is why we chose a constitutional democracy and not a schizophrenic democracy with its implications of psychopathic breakdown  structural dislocation  verbal stereotypes  and hypertrophy of the collective super-ego. As always  we need a political psychology that furthers social peace and the realization of national interests. National interests yes! The interests of the country - yes! The interests of the nation - yes! The interests of the nation compel us to transcend personal relationships in order to save the nation. This can be seen today in the determination of over 90 per cent of the Haitians to continue to say ""No!"" to the usurpers after 12 months of resistance. This can be seen in the determination of the Haitian diaspora -or the ""tenth department"" which today  heroically and proudly  has taken to the streets. They are over 100 000 strong at this very moment  for that is how they say ""Yes!"" to democracy. Their will our will is to defend not individual interests but the interests of the nation. It is noble to die for flag and fatherland! Yes  it is noble to die for flag and fatherland! The sun of this peace will shine in many countries. The Republic of Haiti joyfully welcomes the presence of the United Nations in Cambodia  where there is such a thirst for justice and peace after two decades of war and isolation. It will shine one day in the Caribbean and Latin America. During the first 100 years following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in America  we lost more than 90 million human beings. This was the start of the practice of genocide. May the blood of our ancestors fertilize the Caribbean and America. May their spirit fortify us and guide us towards the triumph of the civilization of peace. The seventh beatitude of democracy: Blessed are they who  regardless of class and race  love one another the Lavalas way. When the black man does not live in peace  the white man cannot enjoy his peace. When the white man does not live in peace  the black man cannot enjoy his peace. Let us love one another the Lavalas way. May the peace of the blacks be with the whites! May the peace of the whites be with the blacks! When the poor man does not live in peace  the rich man cannot enjoy his peace. When the rich man does not live in peace  the poor man cannot enjoy his peace. Let us love one another the Lavalas way. May the peace of the rich be with the poor! May the peace of the poor be with the rich! According to Aristotle  politics demands a reciprocal and symmetrical relationship in which citizens are side by side and not one atop the other. To forge unity in diversity  let us love one another the Lavalas way. The aspiration to peace is inherent in human nature. May it fertilize political praxis  guaranteeing the growth of cultures and respect for human rights: the right to live in freedom; the right to work; the right to eat one's fill; the right of one and all to a seat at the table of democracy. Living in profound communion with our sisters and brothers in South Africa  the Republic of Haiti vigorously condemns the system of apartheid. It is indeed a modern vestige of slavery  day after day eroding human dignity. Finally  the eighth beatitude of democracy: Blessed are they who  on the threshold of the third millennium  discover the true face of the Haitian people. Freedom  dignity  and pride: These are the values written in letters of gold on the brow of this heroic people marching with head held high in quest of peace. Five hundred years ago  our ancestors  in search of peace  threw themselves into the sea  abandoning the boats that were carrying them from Africa to the Caribbean. After 500 years  thousands of political refugees in quest of peace have taken to the sea because the Haitian prefers to die on his feet than to live on his knees. May the true face of the Haitian people never again never again be hidden behind the faces of Papa Doc  Cedras  and the tontons macoutes. all rejected viscerally  democratically  and once and for all by a bare-handed people. Freedom! Dignity! Pride! Yes! He or she who knows the Haitian diaspora or the ""tenth department"" can say  like Archimedes: ""Eureka!"" ""I have found it!"" He or she who knows the Haitian people in Haiti can say  again like Archimedes: ""Eureka!"" ""I have found it! I have found Haiti  where the roots of freedom planted by Toussaint Louverture are sometimes fought  sometimes beaten  but never vanquished"". In the name of the people and its sons and its holy spirit Amen. We will continue to march with every Haitian in Haiti so that some day we be able to meet and live in real democracy."
"71",3107,"HUN",47,1992,"Allow me to express to you my sincere congratulations on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. At the same time  let me once again wish much success to the Secretary-General of our Organization. The scale of the changes that have taken place lately on the international scene is amply demonstrated by the sheer number of new delegations that have joined our ranks at the United Nations. In large areas of our globe  which were shown on the map hitherto only by single-coloured expanses representing federations held together by totalitarian power  we see today a colourful collection of independent States that have regained or are about to gain their sovereignty. There are few countries whose external relations have been affected by these changes as directly and as deeply as ours. The number of Hungary's neighbours has grown from five to seven  and five of them will be shown as independent States only on maps that are to be published in the coming months. Two years ago  when I first had the opportunity to address this forum as the representative of a Hungarian government formed following the first free elections in 45 years  I returned home convinced that the fresh breeze of history was having a reinvigorating effect on the activities of the United Nations as well. The downfall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe not only opened a new chapter in the lives of the peoples of the region  but set on a new course the whole system of international relations. The ensuing total collapse of the bipolar world system and the fading away of the paralysing effect of great-Power confrontation raised particularly high expectations. It appeared that the world Organization would be able to respond effectively in all instances to the challenges to international peace and security. These hopes and expectations  and the faith of some in a swift and radical renewal  are contrasted today by many with the present situation in the world and at the United Nations. Certain sectors of the public view the events of the last year as a dissipation of the hopes fostered by the historic turn of events in 1989 and 1990. They cite the tragedies of Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Somalia  Karabakh  Abkhazia and other regions  the grave and massive violations of human rights  and the persistence of serious economic and social tensions in the world  and reproach the world Organization for not managing the crises effectively. However  we have to show that the United Nations has not retreated from the role it played and regarded as a historic milestone when the Coalition forces  on the basis of the Security Council's authorization  acted against the aggressor and liberated Kuwait. An important stage in this field was the summit meeting of the Security Council in January  which renewed the commitment of the Member States to the collective security system of the United Nations. As a result of this meeting  it seems that preventive diplomacy has now entered the minds of political decision makers as a most promising method of crisis management. We set high value on the substantive and action-oriented report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) that the Secretary-General has prepared on the Security Council's initiative. In our view  it makes good use of the possibilities inherent in the Charter and may serve as a good point of departure for the efforts directed at enhancing the effectiveness of the crisis-prevention  peacemaking  peace-building and peace-keeping role of the United Nations. Now that the relationship between the great Powers is determined not by opposition but agreement and a consistent search for consensus  the dust can be blown off those chapters of the Charter that are related to the international collective security system and had almost become a historic relic. We also concur with the Secretary-General's recommendations concerning a stronger role for the International Court of Justice and the regional organizations. In this connection  I wish to announce that the Hungarian Government  empowered by a recent decision of the parliament  will deposit with the Secretary-General the declaration recognizing as compulsory the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. In view of the fact that the emergence of regional hotbeds of tension is often engendered by conflicts within individual States  one can rightly say in connection with the Agenda for Peace that the viability of preventive diplomacy depends to a decisive extent on how we deal with the relationship between the sovereignty of the State concerned and the preventive measures taken by the international community. Even if an internal conflict can be localized and does not transcend the borders of the country  it has a direct effect on the situation and stability of neighbouring States and  thus  on international peace and security: the strands of bilateral and multilateral political and economic cooperation are weakened  instability emerges  an atmosphere of mistrust prevails  there are massive flows of refugees  environmental damage from the conflict spills over  and so on. It must be stated that in our world today  preventive diplomacy can succeed so long as individual States  already at the early stages of the development of a problem  do make use in a responsible manner of the crisis-prevention possibilities provided by the world Organization and do not regard them as an impairment of their sovereignty. On the other hand  if such possibilities remain unexploited and the problems start festering  the Organization must be prepared to act resolutely  effectively and swiftly  making use of all means at its disposal against a State that threatens peace and security.  In the course of the crisis management of recent years the Security Council has set precedents the latest being the condemnation of ""ethnic cleansing"" and of breaches of international humanitarian law in Bosnia and Herzegovina which make it unambiguously clear that respect for human rights  including the rights of minority communities  is an integral aspect of international peace and security and can by no means be regarded as an internal affair. It is therefore of fundamental importance that the Security Council pay close attention to grave human-rights violations in individual States. Action in this field by the international community is a legitimate manifestation of our common concern and responsibility. This constantly expanding dimension of the Security Council's activity is in accord with the Charter and should be incorporated into preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and  in particular  peace-building. With regard to the practical tasks related to these activities at the United Nations  some progress can be made in the short run  beginning with the current session of the General Assembly. For example  we can take steps with regard to the initiative concerning the establishment  within national frameworks  of standby forces for the peacemaking and peace-keeping activities of the United Nations. Those Governments that have already made specific offers to this end have demonstrated an exemplary attitude. Hungary is ready to do likewise. We are in favour of another initiative aimed at the establishment of a temporary reserve fund to meet the initial cost of peace-keeping operations. Hungary also supports the Secretary-General's proposal that  even on the request of only one of the parties to a conflict  international monitors could  be deployed on the territory  including its border areas  of the requesting party. These measures could be similar to those planned for the near future  with the support of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  in connection with the Southern Slav crisis  in the form of monitoring missions to be sent to Hungary and other States. Central and Eastern Europe are the scene of one of the major changes in international relations. Here the scenario of almost euphoric expectations and of ensuing disillusionment is played out in an especially dramatic way. Following the demise of communism  it seemed that the outlines of a new and unifying Europe were appearing on the horizon. The States in the region were faced simultaneously with the tasks of returning to Europe  both symbolically and in reality  and of ending the conflicts that for centuries had plagued relations between their peoples. We had every right to hope that  this time  the past would not be repeated and that  with guidance through jointly proclaimed democratic ideals  the recognition of interdependence would prevail over confrontation. For the peoples of multinational States welded together by coercion and totalitarian methods  the spread of democracy has also become an experience of national emancipation. It is a telling fact that  following more than seven decades of existence  all three federal States bordering my country recently disintegrated with tempestuous speed or are undergoing a process of disintegration. _ In our view  it is wrong to regard such processes as an entirely retrograde phenomenon and contrasting them with modern integrationist tendencies to deplore them. Internal turmoil  efforts at secession and the breakup of existing State frameworks are most likely to occur where integration does not enjoy genuine popular endorsement and where democratic mechanisms for conflict management are lacking. Today the key issue of stability and security in Central and Eastern Europe is recognition and promotion of the endeavours of peoples for self-determination and of the endeavours of national minorities to secure adequate forms of self-government. This can be advanced only through the combined efforts of the parties concerned and the international community  in conformity with the basic norms of international law. For these peoples  endeavours towards self-determination constitute the first  and apparently unavoidable  step on the road back to Europe the road to participation in a new and voluntary integration. On the other hand and it is gratifying to be able to say this more and more people now recognize the compelling need to deal positively with the problem of national minorities  including those people who  only recently  persisted in denying the reality of such questions. However  it is a mistake for anyone to seek to achieve self-determination and self-government by resurrecting the nineteenth century concept of the nation State  and it is a crime to advance that concept by redrawing frontiers by force or ""ethnic cleansing"". We are all well aware that attempts to create so-called ethnically pure States have more than once in history degenerated into massive tragedy  naked aggression and crimes against humanity and against minorities. The enormous changes that are taking place in our region pose yet another pressing problem: how are we to ensure success for this unprecedented and historic transformation  which is occurring in difficult conditions? We have to cope with a hard legacy  bequeathed by the past  a legacy that is a source of complex problems to solve and of lurking dangers to avoid. The transition from dictatorship and so-called planned economies to political pluralism and market economies is an uncharted path  lacking time-tested models or examples. This process involves tension and sharp internal debate  both economic and social  just as it produces unresolved external problems. In this respect  I should like to mention the vitally important legal  ecological and navigational problems that arose along one of our fluvial frontiers as a result of the construction of a hydroelectric dam on the River Danube. Much to our regret  the bilateral talks aimed at finding a solution to the problem have so far been unproductive. We want to do everything possible to ensure that Hungary and the neighbour in question  with welcome international assistance  can find a mutually acceptable solution rather than add another source of conflict to our region  which is already ridden with tension. The transformations sweeping through Central and Eastern Europe present another question: how are the dark shadows accompanying the rebirth of freedom and democracy to be confronted? These transformations must be protected from all extremes: from the demons of totalitarianism  of whatever colour; from the revival of various brown-shirt ideologies; and from attempts to paint over communism with national colours. All these things  with their demagogic appeal and offer of temptingly simplistic solutions  can only undermine and ruin the unsparing and strenuous efforts to establish and strengthen the rule of law. Hungary is convinced that it will prove to be equal to the historic challenge and will bring about the triumph of the universal and lasting values of our civilization. However  the peoples of our region are far from being the only ones affected by this task and interested in mastering it. Therefore  their efforts to ensure that democratic values prevail require and deserve international support. In the immediate neighbourhood of my country in the former Yugoslavia the gravest crimes and violations of human rights continue to occur. The Southern Slav crisis has for more than a year gravely endangered international peace and security through aggressive nationalism  dictatorial government  the forcible acquisition of territory  ""ethnic cleansing""  the intimidation of minorities and the daily suffering of the 2 million people who have been chased from their homes. Grave responsibility for the outbreak of the crisis and the spread of the conflict to successive new areas rests with Serbian nationalism and its regular and irregular armed forces. The value judgement of the international community in that respect was expressed again as recently as last week in the relevant General Assembly resolution. We believe that the Security Council too must take further concrete measures to promote a comprehensive  lasting and equitable settlement of the crisis. It is indispensable to expand the international presence in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to increase its effectiveness. The peace-keeping forces of the United Nations  which have earned all our recognition  should have their mandate extended  with their preventive deployment in areas where such action is warranted and has not been taken so far. The brutality raging almost undisturbed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia is a telling signal that the world has not yet done everything possible to enforce  with all the means at its disposal  the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter. The aggressor must be made aware that the international community  including the States of Europe  will under no circumstances acquiesce in situations brought about as a result of violent conquests and inhumane actions  and is prepared to cast out from among its ranks all those who would want to pull our continent back to the age of barbarism. On the threshold of a new world full of great opportunities  the United Nations must take a firm stand against aggressions and breaches of law. It is no exaggeration to say that the peace and tranquillity of present and future generations will depend on that choice. It is with deep concern that our public opinion is following the developments of the situation of the Hungarian minority in Serbian Vojvodina and other areas under Serbian control  where a Hungarian community close to half a million lives in increasing danger and under threat. Serbian policy not only has chased tens of thousands of Hungarians from their ancestral homes  but is now intent on settling several thousand Serbian refugees in territories of Vojvodina and Croatia inhabited by Hungarians and others  thereby forcibly changing the ethnic composition of whole areas. This is a grave violation of resolutions of the Security Council and of the decisions of the London Conference  which demands an adequate response. Recently  Hungary has given shelter to over 80 000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia  in addition to the more than 50 000 who had arrived earlier from another neighbouring country. I know from personal experience that these refugees are eager to return  but the conditions that would enable them to do so are  unfortunately  not yet ripe. In order to create such conditions as soon as possible  we consider it necessary for the United Nations forces in the former Yugoslavia to assume an active role in conformity with the Vance plan to assist the safe return of the refugees  to create conditions under which the right of the returnees can be guaranteed and the prosecution of those responsible for violations of law can take place. The Hungarian side offers its full cooperation to this end. We cannot speak of freedom  democracy  justice and  consequently  of the rule of law when the rights of national  ethnic  linguistic or religious minorities are not respected. The legitimate aspirations of the minorities to preserve their identity  language  culture and religion  as well as to foster relations with their mother nations  do not at all call into question their loyalty as citizens. These aspirations  therefore  cannot be regarded as a threat to the unity of the State. The various concepts of autonomy arising out of a particular minority situation do not call into question the framework of the State concerned. Their purpose is to create the proper conditions for the self-government of minorities and for the exercise of their rights in a way that fits into the constitutional and legal order. Life demonstrates that orderly minorities do not weaken  on the contrary  they unequivocally strengthen the stability of the State and its internal social peace. In this connection  we sincerely welcome the settlement by Austria and Italy of the issue of Alto Adige-Sud Tirol. This example may be worth following as a democratic solution for minority problems and may serve as a credible counterargument in the face of those forces that do not tire of suggesting  by way of whispered propaganda or spectacular and noisy demonstrations  that the raising of such questions is meant only to conceal territorial demands. The United Nations  as the most comprehensive multilateral organization  has a major role to play in the promotion of the rights of minorities. We attach particularly great significance to the completion of the draft Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National  Ethnic  Religious and Linguistic Minorities. We see this as an important initial stage of a process. However  the effective protection of minorities also requires the drawing up of binding international norms. Consequently  we consider it desirable to start the relevant codification process as soon as possible. In the field of minority protection  it is essential to introduce an institutional system of international guarantees and to create suitable fact-finding  monitoring  conciliation and counselling mechanisms  such as a complaints mechanism with the competent international forums. These forums would be empowered to investigate infringements of minority rights  identify   those responsible  eliminate the consequences of the infringement of rights and compensate the injured party. In this context  mention must be made of the important step forward taken by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe with the establishment of the Office of High Commissioner on National Minorities. We must all trust that the conflicts inevitably arising out of the radical transformations in our world will be solved through dialogue  compromise and  when necessary  recourse to international forums. Even crises and difficulties cannot eclipse the fact that since the end of the cold war the international community has become capable of taking incomparably more efficient measures than previously to deal with threats to international peace and security. Hungary is convinced that our rejuvenating world Organization will overcome the ""too-little-too-late"" syndrome  will also have the necessary financial resources and as a result of the reforms already under way will be in a better position to meet the requirements of our times. In this field  as in so many others  we must be ready to leave behind an old era that should never return. "
"72",3154,"IDN",47,1992,"It gives me great pleasure to extend to you. Sir  my sincere congratulations on your unanimous election as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To your distinguished predecessor. Ambassador Shamir S. Shihabi  I should like to convey our deep appreciation for the exemplary manner in which he presided over the last session. I am also pleased to see our eminent Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  by your side. His incisive analysis of the impediments to the realization of the full potential' of the United Nations and his recommendations on how to strengthen its capacity to maintain peace  secure independence and justice and foster generalized prosperity in the world  as contained in his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  do indeed deserve our serious consideration. We welcome the new Members in our midst: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Their accession to membership not only brings us ever closer to the goal of true universality of our Organization but also underscores the unflagging hope that humanity reposes in this multilateral forum for resolving the global issues of our time. It is my privilege and responsibility to bring to the Assembly a message from the developing countries belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement. I come here from the Tenth Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  which Indonesia had the distinct honour to host earlier this month. It was the largest Non-Aligned Summit ever convened. I am honoured  therefore  to address the Assembly not only on behalf of the 180 million people of Indonesia  but also on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement  which has 108 members  representing the vast majority of humankind and close to two thirds of the members of the Assembly. On behalf of the leaders of the Movement  whose consensus views were summed up in what has come to be known as the Jakarta message  may I convey to the Assembly the gist of that message. As a political coalition encompassing more sovereign States than has any other grouping in history  we shall not be mere spectators nor agree to be on the sidelines of the currents of historical change now sweeping across the globe. We commit ourselves to the shaping of a new international order free from war and poverty  intolerance and injustice  a world order based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and genuine interdependence  one that takes into account the diversity of the social systems and cultures of the world. We pledge to seek that new international order through the central and irreplaceable instrumentality of the United Nations. Holding fast to the principles of the Movement as first articulated at Bandung 37 years ago  we affirm the fundamental rights of every human being and every nation to development  to social progress and to full participation in the shaping of their common destiny. Through dialogue and cooperation our Movement will seek to place itself as a vibrant  constructive and interdependent component of the mainstream of international relations so that a new international order can take shape on a truly universal basis  ensuring harmony  peace  justice and prosperity for all. That is the essence of the Jakarta message. Permit me now to elaborate on a few points. The comprehensive decisions and positions adopted by the tenth non-aligned summit  as recorded in its final documents  constitute both a response and an initiative  a dynamic adaptation in the face of the challenges and opportunities posed by the profound and radical developments that have transformed the patterns of international relationships. To a large extent the Non-Aligned Movement contributed to these global transformations. The unrelenting drive that it imparted to the world-wide decolonization process and to the struggle against racism hastened the demise of colonial empires  the rise of numerous newly independent States and the retreat of the inhuman policy of apartheid. And yet the world today is still far from being peaceful  just and secure. Simmering disputes  violent conflicts  aggression and foreign occupation  interference in the internal affairs of States  policies of hegemony and domination  ethnic strife  religious intolerance  new forms of racism and narrowly conceived nationalism continue to obstruct the building of harmonious coexistence between States and peoples and have even led to the disintegration of States and societies. A profoundly anguishing example is that of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  whose break-up has led to the formation of separate  independent States  three of which  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia and Slovenia  have since become Members of the United Nations. On these explosive and tragic crises in various parts of the world our Movement has taken a clear stand. We have called for speedy and resolute action to end the carnage in Bosnia and Herzegovina and condemned the massive atrocities and violations of human rights being committed against the people of that Republic  especially its Muslim population. We have also condemned the repugnant policy of ""ethnic cleansing""  reaffirmed the inadmissibility of aggression and of acquisition of territory by force  and called for full respect for the sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity and cultural identity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have launched collective action to help alleviate the immense suffering of the people of Somalia and to play a critical role in the search for a comprehensive solution to the fratricidal conflict in that land. We have reiterated our unflinching support for the struggle of the Palestinian people  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  to realize their inalienable right to self-determination  independence and sovereign statehood in their own homeland. We call on the world community to prevail upon Israel to contribute to the search for peace through the implementation of the Security Council resolutions that provide for the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestine and Arab lands. And once again we stress the imperative need to end the universally condemned system of apartheid  once and for all  and of establishing a non-racial  democratic and united South Africa. Having welcomed the end of the Gulf War and the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity  we have urged the commencement of a process of reconciliation that will finally heal the wounds of war and restore stable peace and harmonious cooperation in that region. While we rejoiced at the establishment of the transitional government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan  the tenth summit noted with regret that the process towards national reconciliation and the establishment of a permanent government through free and fair elections is still marred by continuing internecine strife. We hope that these obstacles will soon be overcome so that peace can be restored and national reconstruction can commence. On Cambodia  we have reiterated our confidence in the determination and capability of the Cambodian people  under the leadership of Prince Samdech Norodom Sihanouk and the members of the Supreme National Council  with the assistance of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)  to uphold the Paris Agreements in their balanced totality. We remain convinced that the Paris Agreements are still the best basis for the achievement of a comprehensive  just and durable peace in Cambodia  based on national reconciliation and reconstruction. Only through their strict implementation will it be possible to bring to an end the protracted war that has inflicted unspeakable suffering and devastation on the Cambodian people. A world caught in the throes of pervasive change and transition is basically an unstable and unpredictable world. The Movement has therefore resolved to intensify its efforts in the field of disarmament. While it is true that there has been encouraging progress in limiting nuclear and conventional armaments  the disarmament agenda is still largely unfinished. A nuclear-weapon-free world has always been the vision of our movement  for until it is achieved this threat to human survival will continue to cast its shadow over all other endeavours and aspirations. We have urged accelerated efforts on other priority disarmament issues  particularly the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction. Besides posing an acute danger to world peace and security  the continuing global arms race and unbridled military spending also constitute a huge drain on national economies and on the world economy. Our Movement has consistently maintained that the resources released through disarmament and arms reduction should be redirected towards the social and economic development of all countries  especially the developing countries. The establishment of this productive linkage between disarmament and development will also make it possible to attain security at lower levels of armament. We should now recognize that peace and security depend as much on socio-economic factors as on military ones. Sharply reduced prospects for economic and social advancement  large-scale unemployment  abject poverty  massive cross-border migrations and severe environmental degradation also endanger peace. We cannot hope to attain comprehensive security and stable peace without making substantive progress in the war against poverty  underdevelopment  disease and social injustice. That is why it should deeply concern us that the world economy is mired in sluggish and uneven growth. With few exceptions  developing countries are experiencing stagnation or vastly inadequate growth rates  with the most vulnerable ones slumping into sharp decline. Most alarming is the prolonged critical situation in Africa where the plight of millions requires speedy and decisive action. Africa deserves our special attention. Developing countries in general are severely hampered by an unfavourable external economic environment characterized by inadequate access to technology  unabated protectionism  historically low prices for commodities and raw materials  severely contracted financial flows and the crushing burden of external debt  resulting in reverse financial flows to the developed countries and the multilateral financial institutions. The external debt crisis of the developing countries has intensified in magnitude and global impact  and is being exacerbated by volatile exchange-rate fluctuations for the major currencies and by high interest rates. The debt-reduction schemes that have been tried are far from adequate; they need to be broadened to include all kinds of debts and all categories of debtors  including those that have made great efforts to meet their debt obligations. A differentiated approach should be adopted that would allow debt cancellation for the least developed countries and more generous terms  in both debt servicing and new concessional loans  for lower-income developing countries. Our Movement will continue to press for a coordinated and development-oriented approach to the solution of this problem that will bring relief as well as allow for the recovery and continued growth of debtor countries. Even global developments that appear to imply positive prospects could have a negative impact on the developing countries. The transformation of Central and Eastern European economies and the formation of powerful groupings among developed countries could deflect the focus from poverty alleviation in developing countries and adversely affect their trade and growth prospects. Particularly lamentable is the continuing impasse in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Non-Aligned Movement has therefore called on the developed countries to ensure without further delay a balanced  equitable and satisfactory conclusion of the Uruguay Round that would take into account the interests of all parties  especially the development needs and concerns of the developing countries. We  the non-aligned countries  realize too well that global problems are interlinked  especially in the economic sphere. And because most of today's problems are global in nature  they cannot be solved through short-term relief measures or through piecemeal reform. Hence  it is time the countries of both the North and the South forged a new compact on development and a new democratic partnership in fashioning global solutions to these global problems. Only in that way can we deliver the world economy from its present disarray and do away with the inequitable international structures and modalities that have resulted in deepening disparities and unacceptable injustices in international economic relations and an inexorably widening prosperity and technology gap between the developed and the developing countries. Only in .that way can we hope to restructure the international economic system and international economic relations so as to make them more equitable and thus more viable. We  the non-aligned countries  have therefore called for a revival of the constructive dialogue between the North and the South. But this time the dialogue should be based on the imperative of genuine interdependence  mutuality of interests and of benefits  and shared responsibility  with the positions of each side clearly elaborated and presented  and rationally discussed and negotiated. Never before have the fate and fortunes of the North and the South been so inextricably intertwined. In the absence of stability and development in the South  the North cannot hope to sustain its economic prosperity. Without a favourable global environment  which the policies of the North should provide  the South cannot achieve its development goals. Thus  common sense dictates the need for both sides to sit down and discuss how together they can manage the massive changes and challenges of the decades ahead. At the same time  we have resolved to intensify South-South cooperation on the basis of collective self-reliance. This is imperative  for South-South cooperation is vital for promoting our own development and for reducing undue dependence on the North. It is also an integral element in any strategy for the attainment of a new and equitable international economic order. Towards that end  we are initiating concrete cooperative ventures in such areas as food security  population  trade and investment  and devising practicable modalities for their implementation. By thus pooling the resources  expertise and experience of the South  we hope to translate the concept of collective self-reliance into reality. We invite the developed countries and the multilateral financial institutions to support us in this endeavour  for it should be clear that the fostering of expanded economic cooperation among the developing countries will in turn impart added vitality to the growth and expansion of the world economy as a whole and yield corresponding benefits to the developed countries as well. A global concern that requires the heightened attention of the entire international community is the rapid degradation of the environment. We  the non-aligned countries  welcome the results of the Conference held in Rio de Janeiro. They confirm the long-held conviction of our Movement that the issues of environment and development are inseparable and should be integrally addressed on the basis of equitably shared responsibility. The pursuit of environmentally sound and sustainable development will require a global partnership that will have to address the need of developing countries for commensurate  additional financial resources and access to environmentally sound technology. Even more important is the effective implementation of the agreed policies  which will require constant monitoring and consistent follow-through. In this context  we welcome the establishment of the high-level Commission on Sustainable Development. We also believe that social development is no less vital than political and economic development. We therefore support the convening of a world summit on social development which should place the social needs of people at the heart of United Nations endeavours. The full and equal integration of women into the development process has always been a goal of the Non-Aligned Movement. Consequently  we shall fully cooperate in ensuring the success of the World Conference on Women in 1995. We believe that all children should be raised with a standard of living that is adequate for their health and well-being. We shall work to achieve that goal as a matter of moral imperative and commit ourselves to the full and effective implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Summit for Children. At Jakarta  the non-aligned countries enunciated an unequivocal stand on human rights. Allow me to quote from the Jakarta Message: ""We reaffirm that basic human rights and fundamental freedoms are of universal validity. We welcome the growing trend towards democracy and commit ourselves to cooperate in the protection of human rights. We believe that economic and social progress facilitates the achievement of these objectives. No country  however  should use its power to dictate its concept of democracy and of human rights or to impose conditions on others. In the promotion and protection of these rights  we emphasise the inter-relatedness of the various categories  call for a balanced relationship between individual and community rights  and uphold the competence and responsibility of national governments in their implementation. The Non-Aligned Countries  therefore  shall coordinate their positions and actively participate in the preparatory work for the Second World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 in order to ensure that the Conference addresses all aspects of human rights on the basis of universality  indivisibility  impartiality and non-selectivity."" Moreover  it is our firm conviction that the objective of human rights is the realization of the full potential of the human being  and human potential is not confined to the political field. The fundamental right to economic and social development  for example  cannot be separated and cannot be treated separately from the other categories of human rights. These rights apply to nations as well as to individuals. Thus  every nation has the right to determine its own political and economic system and to preserve its cultural identity as shaped by its own particular historical experience. The advanced countries of the West have recently been vocal in calling for democracy and good governance as an integral part of the development process  especially in the developing countries. Some are even inclined to make it a new conditionality in development cooperation. The call for democratization and democratic reform in all countries is indeed valid  for it relates directly to the basic aspirations of individuals and nations. But democracy is not a static concept limited to certain established forms and practices. Its basic principles and tenets are indeed of universal and immutable validity. But no single model of democracy can be assumed to be of universal applicability  given the diversity of cultural values and historical experiences of the nations of the world. Moreover  it would be a denial of the basic tenets of democracy if its values were to be strictly observed within nations while they are being ignored among nations. Hence democracy and democratization are dynamic processes that should conform to the fundamental values of each nation and constantly adapt to evolving realities in order to remain relevant and  more important  democratic. These observations equally apply to the United Nations. That is why the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has always insisted that this multilateral Organization should likewise reflect the democratic spirit of equality  equity and transparency  in representation as well as in the processes of decision-making. Therefore the United Nations and its principal organs should periodically undergo a process of review and revitalization in order to ensure its dynamic adaptation to the evolving realities of international life  and in order that it may continue to play an effective role as the focal point for the management of the critical global issues of our time. We the non-aligned countries have therefore resolved to play an active and constructive role in the revitalization  restructuring and democratization of the United Nations system. For this purpose  we have decided to establish a high-level working group charged with elaborating concrete proposals for the restructuring of the United Nations. We believe that a balanced relationship among the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council and the Secretary-General is imperative. There should be greater accountability of the Security Council to the General Assembly on decisions and actions affecting the interests of the entire international community. The role of the General Assembly as a forum for deliberation  negotiation and decision-making must be enhanced. It is our conviction that the United Nations capacity for enhancing international development and cooperation should be strengthened by revitalizing the Economic and Social Council. We believe that the office of the Secretary-General should be provided with resources that are commensurate with its tasks  which have vastly expanded as a result of recent world events. The Secretary-General's mandate should be enlarged to enable him to take the necessary initiatives in the pursuit of preventive diplomacy and in enhancing the efficacy of United Nations peace-making  peace-keeping and peace-building operations. We believe also that it is time to address the matter of the size and composition of the Security Council. This  we realize  should be done with circumspection  for it involves a fundamental aspect of the Organization's purposes and functions. When the Charter of the United Nations was framed and its organs established in 1945  the main preoccupation of its founding members was rightly so that never again should the scourge of war be allowed to devastate humankind. They therefore envisioned a collective security system that they thought could be capable of preventing another world war. Since then  however  the world has changed in a most profound way. Over the past 47 years  numerous nations achieved their independence and joined the United Nations as sovereign Member States  thus giving the Organization near-universality in its composition. Their entry reflected the universal drive of peoples to liberate themselves from colonial bondage. But what was the ultimate goal of the struggle? They fought for political independence  not because it was an end unto itself  but because it was the necessary condition for the attainment of a further and larger goal: development. Those who fought for independence invariably had a vision of their own people attaining the blessings and the dignity of economic and social progress  which is never possible in a state of political subjugation. In a very real sense  true freedom is attained only through development  and the formal trappings of political independence are empty until they are substantiated by economic and social progress. While it may be true that colonialism in its classical form has virtually come to an end  the process of decolonization will not be finished until economic independence is achieved. Thus  if in the past the major preoccupation of the United Nations was  rightly  the prevention of another world conflagration and the liberation of peoples from political bondage  today the world  and therefore the United Nations  should be seized with the struggle of all countries for national development. This preoccupation should be reflected in the work of the United Nations and in the composition and dynamics of its organs  in particular the Security Council. We live in an age of development in which economic power has become more decisive than ever. We live in a world where billions of people in the developing countries of the South are beginning to assert their right to realize their economic and social potential. We believe therefore that the Security Council should be expanded to accommodate new members who  if they are not to be given veto powers  should at least serve as permanent members. They should join the Council on the basis of a combination of relevant criteria that more faithfully reflect the world situation today. That means that the criteria should also take into account the changing concept of security  which has now to emphasize the economic and social aspects as much as the military. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the economic policies of industrialized countries and the economic weight of the developing countries  particularly the most populous among them  have as much bearing on international peace and security as the armaments of the military Powers. We further believe that it may also be timely and pertinent that the manner in which the veto powers are now exercised should be subjected to a constructive review. The full elaboration of the meaning and intent of the Jakarta message will be found  not in our speeches  but in the concrete work of the Movement in the days to come. It is a momentous task that we have to undertake the building of a new world order dedicated to peace as well as to justice  to security as well as to development  to democracy both within and among States  and to the promotion of the fundamental rights of nations as well as of individual human beings. Let me re-emphasize that to the non-aligned countries  any new world order is viable and commonly acceptable only if based on recognition of the United Nations as its center-piece and its universal framework and if rooted in the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. This endeavour will take more than the exercise the best efforts of any single country or any group of countries. But with the help of God Almighty  with the support and participation of all nations that share our aspirations  we shall  God willing  achieve that new world order. "
"73",3201,"IND",47,1992,"May I  at the outset  congratulate you. Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I should also like to express our appreciation for the stewardship of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly by your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia. This is the first session of the General Assembly since Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali assumed the office of Secretary-General of the United Nations  and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to his dynamism  diplomatic skills and zeal for reform. I should also like to welcome into our midst the new Members of the United Nations and wish them success in their multifarious efforts and tasks. There have been dramatic changes world wide since the Assembly last met  in 1991. Some of these changes augur well  while others present uncertain prospects. While the cold war and the East-West confrontation are now  happily  but aberrations of the past  the shadow of conflict and suffering looms large in Yugoslavia  in Somalia and  indeed  in many other parts of the world. We cannot  therefore  be complacent or euphoric. What should have made the world safer has at the same time unleashed tendencies ethnic  sectarian and other - that threaten to keep it unsafe. The efforts of developing countries to improve their socio-economic conditions remain hamstrung by the inequities of the present international economic order. Therefore  what we need to work for is a new international order free from war  poverty  illiteracy and injustice. In this great endeavour the United Nations has a central role to play. Some eight and a half months ago  in this very city of New York  at the summit of the Security Council  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao pointed out that ""Lasting peace and security necessarily require comparable levels of human happiness across the globe. It is impossible to think of a United Nations functioning usefully or harmoniously while humankind continues to be riddled with ever-increasing disparities"". (S/PV.3046. p. 96) That is the concern that animates and reinforces our commitment to a United Nations dedicated as much to peace and stability as to progress and prosperity. The international community's efforts in this direction are none the less haunted by the shadow of continuing violence and conflict around the world. India has been deeply concerned at the conflict in Yugoslavia. The tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina demands redress. Its people must be given the chance to lead their lives in peace. India believes that the good work the United Nations is doing in that region deserves all our support. We also trust that decisions taken here will not complicate either the search for peace or the functioning of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in a difficult and dangerous situation. Somalia's tragedy is equally heart-rending. The wretchedness of its people  caught in a seemingly endless cycle of violence and misery  cries out for redress. The United Nations has instituted a valiant and generous operation there to provide relief to those affected. India believes that all the Somalian parties should work together to bring the conflict to an end so that tranquillity can be restored and the people of Somalia can be given the chance to work out their own destinies in peace. After years of suffering  the people of Cambodia aspire to build a sovereign  independent  non-aligned nation for themselves. The United Nations cannot falter in Cambodia  and the parties concerned in that country have a responsibility to ensure the success of the United Nations efforts. India has consistently supported the sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-aligned status of Afghanistan. We hope that all the parties there will work to restore peace and harmony so that the people of Afghanistan can have the opportunity  free of violence and conflict  to work for their own well-being. A glimmer of hope is visible on the West Asian horizon  with Israel and its Arab neighbours settling down to a dialogue. The numerous resolutions adopted by the Security Council and the General Assembly provide the necessary goals for those negotiations. The occupation of Arab lands should be vacated and the restitution of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  including their right to establish an independent State  as well as the security of all States in the region  should be assured if a genuine settlement with lasting peace is to be achieved in that part of the world. What the United Nations was able to do in restoring to Kuwait its independence and sovereignty was a singular achievement. India has traditionally enjoyed the warmest of relations with Kuwait  and we trust that following the restoration of its sovereignty Kuwait will also be able to recover the prosperity that it formerly enjoyed. I should like to add here that India feels sympathy for the civilian population of Iraq  and we believe that its needs should be looked at with generosity. Iraq's sovereignty as a State and its territorial integrity should be respected. The recent unfortunate violence in South Africa and the setback to the negotiations there for the elimination of apartheid will  we hope  be temporary. It is encouraging that the parties concerned have welcomed the catalytic role of the United Nations  which is fully committed to the objective of establishing a democratic  non-racial and united South Africa. As the country that first brought the question of apartheid to the United Nations in 1946  India is hopeful that the presence of United Nations observers will help to end the violence there and to get the negotiating process going once again. India has noted the recent changes in Fiji. I hope that the Government of Fiji will eschew racial and ethnic discrimination and revert to democratic governance at an early date. The Secretary-General has been able to record some progress on the issue of Cyprus. The acceptance by the parties concerned of the Secretary-General's ""set of ideas"" is significant. We share the Secretary-General's hope that the next round of direct talks in October will be the conclusive one. At this session the Assembly will take up the matter of the recently negotiated chemical-weapons Convention. The Convention opens up possibilities for similar action in other areas of disarmament. In this context  India in 1988 proposed an action plan for nuclear disarmament within a specified time-frame. As an immediate step  the United Nations should envisage the following: a convention on the non-use of nuclear weapons  a verifiable freeze on the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes  a suspension of nuclear-weapon tests and negotiations on general and complete disarmament. Non-proliferation is a laudable objective  and India's commitment to it has been affirmed time and again. But there should be no distinction between nuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States when it comes to rights and obligations. The geographical spread of nuclear arsenals has  as it were  nuclearized the globe. Therefore  the international community's efforts should be directed against that global menace. As part of them  regional non-proliferation should be considered only within the context of a properly specified region  taking into account the security concerns of the countries of the region  whose prior agreement should be obtained. Human rights have gained emphasis in recent times  and deservedly so. India welcomes the changes around the world that have strengthened human rights and fundamental freedoms. In line with our democratic traditions  independent judiciary and press and alert public  India has decided to set up a national human-rights commission further to safeguard and promote fundamental human rights in India. I should like to point out here that one of the most vicious forms of human-rights violations today is the violence unleashed by terrorists. And terrorism assumes a particularly pernicious character when it is aided  abetted and sponsored from abroad. Such sponsorship is against the principles of the United Nations Charter  and should be vigorously opposed by all. The United Nations recognizes its responsibilities for providing humanitarian assistance to Member States facing grave humanitarian crises. The newly created capacity of the United Nations to deal with such situations has performed creditably. It is important in this context that we mobilize the United Nations to address the root causes of many such disruptions: poverty  illiteracy and lack of development. It is equally important for the United Nations to be seen to be acting correctly and impartially in this field and at the request of the country concerned. The report of the Secretary-General entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) articulates the wealth of experience that the United Nations has gained in recent years in peacemaking and peace-keeping  and is an important and welcome input into our study of how the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security can be strengthened. India  given its traditional and long-standing contribution to United Nations peace-keeping forces  takes a special interest in the matter. I trust that we shall be able to respond positively and constructively  in keeping with the United Nations Charter  to the Secretary-General's ideas. It should be ensured that the measures envisaged do not lead to the abridgement of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. They should also respect the cardinal tenet of non-interference in the internal affairs of States. Just as international activism should not violate accepted norms of international relations  the principle of self-determination has to be seen in the context of respect for national sovereignty. Self-determination can apply only to peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation  and not to integral parts of sovereign nations. The implementation of the proposals made by the Secretary-General will mean a more vigorous Security Council. An enhanced mandate for the Council requires matching transparency and democracy in its functioning. This cannot be done without an expansion of the membership of the Council to reflect the increased membership of the United Nations over the past few years  as well as the realities of the many changes in the international situation. And here I would submit that along with economic criteria  other relevant criteria should be given due weight in this context. The expansion in membership that I referred to is all the more essential if the Council is to ensure its moral sanction and political effectiveness. As the Secretary-General points out in his report on the work of the Organization ""Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its principles within the world Organization itself."" (A/47/1  para. 169) Similarly  the General Assembly has to be made more effective so as to represent not only the changes in its membership  but also the significant character of its universal composition. An agenda for development is as important to the United Nations as an agenda for peace. Any effort to assign to the United Nations only a complementary role in the economic and social field is  in fact  contrary to the letter and spirit of the Charter. The United Nations should continue to have a central role in macroeconomic policy formulation and implementation  because this is the only forum for reaching an international consensus on development. Developing nations around the globe  including India  are engaged in major reforms of their internal economic policies and mechanisms with a view to integrating their economies with the global economy. These reforms will have very limited meaning unless the external economic environment becomes conducive to the growth and development of developing countries. The Secretary-General  in his report on the work of the Organization  makes it clear that ""the Organization's responsibilities and commitments in the political and security area should not be carried out at the expense of its responsibilities in the development field ..."" (A/47/1  para. 66) This underpins and reinforces the continuing commitment of the United Nations in the field of development  particularly of the developing countries. The world economy is integrating both globally and regionally. But in the process  the needs of the developing countries are not finding the attention and response that they deserve. Hence  it becomes imperative that certain international events succeed such as the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations  whose early  successful and balanced outcome would inject growth impulses into the world economy as a whole. The North-South dialogue is languishing and deserves reactivation. There are various other inequities in global economic interaction - such as poor commodity prices  monetary imbalances and others that call for urgent redress. The developing countries look to the United Nations for correctives in these fields. Socio-economic progress in developing countries will  in turn - I have no doubt about it enrich the prosperity of the developed world itself. Here  may I mention a disquieting aspect in this field  namely the tendency to impose non-economic conditionalities in international development assistance. They should be avoided so that the effectiveness of development assistance may not be impaired. My delegation sees merit in a number of proposals in the area of the developmental activities of the United Nations put forward by various groups  particularly the Nordic countries. In our view  one of the principal objectives of the exercise should be to decentralize the operational activities of the United Nations system so that countries and regions with their special characteristics and levels of development may be able to implement programmes suitable to them. Also  adequate resources should be found to promote development in the developing countries. The process of the restructuring of the United Nations should take into account the additional responsibilities assigned to the United Nations by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) that was held this year. The concept of sustainable development has to be translated into workable strategies and policy measures. In the pursuit of sustainable development  developing countries need resources and  what is more  technical assistance  as well as environmentally sound technologies on preferential and concessional terms. I do hope that the establishment of a Commission on Sustainable Development in the course of the present session will lead to effective follow-up of UNCED. The creation of a Planet Protection Fund  which places on all countries  except the least developed  an obligation to acquire and develop environment-friendly technologies  will facilitate universal participation in the collective effort to attain sustainable development. The non-aligned countries  meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government in Jakarta earlier this month  issued the Jakarta message  which states: ""A shift in focus of international relations to strengthen multilateral cooperation based on genuine interdependence  mutuality of interests and shared responsibility  has become indispensable."" If we  in the international community and here at the United Nations  are to cooperate to combat global menaces and inequalities  we will need to forge a global partnership. And here  I am reminded of what the Prime Minister of India stated at the recent summit of non-aligned countries to which I have referred: ""We are happy to note that the United Nations  at last  is coming into its own in the fifth decade of its existence. While even today there is a tendency to subordinate the global agenda to narrow national concerns  we are happy to note that the United Nations is more effective than ever before. The question now is to make it even more effective."" Let us also hope that the Assembly as its present session will promote the effectiveness of the United Nations even further by shaping it as an instrument of international consensus and action and of common benefit in all matters of international concern. "
"74",3247,"IRL",47,1992,"I extend my warm congratulations to you  Sir  and to Bulgaria on your election to the office of President of the General Assembly. Ireland  as one of the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly  looks forward to cooperating closely with you as you guide our work at this session of the Assembly. In the weeks ahead the Assembly will examine many aspects of current international life. But today I want to focus on two issues that I believe  my country believes  my Government believes  require our urgent attention. First  we must act now to save the millions starving in Somalia; and secondly  the United Nations must move the questions of justice and development to the top of its agenda. We have had too many Somalias. Our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  is the first African to lead the Organization  and I wish to begin my short address with that particular continent. Last month I spent three or four days in Somalia  and I will shortly return there with the President of Ireland  Mary Robinson. She has decided to visit Somalia to show solidarity with the people of that starving land  and to underline the compelling need for more effective international action. My visit was a profoundly disturbing experience. Words fail before the scale of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering. Yesterday at one feeding station alone in Baidoa  which I visited during my visit  532 people died in one day. Today  many more will die. And tomorrow. Until we act. It is a scandal. It is a scandal for Somalia's leaders who continue to squabble and fight while their people continue to starve and die. It is a scandal for outsiders  for the developed world  for the membership of the United Nations  who have failed to respond swiftly and effectively.* Throughout  international non-governmental organizations and organizations from my own country have taken the lead  and I believe it is now time for Governments and the international community to follow. I pay a tribute to their humanitarian work and their determined efforts to confront us with this appalling crisis. Their generosity and courage should inspire a more comprehensive and committed response from the international community. What must be done? First  we must increase the volume of food and relief supplies reaching Somalia. Unless 60 000 tons of food can be distributed each month  children  women and old people will continue to die. There will be more Baidoas. Secondly  food and medicine must be distributed in conditions of civil order. Ambassador Sahnoun  the exceptional and very worthy Special Representative of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  is vigorously promoting improved security. He deserves our full support. The deployment of United Nations troops will provide an essential measure of protection for food distribution. We must all  particularly the regional organizations and Somalia's neighbours  impress on clan and faction leaders the need to cooperate fully with the aid effort. Thirdly  we must work for a process of national reconciliation and for the formation of a Government with national authority. A political solution is essential for long-term recovery and to prevent a relapse into the horror that we now witness daily. The international community has the resources and the skills to save Somalia. What is needed is the political will and the organizational drive to harness those resources and deploy those skills. We have no more urgent task. For all our honest endeavours  we live in a world beset by inequality  by gross disparities and imbalances of wealth and resources. So often do nature and society combine to perpetuate injustice that the sceptic might conclude that humanity's best efforts are more often than not unequal to the challenge. Our ""Agenda for Peace"" must embrace also an agenda for justice and compassion. This imperative was obscured by the cold war. It is perhaps understandable that throughout those dangerous years international attention and political energies were absorbed by questions of security. But the era of ideological confrontation is  happily  over and at an end. We must grasp this opportunity to build a more humane and just international system  a system that will focus on the welfare of the individual the need for food and shelter  for human rights  for political freedom and for equality. We cannot forget that the same Charter that assigns to the United Nations responsibility for preserving international peace and security also gives the United Nations major responsibilities for promoting social and economic development. The moral responsibility of the international donor community is clear. None of us finds it easy to allocate extra resources for aid in the current difficult economic climate  but we have an obligation to provide adequate humanitarian relief for immediate crises  as well as financial and technical assistance for longer-term development. For reasons of size and economic circumstances  the scope for Ireland to donate significant amounts of aid remains limited. However  I can say that private support in Ireland for non-governmental organizations involved in development has grown steadily. Today Ireland has the highest rate of private development assistance  as a proportion of gross national product  of all countries in the world. The Irish people have themselves shown their generosity  and the Irish Government aims to respond by increasing our official development assistance. But the effort called for is wider than development assistance. Notwithstanding the end of the cold war and the disappearance of East-West confrontation  the opportunities for international cooperation are not being grasped. It is simply unacceptable that most Africans are poorer today than they were 30 years ago  that in a world that spends a trillion dollars every year on weapons of the most sophisticated kind we cannot find the resources to provide bread and clean water for millions of our fellow citizens. What is missing is a clear political focus and  by definition  a clear  directed political will. Already the international community has made a connection between the environment and development. But there are other areas in which we must look for new and broader approaches: in the international financial and economic system; in spending on armaments; and in the way in which our international organizations work. Economic activity cannot be divorced from political responsibility. How welcome it would be if the quality of analysis and the clarity of direction contained in the Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace"" could be brought to bear on a new agenda an agenda for justice and development if  when we meet here again a year from now  we were to have a thorough report  bearing the authority of the Secretary-General  which would point the way forward on aid  trade  finance  commodities and debt  a report that would develop concrete proposals to remedy the organizational deficiencies that so often thwart our best intentions. I believe that in the years ahead the success of our Organization will be measured not only by its response to individual situations of conflict but also by the way in which it deals with these urgent questions of development. The end of East-West rivalry has not brought an end to conflict or threats to peace. On the contrary  many disputes frozen by the cold war have re-emerged with vicious and deadly impact. We must intensify our cooperation on international peace and security. The January summit of the Security Council was a timely initiative  which has led directly to the Secretary-General's ambitious and thought-provoking document ""An Agenda for Peace"". That document assembles a range of important ideas for consolidation of the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations  as well as for extension of the role of the United Nations into the new areas of preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-building. Ireland has long supported the peace-keeping activities of the United Nations. Today my country  small though it may be in population and in resources  participates in 10 of the 12 peace-keeping missions currently in the field. But  like the Secretary-General  we have felt the need to develop further the capacity of the United Nations to make and keep the peace. We therefore endorse the direction of the Secretary-General's thinking. I welcome in particular the attention given to preventive action. The earlier the United Nations can identify and act on a threat to the peace  the better are the chances of averting the outbreak or prospective outbreak of hostilities. The proposals for fact-finding missions  for improved early warning and for the preventive deployment of United Nations forces can and should be implemented now. We also support the Secretary-General's proposals for the strengthening of peace-keeping. The activities of the United Nations in this area are amongst the most innovative achievements of our age. We are prepared to work actively with the Secretariat and with other member States in coping with the new demands and problems that have emerged in relation to logistics  equipment  personnel and finance. I want to say a brief word about the financing of the United Nations. Here  I am struck by the Secretary-General's clear and urgent warning about the poor financial health of the Organization. At the very moment when the United Nations has begun to assume a more effective role in the interests of peace  when it is looked to by suffering people everywhere to provide protection and aid  its work is hampered by financial uncertainty. Let me put it simply: the Organization cannot function effectively  cannot meet the demands that we the members make upon it  unless all Member States pay their assessed contributions in full and on time. We call on all members to fulfil their financial obligations under the Charter  and we look to the General Assembly  at its current session  to adopt measures to put the Organization on a secure financial footing. I know that reform of the United Nations - and  in particular  of the Security Council is a sensitive issue that touches the very essence of post-war international cooperation. But  after almost 50 years it is reasonable to ask if the structures and methods of work agreed upon then correspond fully with contemporary realities with the growing  and now almost universal  membership of the United Nations; with the Organization's new tasks; and with the great changes that have taken place in economic and political relations. The time has come to take up these issues frankly here within the United Nations itself. We can only profit from such a discussion. Our aim should be to ensure that the decisions of the Organization are truly authoritative and representative of the will of the entire international community. One of the most significant achievements of this century has been the development of an ethic  a morality  of human rights. We have set our face uncompromisingly against violations of human rights - against torture  slavery  apartheid. It is simply not acceptable that an individual can be sacrificed to the interests of a State system rendered nameless  an afterthought as history marches on. Our modern ethic extends to the realization that human rights are essential in relations between States as well as in our national political systems. None of us can turn our backs on systematic violations of human rights or retain full trust and confidence in those responsible for such violations. To respect human rights is to respect conscience itself  whose power for good has been illustrated many times in the course of this century by a Mahatma Gandhi  by a Martin Luther King  or  in the past few years  by a Vaclav Havel or a Nelson Mandela  who  from a prison cell - ""enduring the most"" changed his country's history. By upholding the rights of the individual we bring the welfare and dignity of men and women to the centre of our political preoccupations. This must be the central message for next year's world conference on human rights  but I am deeply concerned that it is in danger of being lost sight of in the preparatory work. In this of all fields  we must escape from an adversarial approach and hold firmly in view the meaning of our work for the suffering of the many. I should like to make a few remarks in connection with disarmament. We cannot slacken in our determination to make progress on disarmament and arms control. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the development of new and sophisticated conventional weapons pose a major threat to international peace and security and to regional stability. I welcome the recent agreement in the Conference on Disarmament on the chemical-weapons Convention. I welcome too the accession of France and China to the nuclear-non-proliferation Treaty. As we prepare for the 1995 Review Conference  we appeal to those countries that remain outside the Treaty to join us in making the non-proliferation regime truly universal. This is a goal for which Ireland has long striven. The effort to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons and to end nuclear testing once and for all must be redoubled. Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction can have no place in our future security relations. The British Foreign Secretary has already spoken in the name of the twelve member States of the European Community about the major regional challenges confronting our world the Middle East  Cambodia  South Africa  Yugoslavia and other conflicts and I fully endorse his statements in that regard. Over the past year  the Irish Government has worked tirelessly for the resumption of political dialogue which might lead to a lasting and comprehensive settlement of the problem of Northern Ireland. I am happy to report that our efforts bore fruit with the recommencement some months ago of a process of dialogue and negotiation involving the Irish and the British Governments and the constitutional political parties in Northern Ireland. The shared objective of this process is ""to achieve a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland  within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands"". The Irish Government will do everything in its power to reach a settlement which will overcome present divisions and lay the foundations for lasting peace  stability and reconciliation among the Irish people. We believe such a settlement can be achieved only on the basis of the equal legitimacy of the two traditions which exist on our island. The nationalist and unionist traditions are equally valid. Each must be accorded equal respect and given meaningful political expression in new political arrangements. A valuable acknowledgement of the rights of the two traditions exists already in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Over the past seven years  the Agreement has performed an extremely valuable role as an instrument of cooperation between the Irish and British Governments on a wide range of matters relating to Northern Ireland. Issues which have received particular attention include relations between the security forces and the community in Northern Ireland; public confidence in the administration of justice; respect for human rights and the law; the prevention of discrimination wherever it exists and the development of greater North/South economic cooperation. The Irish Government has made it clear that we would be prepared to consider a new and more broadly based agreement or structure if such an arrangement can be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation between all of the parties concerned. The present talks are exploring that possibility. In our view  arrangements must build upon  rather than detract from  the crucial contribution made by the Anglo-Irish Agreement to political progress. It is our earnest hope that the process of dialogue which is under way at present  and in which I am personally participating  will lead to agreed arrangements which represent a fair and honourable accommodation between the two traditions on the island of Ireland. Nationalists and unionists must both feel that their political  civil  economic and social rights are fully protected and that structures are in place which respect and accommodate their respective aspirations. All of the participants in the present talks are committed to a forward-looking and constructive approach. For our part  we in the Irish Government are prepared to bring all the necessary reserves of good will and patience to bear in the search for an agreed outcome. The best hope of ultimate success lies in the insistent desire for peace on the part of the vast majority of Irish people  in both North and South  and our determination that the violence and turmoil which has been suffered over the past 23 years in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland shall not be visited upon future generations. Those who resort to violence in the pursuit of political aims are the enemies of the Irish people. They seek an Ireland built not on respect for the aspirations of each tradition but on bloodshed  hatred and despair. All the efforts of the Irish Government are directed towards the creation of conditions which will ensure that the scourge of violence is removed for ever. The only true path to peace  justice and stability lies in the healing of wounds and in reconciliation between the two traditions on a basis of complete equality. There is much that divides the two traditions but there is even more that unites us. The common ground between North and South  I have no doubt  will be significantly expanded by our joint progress over the years ahead along the road towards European union. By building on our shared values and objectives  we will bring closer the peaceful and stable future to which we all aspire. "
"75",3294,"IRN",47,1992,"At the outset  I should like to offer the President my most sincere congratulations on his well-deserved election to preside over the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly and to express my delegation's gratitude and appreciation for the constructive efforts of the President of the forty-sixth session. It is our earnest hope that the General Assembly  drawing upon our President's valuable experience and diplomatic skills  will play a significant role in the new international environment. I assure him of my delegation's full cooperation to this end. I also take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt felicitations to the new Members who have joined us in the United Nations since the last session of the General Assembly  most of whom are neighbours of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is a matter of great joy and satisfaction for me and my delegation that the seat of Afghanistan in the Assembly is at long last occupied by the representatives of the legitimate Government of that country. This session opens at a time  in the aftermath of the cold war  when tumultuous developments in the international arena continue to unfold  facing the international community with opportunities and challenges alike. In the cold-war era the global arms race  the arming of client States and the instigation of regional wars sapped the energy and capabilities of countries  especially in the third world  thus debilitating them in their efforts to stand up to the challenge of such chronic and endemic problems as poverty. hunger  illiteracy  drug-addiction and drug trafficking  underdevelopment and environmental pollution. The collapse of the bipolar world has created a propitious opportunity for mankind to address those problems in earnest. It has also brought to the fore new threats to international peace and security  such as the devising of new ways of expansion and consolidation of domination and hegemony  a further widening of the North-South gap and flare-ups of ethnic and racial differences and conflicts. Due to continuing transformations in geographical  economic  military and cultural configurations  the world today is in a vulnerable state of flux  and until reliable stability emerges the approach of big Powers to the United Nations and that of the Organization to international issues and problems will remain very sensitive and significant. The United Nations  as the only universal body  should contribute to the solution of major global problems without resort to short-sighted political expediency. It should do so on the basis of justice and respect for human dignity  lofty human values and the rules of international law. Selectivity is certain to turn the Organization into a tool for legitimizing the actions of powerful Member States. This represents the most formidable challenge to the Organization's integrity  credibility and relevance. In this context I need give just a few clear examples: first  in dealing with international crises  the use of double standards based on the political interests of the powerful  as manifested  on one hand  by the Security Council's treatment of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait and  on the other hand  by the decades-old aggression of the Zionist regime; secondly  the non-application  for reasons of political expediency  of the existing means and instruments to certain crises  as witnessed in the Council's half-hearted approach to Serbia's blatant aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; thirdly  indifference to  or total negligence of  certain explosive and tragic situations  such as those in Somalia and Liberia  which  despite obvious disruptive regional ramifications  do not seem to have a direct bearing on the interests of outside Powers; fourthly  the manipulation of cherished human ideals in the field of human rights for short-sighted  ulterior political motives. Undoubtedly  a fair  objective and non-selective approach by the United Nations to international issues and crises will help to ensure that the Organization can play an effective role in the future and  away from the peddling of big-Power influence  put it in the unique position of being able to act as the centre for concerted international cooperation. At this point I must express to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our appreciation for his efforts to make the Organization more efficient and to enhance its role in the resolution of chronic and new international problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran has studied with care and keen interest the Secretary-General's report of 17 June 1992  entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"". It is our considered view that the report deals with a wide range of theoretical and practical issues issues that are very sensitive and merit the General Assembly's careful and in-depth scrutiny. It is incumbent on the General Assembly  as the only universal organ of the United Nations  to formulate and adopt the Organization's future work. Such an endeavour  within the framework of the Charter and based on full respect for the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of Member States and on non-interference in their internal affairs  will certainly contribute to refinement of the concepts and suggestions embodied in the Secretary-General's report  and this will help him to discharge his duties. My delegation is willing to participate actively in a special working group of the General Assembly on this matter. Among the most sensitive issues dealt with in the Secretary-General's report is the active role of the Security Council in the new international environment. The Security Council  in accordance with the United Nations Charter  bears primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  but  in the discharge of its responsibilities  the Council does not have unfounded authority. By definition  it must fine-tune its decisions and actions with the principles and objectives of the Charter and of international law. Discriminatory treatment of issues pertaining to international peace and security  the overstepping of mandated authority and misuse of the privileges accorded to the members of the Council the permanent members in particular are among the practices that tarnish the Council's image and undermine its stature and credibility and  in the final analysis  that of the United Nations. A thorough and vigorous study and formulation of well-defined guidelines will help the Council to adopt an objective and non-discriminationary approach  within a specific framework and specific terms of reference  to various issues of international peace and security. I must emphasize that the preservation of international peace and security is a responsibility entrusted to the Security Council by the international community. That being the case  the Council  in accordance with the Charter  is accountable to that community  which is represented by the General Assembly. The existing international exigencies make especially necessary the strengthening of global efforts to facilitate the overall process of disarmament and arms control - in particular  the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. To this end  reappraisal of the military doctrines of the big Powers in consonance with the new international situation  a change in attitudes of domination  and rejection of resort to force as a means of promoting political objectives constitute the primary prerequisite for the success of all disarmament and arms-control schemes. The preparation of a draft convention on the prohibition of the production  development  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons represents a significant step in the history of arms control. Undoubtedly  this convention crystallizes many years' difficult  even tedious  negotiations between the members of the Conference on Disarmament. Notwithstanding this obvious fact  the convention - on the one hand  because the Conference on Disarmament acts on the basis of consensus and  on the other  owing to the supremacy of political exigencies throughout the process  but especially during the latter stages - cannot be regarded as a document that reflects the principled views and positions of all members of the Conference on Disarmament. This is particularly true in respect of the composition of the executive council  which  in our view  lacks balance and proportion. Furthermore  if the convention on chemical weapons is to become universal the developed countries will have to provide for the transfer of chemical technology  materials and equipment for peaceful purposes  and the existing unilateral discriminatory and ad hoc restrictions will have to be removed. In the field of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  the non-proliferation Treaty can indeed acquire a universal character and play an effective and efficient role in preventing the vertical and horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons  provided that the nuclear-weapon States fulfil their obligations in accordance with article VI of the Treaty. It is highly desirable that the next millennium be nuclear-free  but the achievement of that objective depends upon the following: an undertaking by all nuclear-weapon States to destroy all nuclear weapons in their territory or under their jurisdiction or control; a new pledge by all States not to acquire or proliferate nuclear weapons and not to add to their existing stocks; and a genuine commitment to enhanced cooperation in technology for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.  Further regional endeavours in the field of arms control  regional disarmament and the establishment of zones free of weapons of mass destruction can complement international efforts towards the prohibition of such weapons and can contribute to the alleviation of the international community's concern about the dangerous consequences of stockpiling armaments at the regional level.  My country  as the initiator of the proposal for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East  is fully prepared to participate actively in any constructive and comprehensive initiative in this field. It goes without saying  though  that the success of initiatives concerning arms control and regional disarmament depends on heeding a number of considerations such as the political and security characteristics of the regions in question  participation of the regional countries in defining the principles and objectives of the initiative  the concerns of the countries in the region vis-a-vis threats from within and outside the region  including consequences of the presence of foreign forces. What seems more urgent and critical than regional disarmament is the necessity and desirability of searching for a comprehensive and genuine solution to regional conflicts  as an endemic and seemingly intractable source of threat to international peace and security. Over and above the chronic regional crises  recent developments at the international level have given birth to a series of new crises in various regions  thus further accentuating the need for a new sense of vigilance and vigorous endeavour on the part of the international community to confront these threats. In my brief survey of regional crises and conflicts  I cannot but begin with what is closest to the hearts and minds of the Islamic world - that is  Palestine. The legitimate uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories  as a form of resistance against occupation  expansionism  murder and unbearable living conditions  is brutally suppressed. Alongside the regular armed forces  armed Zionist settlers carry out on a daily and continuing basis acts of murder and plunder  including confiscation of Palestinian property. In addition to Palestine  parts of Syrian and Lebanese territory are still under Zionist occupation and innocent people are killed or abducted on a regular basis by these forces in South Lebanon. The Islamic Republic of Iran calls on the international community to confront the aggressive and repressive policies of the Zionists in a serious and meaningful manner. The bitter experience of the past decades indicate  however  that peace and tranquillity can be restored to the area only through struggle  full restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the entire territory of Palestine. Another crisis which has endangered regional and global security over the past year concerns the tragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The crimes perpetrated against the people in that young and small Republic have few parallels in the post-Second-World-War era. The aggression against the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of a Member of the United Nations and the simultaneous torture  mass killings and policy of genocide and ""ethnic cleansing""  as pursued by Serbia and its ultra-nationalist Serb agents with the objective of forming ""greater Serbia""  have caused deep consternation throughout the world and drawn condemnation from almost all quarters. Nevertheless  Serbia and its agents continue to show utter disdain for the international community's decisions  as reflected in numerous Security Council resolutions and General Assembly resolution 46/242  continuing their crimes against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina  in particular the Muslim population  with a seeming sense of immunity and impunity. It is therefore incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt the necessary measures provided for in Article 42 of the Charter to put an end to the aggression and to restore the sovereignty  territorial integrity  political independence and unity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Islamic Republic of Iran once again emphasizes the inherent right of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter and expects the Security Council to reconsider its resolution on an arms embargo against Yugoslavia in order to enable the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise its inherent right to resist aggression. Moreover  I would like to emphasize that in the view of a large majority of the Member States  including the Islamic Republic of Iran  the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has no right to occupy the seat of former Yugoslavia in international forums. We strongly believe that the Assembly should send a very clear and unambiguous signal to Belgrade  through the expulsion of Serbia and Montenegro from all organs of the United Nations  that to be a Member of the Organization it will be subject to all the criteria for membership and will have to behave accordingly. There are two other continuing crises in the immediate neighborhood of the Islamic Republic of Iran to which my country cannot remain indifferent because of humanitarian as well as national security considerations. Expressing its satisfaction at the victory of the Muslim mujahidin of Afghanistan and the establishment of an Islamic State  the Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes the cessation of fratricidal bloodshed in its fraternal neighbouring country. My country extends its support to the legitimate Government of Afghanistan  stresses the imperative of non-interference of all countries in the internal affairs of Afghanistan  and once again draws the attention of the international community to the pressing humanitarian needs of the war-stricken Afghan people. For our part  we have made endeavours in this direction and underline our readiness to cooperate with other countries as well as international organizations in the provision of food  medicine and other essential needs as well as in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. In regard to the Nogorno-Karabakh region  the Islamic Republic of Iran from the very outset expressed its concern at the continuation and expansion of the conflict and exerted every effort to bring the fighting to an end; this resulted in the establishment of a cease-fire and commencement of negotiations between the Republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia. It is a matter of deep regret that owing to the reticence of the international community - and particularly that of the Security Council the opportunity of propitious situation which existed at that time and which could have been further solidified through the dispatching of international observers was lost and bloodshed flared up and has continued. In our view  the Karabakh crisis can be resolved only through negotiations and on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference as well as the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries. The approach of the Islamic Republic of Iran to these two crises and the efforts undertaken in regard to them emanate from our overall policy towards neighbouring countries  which is based on the promotion and consolidation of good-neighbourly relations  expansion of economic  cultural and scientific cooperation  and fostering of regional confidence. For we believe that security in our region is attainable only through cooperation. As early as 1986 the Islamic Republic of Iran  on the basis of this policy  underlined the imperative need for the creation of a regional security and cooperation arrangement in the Persian Gulf area. In the General Assembly last year I enumerated the principles and objectives of such regional cooperation principles and objectives that continue to govern our approach to this strategic region. The relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the newly established Republics along our northern borders are based on the same principles  namely  respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity  inviolability of international borders  non-resort to force in the settlement of disputes  non-interference in internal affairs  and dialogue and mutual understanding. Cognizant of the fact that the newly established republics of Central Asia and the Caucasus are now undergoing the difficult and tumultuous stage of state-building  establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and economic stabilization and development  and with a view to the primacy of promotion of good-neighbourly relations and fostering of mutual confidence between the countries of this region  the Islamic Republic of Iran has taken the lead in the sphere of expanding bilateral as well as multilateral ties with these countries. We  along with our regional partners - Turkey and Pakistan have welcomed the Republics of Azerbaijan  Turkmenistan  Tajikistan  Uzbekistan  Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO). We also pioneered the formation of the Organization of the Countries of the Caspian Sea Basin  along with the Russian Federation  Azerbaijan  Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. In the bilateral field  the foundations of political  cultural and economic cooperation  particularly in the areas of transportation and energy  have been laid with the newly established republics of the former USSR. That approach by the Islamic Republic of Iran is founded on the conviction that the expansion of bilateral and multilateral relations among countries of the region is bound to contribute to stability  security and development for all. In today's world instability does not emanate solely from regional crises or military conflicts. Economic and environmental problems too threaten international peace and security. Continued further exacerbation of economic difficulties in most third-world countries in the context  and as a result  of the ever-widening gap between the North and the South is perhaps the most serious and most explosive danger threatening the international community. As stated clearly in the World Economic Survey for 1992  world economic output has decreased for the first time since the Second World War; international trade is also plagued with myriad difficulties. Under these difficult circumstances  many developing countries are still grappling with the problems resulting from the economic recession of the 1980s and its socio-political consequences. Worse still  a decreased flow of financial resources to developing countries has made the prospects for recovery and economic growth and development in those countries all the more uncertain.  Notwithstanding numerous problems  the recovery of the world economy is not impossible to achieve. Its attainment  though  requires promotion of international cooperation and coordination of economic policies  which feature among the major purposes of the United Nations. To this end  the International Development Strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade  the Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its eighteenth special session  and Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which reflect long and intensive negotiations and represent international consensus on the objectives of development and environment  constitute the necessary framework and basis of future measures. Yet it is clear that in the absence of concerted international cooperation proper economic conditions where all countries enjoy equal opportunity for growth and development will remain unattainable. The United Nations and its specialized agencies provide the most appropriate forum to facilitate international cooperation with the objective of alleviating world economic problems  especially those of the developing countries  thus preventing what otherwise seems an inevitable confrontation between North and South. In conclusion  I would like to reiterate the imperative of intensifying the activities of the United Nations in step with international developments  with a view to achieving a higher degree of efficiency and effectiveness. In this context  the Islamic Republic of Iran is of the view that revitalization of the General Assembly should be pursued in earnest  and that effective measures to augment the efficiency  and thus the practical relevance  of the Assembly should be adopted. The decision of the recent non-aligned summit to convene a high-level working group to study ways and means of increasing the effectiveness of the United Nations represents a timely  logical and positive step  and can certainly assist the United Nations in that purpose. The General Assembly  as the sole universal  democratic and transparent organ of the United Nations  with the competence entrusted to it by the Charter to address all international issues and problems  should fully exercise its Charter-mandated authority in practice. To that end  the General Assembly should guide other organs of the United Nations on a constant and active basis  and take the necessary decisions and make the appropriate recommendations for the realization of common human ideals  most notably universal peace  security and respect for human rights  and balanced prosperity and welfare.

"76",3341,"IRQ",47,1992,"It	gives me pleasure to convey my sincere congratulations to Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am confident that he will devote his rich experience and diplomatic expertise to ensuring the success of this session.I am also pleased to welcome the new States that have recently joined the membership of the United Nations.The great hopes for the emergence of a world enjoying peace  stability  economic growth  justice  and equality for all remain in all our minds. But we cannot help wondering whether the international community is any closer today to realizing these hopes than it was in the past. The rapid developments and radical changes that have taken place in the world since 1989 still continue apace. These developments and changes have led the world situation to the threshold of a new era  whose features have not become clear yet. He can say  however  that our world today - despite the end of' the ideological conflict that divided a large part of the world into two blocs  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Harsaw Pact - continues to be unstable  and continues to be prey to racial conflicts and armed disputes in Europe  Asia  Africa  and Latin America.On the other hand  the economic crisis has intensified  bringing greater misery to the developing countries  which experience famines of unprecedented magnitude in modern history. All indications point to an exacerbation of the division of the world into North and South  a world without equality  justice  or equity between the rich and strong countries of the North and the poor and weak countries of the South. These signs also warn against the advent of a new era of big-Power hegemony not only over weaker States but also over all international organizations with a view to using them as instruments to implement their policies and serve their interests.The challenges which face us  particularly in the developing countries  make it imperative for the United Nations to discharge its responsibilities under the Charter  with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security  within the framework of a world order in which the United Nations  through the collective will of all its Member States  should play an effective and influential role in protecting the sovereignty and independence of the Member States and in achieving the economic and social development which constitutes the greatest and principal challenge to the developing countries.However  actual reality shows that the United Nations  which continues to strive to attain these aspirations  faces many obstacles that impede its progress towards them. The most prominent hurdle is the attempt by one State or group of States to impose hegemony over the policies of the United Nations and its institutions. The most flagrant aspect of that hegemony is what has been taking place in the Security Council since the course of international changes acquired its new  accelerated pace. As a result of this hegemony  which is being spearheaded and intensified by the United States of America  resolutions and measures adopted by the Security Council have become conspicuous for their double standard and selectivity in applying the text of the United Nations Charter. In so doing  the Security Council has distanced itself from the letter and spirit of the principles enshrined in the Charter and from the provisions of international law and the principles of justice and fairness that are necessary if a balance is to be maintained between the obligations and the rights of Member States. There is no doubt that this imbalance will lead inevitably to opportunistic dealings that may very well stem from the ability of the stronger to deal and not from the foundations established in the Charter for the relationship between the Council and Member States. Such a state of affairs would pose a grave threat to peace and security on both the regional and the international levels.What Iraq has been subjected to over the past two years  and the practices it continues to face under the cover of so-called international legality  are the most telling examples of double standards selectivity  and of the failure to strike a balance between rights and obligations.The will of the Security Council has become divorced from the Charter and its resolutions have been transformed into political practices aimed at destabilizing a State Member of the United Nations  undermining its security  starving its people and depriving its sick and ailing citizens of the medicine they need. All this is being done to serve declared political objectives that in no way relate to the letter or spirit of the United Nations Charter or to the rules of international law.In the name of international legality and under its cover  Iraq has been made the victim of an all-out war that has destroyed its economic installations and the infrastructures of its civilian life in a manner that is unprecedented in modern history. The motive behind this overkill and arbitrary use of armed force against Iraq was to throw a whole people back into the pre-industrial age  as then United States Secretary of State Baker told the Iraqi Foreign Minister  Tariq Aziz  in the course of their Geneva meeting on 9 January 1991. The studies and reports of the United Nations  the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations have highlighted the magnitude of the destruction inflicted upon Iraq as a result of that aggression and the subsequent huge losses sustained as a result of the blockade and the embargo. I do not need to go into the details of those reports  which contain the findings of people commissioned by the United Nations and which have been distributed as official United Nations documents.Notwithstanding all the excesses and the untold iniquities perpetrated against Iraq  we have striven in all sincerity and earnestness to honor our commitments vis-a-vis the resolutions of the Security Council and to cooperate with United Nations organs in doing all that is required of Iraq in every field. Many acts of provocation have been committed by persons who have been planted in the mechanisms entrusted with the implementation of Security Council resolutions with the aim of obstructing Iraq's discharge of its commitments and thereby making Iraq appear to be rejecting the resolutions of the Security Council. The obvious aim has been the creation of a climate that would justify new military strikes against Iraq and block any consideration of lifting the unjust and iniquitous blockade imposed upon it.However  we have been able to foil the efforts aimed at achieving that evil objective and all the attempts made with the aim of creating crises between the United Nations and Iraq have been contained. Iraq has demonstrated full cooperation with the United Nations in order to ensure the sound and balanced implementation of the resolutions of the Security Council.While Iraq is earnestly striving to implement its commitments vis-a-vis Security Council resolutions  we have yet to see the Council take any step towards lifting the blockade or even loosening its economic shackles which it has imposed upon the people of Iraq and which have had very grave effects indeed on the daily lives of the Iraqi people at every level.It has become evident from the firm determination of the Security Council not to ease the comprehensive economic sanctions imposed upon Iraq that the Council does not follow the rule of balancing obligations and rights  but is rather acting in line with declarations of the officials of the countries that exercise hegemony over the Council that the economic blockade against Iraq will never be lifted until Iraq's political system is overthrown.Here  we feel entitled to pose a question to the whole world from this rostrum  asking whether the Security Council  in dealing thus with a State Member of the United Nations  has acted on the basis of the provisions of the Charter  international law and the principles of justice and fairness  or whether the Council has succumbed to the will and diktat of the Powers that exercise hegemony over it with a view to serving those Powers' interests before all else.The present relationship between the Security Council and Iraq does not fall within the framework of implementing the resolutions of the Council but rather within the framework of implementing the foreign policy objectives of a very limited number of States. If those States  which are led by dubious policies in the United States  were to be given a free hand  then the grave danger would spill over beyond Iraq and engulf other nations; it would spill over beyond the present and engulf the future. The campaigns of threats and intimidation under the cover of the Charter continue unabated in order to create the appropriate climate for continuing the economic blockade against Iraq and justifying new military strikes against it with the aim of destabilizing its political system and finishing off its vital economic installations and infrastructures which are still suffering from the impact of the first military strike. A flagrant example of the injustices to which Iraq is being subjected within the framework of this relationship can be seen in the practices of the sanctions Committee set up under Security Council resolution 661 (1991). This Committee too is subject to the rule of veto despite its camouflage as a committee conducting its work on the basis of consensus.As I have informed the Secretary-General in official letters citing factual instances  a review of that Committee's work would show how the objection of one or two members of the Committee is sufficient to prevent any response to Iraq's basic needs and even to make it ignore the special exemptions stated in the resolutions concerning civilian needs in such spheres as food  electricity  agriculture  water and sewage  medical and educational requirements  and clothing. Iraq has been allowed  in theory  to import food and medicine. But  for two years now  Iraqi assets have been frozen while Iraq has not been able to sell any oil or export any other commodity in order to pay for its basic humanitarian needs. On top of all this  we see attempts now being made to seize completely Iraqi frozen assets abroad through a draft resolution currently tabled before the Security Council. This draft resolution has no justification or legality whatsoever  not even in the light of the pretexts contained in the draft itself. Iraq has cooperated  in good faith and in earnest  with the United Nations Secretariat in order to reach an agreement on the export of quantities of Iraqi oil and the use of the revenues thereof to provide for basic civilian needs and cover United Nations costs. The reason an agreement is yet to be reached has been the refusal of certain countries in the Security Council to remove from any prospective agreement their humiliating political preconditions  which are not in any way related to the substance of the agreement desired.Iraq is prepared to address this question according to the following formula first  that Iraq be allowed to export crude oil and oil products to produce a net return of no less than $4 billion for a period of six months  which may be extended for a further period if by then the embargo of Iraqi oil exports has not been completely lifted.Secondly  that the net returns of the exports be deposited in an escrow account set up by the United Nations  then to be used for the purchase of foodstuffs  medicines and other essential civilian needs  the importation of which will be subject to the special measures of the Committee established under Security Council resolution 661 (1990).Thirdly  that the Security Council name certain countries from which goods may be purchased according to normal commercial practices. Iraq is prepared to grant 5 per cent of the net return of this operation to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as a contribution towards international relief work in Somalia/ for the benefit of the Palestinian people through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East  in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other areas.This will be donated in keeping with Iraq's humanitarian principles and outlook. In April 1991 the United Nations began its humanitarian relief program to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people with simple and limited means. Interference from parties hostile to Iraq began to surface in order to influence the course of the program by using it as a pretext and a gateway through which to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq. It became clear that the program dealt with the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people according to the political desires  intentions and schemes of the countries presenting the aid  a fact attested to by some officials in the program.Therefore  the humanitarian program has not assumed  in actual application  the effectiveness that would have made it possible to achieve its desired humanitarian objectives. Iraq reiterates the necessity for the United Nations humanitarian program to remain within the framework of purely humanitarian objectives  away from political considerations and from the tendency to interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq. We are prepared to cooperate in the achievement of any purely humanitarian goal sought by the United Nations. Calls and allegations are increasingly made about alleged violations of human rights in Iraq. The parties that waged a destructive war on Iraq in the name of international legality would like to forget that the suffering of the people of Iraq resulted from their own actions which constitute the most flagrant violation of human rights witnessed by humanity in all its history.I ask here  before this international gathering: what words can describean action in which one hundred twenty-five thousand tons of explosives were dropped on the people of Iraq  bringing death to thousands of its children  men and women of all ages  and raining destruction upon all its vital economic installations  its civilian  residential centers and its schools  hospitals  formula milk plants  kindergartens and houses of worship? Is this not a most flagrant violation of human rights and negation of all moral and human values and standards  in addition to being a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the covenants related to it?The false accusations being leveled at Iraq are the stuff of lies  rumors and distortions. They go nowhere near the very minimum of any objective  impartial or reasoned approach.The real motive behind this orchestrated vociferous campaign is to serve the very same political objectives that were behind the military aggression perpetrated against Iraq and that are still operative in the continued economic blockade against Iraq  the starving of its people  the trumped up pretexts of interference in its internal affairs and the undermining of its national unity. The so-called no-fly zone over southern Iraq has been imposed by a decision of the United States  Britain and France  this time nakedly  without any Security Council cover  thus underscoring the flagrant aggressive policy currently pursued in order to partition Iraq rather than defend its ""civilians""/ as the Western imperialist countries claim while they maintain their embargo against Iraq after having killed thousands of its civilian population through an aerial onslaught with bombs whose explosive force equaled that of a number of atomic bombs of the type that removed Hiroshima from the face of the earth. It is these very countries that continue to impose an embargo even on toys for the children of Iraq.No one can deny that the main cause of suffering among the people of Iraq was the military aggression that destroyed Iraq's economic infrastructure and brought to a halt its services. The suffering has also been caused  and further intensified  by the continued imposition of this iniquitous blockade  which has visited yet more economic hardship and human suffering on the people of Iraq  in addition to continued foreign interference in the internal affairs of the country  the creation of problems and fueling of internal conflicts and obstruction of the efforts of the central Government to carry out their duties and discharge their responsibilities towards the maintenance of law and order and preserve security and stability.The only way to put an end to this injustice and ensure some justice is to lift the embargo imposed upon Iraq and allow its people to rebuild what has been destroyed and resume their normal life. With its known potential  Iraq is a country that can do without donations given by this or that country as acover for well-known intentions. Indeed  Iraq can participate effectively in providing humanitarian assistance to countries in other regions of the world where such assistance is needed  once it regains its economic health. It had been providing such assistance before the blockade. Instances of this are numerous indeed  in Asia  Africa and Latin America  and many of the representatives listening to this statement know quite well that this is a fact.The circumstances which were used as a pretext for imposing the blockade against Iraq no longer exist. Therefore  lifting the blockade is an urgent necessity on the legal and humanitarian levels. As a matter of fact  this step ought to have been taken immediately after the disappearance of the circumstances to which I have just referred. Persistence in imposing the blockade constitutes a naked violation of the letter and spirit of the Security Council resolutions  contravenes all humanitarian principles and values  and must make it clear to the representatives here  as it has made clear to us  that the reasons behind it are and have been the inhuman intentions harbored against Iraq by well-known parties  now and in the past.It is indeed  in the interest of the human rights of the people of Iraq  that neighboring countries should abide by the terms of international agreements and undertakings and desist from sending infiltrators into our country to perpetrate acts of murder  robbery and plunder against persons and property of the civilian population  as well as against the State assets  just as they perpetrated their criminal acts against us in March and April 1991  as I believe everyone now knows.The Security Council's silence with regard to the criminal acts andoperations of military aggression perpetrated in Palestine  Lebanon and other occupied Arab territories by the pampered and American-veto-protected Zionist entity are the most damning proof that the practices of the Security Council are devoid of justice and international legality because of the total domination by the United States over the Council and its procedures.The violations that the Zionist entity has committed over the years  and continues to commit with impunity  against the people of Palestine and the other occupied Arab territories - in breach of the principles enshrined in the Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions of 1949  as well as in resolutions of the United Nations would take an entire volume to list if those Israeli practices were to be classified according to the breach of every article and paragraph dealing with human rights and the rights of nations.In return for all these policies of aggression and expansionism  the annexation of lands  the displacement of populations  and the killing and repression of civilians under military occupation  the Zionist entity receives nothing less than ever increasing political  military and economic aid which enables it to persist with impunity in its policies of aggression against the Palestinian people and its denial of their most basic and inalienable right the right to return to their homeland and to establish an independent State in Palestine under the leadership of their sole legitimate representative  the PLO.On the other hand  the importance of the Security Council vis-a-vis the armed conflicts that are currently raging in a number of regions  and its inability to address the attendant human tragedies as in the case of Somalia  whose plight is one of the most horrendous human calamities  are further proof of the double standards and politically motivated considerations that govern the conduct of the Security Council and the measures that it adopts in accordance with the wishes and dictates of the United States of America - the Power that dominates the Council.I wish  in conclusion  to point out that the peoples of the world as a whole do look forward to the day when the United Nations will play a real and effective role in bringing about a world of security  stability and prosperity. However  that day will come only when the Organization applies the letter and spirit of its Charter and the principles of international law in dealing with the major issues of mankind. That day will come only when the United Nations refuses to bow to any pressure or blackmail and  thereby  avoids becoming hostage to the will of the big Powers and refuses to be sidetracked from the noble human objectives that it was established to achieve.Unless such a state of affairs pertains clearly and decisively  as the States of the world that are jealous of their independence and freedom hope  the world will suffer disastrous consequences and the very foundations of the United Nations will be weakened as non-compliance with the United Nations Charter would put into question the very credibility of the Organization  and that might result in bringing upon it the same fate that overtook the old League of Nations  or some such undesirable fate."
"77",3388,"ISL",47,1992," I wish to join previous speakers in congratulating Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency. I am glad to see this important office occupied by a representative of one of Europe's new democracies. This year 13 new Members are joining our Organization: nine former Soviet republics as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Slovenia and San Marino. Iceland sincerely welcomes them all and looks forward to working with them in this forum in the future. The present is in many ways a time of remarkable opportunities for the United Nations.' The continued improvement of the international situation has over the past year inspired our Organization with a bold new optimism. We now have a realistic chance of breathing new life into the United Nations Charter and working in concert for the betterment of the world we live in. It is a chance none of us can afford to miss. Since the last session of the General Assembly important strides have been made towards the establishment of a safer and more predictable international environment. Progress has been substantial in the area of arms control and disarmament. For over 40 years the peoples of the world have been haunted by the spectre of nuclear holocaust. Owing largely to the fundamental changes that have taken place in the former Soviet Union  the role of nuclear weapons is quickly diminishing. The announcement by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin last June of dramatic cuts in the strategic arsenals of their countries was an important milestone in this regard. The draft Convention on chemical weapons  adopted by the Conference on Disarmament earlier this month  represents another major step towards the eventual elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction. The deterrence of war  a guiding principle of the cold war  is giving way to a different demand: the preservation of peace. As the emphasis shifts from military to economic and political means of obtaining security in effect from strategy to diplomacy the United Nations should also be given increasing scope for action. Diplomacy is bringing gains in regional disputes that have long been major issues on the United Nations agenda. In the Middle East a historic breakthrough has taken place with the initiation of the peace process started at Madrid. Forty-four years after the establishment of the State of Israel  Israelis and Palestinians are finally sitting at the same table and negotiating their differences. Setbacks notwithstanding  important steps have been taken by the Government of South Africa to abolish the notorious system of apartheid. Not least among the positive aspects of recent events is the growing recognition of the legitimate role of the United Nations in upholding collective security. In only four years the total of new United Nations peace-keeping operations has equalled the number of such operations over a period of 40 years previously. Clearly  however. United Nations peace-keeping will be viable only as long as the political will to deploy peace-keeping forces is matched by the resources to sustain them. A great deal has been achieved  raising hopes for the future of our Organization. But this is not the time for complacency. There are still serious stumbling blocks on the road to genuine peace and security. Overcoming them requires redoubled efforts by the world community and individual States. Reductions in nuclear arsenals  already agreed  will take years to accomplish. In the meantime  proliferation of dangerous weapons will continue apace  unless measures are taken to combat this menace effectively. Should our combined efforts fail  we may face a paradoxical situation in which the world becomes less dependent on nuclear weapons but at the same time more unstable and more militarized. Furthermore  violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms are still taking place on a large scale. The United Nations has been successful in the progressive development and codification of human rights. But setting standards is not enough. We must also ensure that they are respected. It is in that spirit that Iceland looks forward to next year's World Conference on Human Rights. We sincerely hope that the final outcome of the Conference will be a stepping stone towards a more effective implementation of human-rights standards all round the world. While the ice cap of the cold war has melted  national and ethnic rivalries have been rekindled  creating new dangers of regional instability. Ominous seeds of future intolerance and violence may have been sown through the appalling human-rights abuses and outright atrocities committed in some of the States of the former Yugoslavia. In a brutal conflict like the one we are witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina there are always shades of grey between black and white. No single party can be assigned sole responsibility. However  the territorial gains made by one of the parties  its overwhelming military superiority and the ethnic origin and number of refugees are uncontested facts which eloquently speak for themselves. All efforts unilaterally to change internationally recognized boundaries must be unreservedly condemned  as must the barbarous practice of ""ethnic cleansing""- At the same time  all parties to the conflict must be brought to realize that a solution can be found only through peaceful means and not on the battlefield. The relevant measures of the Security Council  including sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  must be scrupulously adhered to. In this context  Iceland welcomes the results of the recent London Conference and looks forward to its follow-up in Geneva. Tragic circumstances in the former Yugoslavia must not  however  be allowed to divert our attention from the deplorable situation which currently prevails in war-torn and famine-stricken Somalia. A quarter of Somali children have already died from malnutrition and disease this year  and a million more are similarly at risk in the coming months. Effective international coordination of relief efforts  including improved coordination between all relevant United Nations bodies  is the key to any improvement of the situation. Moreover  we must draw proper lessons from this unfortunate and disastrous experience and spare no effort to ensure that our Organization can respond in a timely and more effective manner to catastrophes like the one in Somalia. Returning to Europe  we find that parts of the legacy of the last 40 years have not yet been successfully eradicated. Last year we welcomed the three Baltic States  Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania  as sovereign Members of the United Nations. The continued stationing of foreign troops on the soil of those countries without their consent and in the absence of a firm timetable for withdrawal remains  however  a source of serious concern. At their meeting in Bornholm last month the Prime Ministers of the five Nordic countries emphasized that the earliest possible withdrawal of foreign military forces from the three Baltic States would contribute to the stability of the region as a whole. Iceland welcomes the recent accord on a troop pull-out from Lithuania by August next year  and hopes that the agreement will herald an orderly  complete and unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from all three Baltic States. Such anachronisms notwithstanding  the passing of the cold war has  on the whole  created new openings in the areas of economic  social and environmental cooperation. This applies not least in the area of trade. At a time when the virtues of free trade are extolled by East and West alike and the importance of having a clear and predictable framework for world trade is greater than ever  it is paradoxical that the Uruguay Round  launched more than six years ago  should be running two years behind schedule and even be in danger of imminent collapse. At stake are billions of dollars worth of world trade  as well as countless new job opportunities. We cannot afford to give up. Surrender would stall growth in the industrialized countries and slow down the integration of the developing countries and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe into the world trade system. We have to introduce the principles of free trade that have served us so well in industry into hitherto protected sectors  such as agriculture and fisheries. It would  of course  hardly be realistic to expect all 108 participants in the Uruguay Round to be equally satisfied with the results. The essential point  however  is that a general agreement that all can live with is now within reach. As the Director-General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  Mr. Dunkel  recently pointed out  ""the Uruguay Round is a single undertaking. The results are to be seen in an overall  integrated package. There is no pick and choose""-A reasonably satisfactory groundwork has been laid for the years ahead. The future stability of world trade now hinges on two of the main players  the European Community and the United States. If they can reach agreement  the Uruguay Round will soon be concluded. If they do not  there are turbulent  even chaotic times ahead. Both players must shoulder their responsibilities towards the rest of the world. The issues that remain unresolved are not of a nature to justify yet another postponement  which would in fact mean the end of the Uruguay Round. We cannot afford to let the Uruguay Round founder on the unjustified claims of a rural minority for protection and subsidies. The contribution of agriculture to gross domestic product has dropped drastically in the developed world  but support for and protection of agriculture has increased. Free-trade forces in manufacturing and services are more advanced than they are in agriculture  and it is noteworthy that in recent years subsidies to manufacturing in the developed world have declined. Among the most important commitments embodied in the United Nations Charter is the determination of our countries to promote social progress and better standards of living in conditions of greater freedom. But over the last 10 years social conditions in a number of countries have actually declined. More than 1 billion people live in absolute poverty. What is needed is for all nations represented in the Assembly to rise above their disagreements and act together to relieve the plight of those living under conditions of abject misery. Iceland supports  therefore  the proposal to convene a world summit for social development in 1995. This year marks the end of the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons. The implementation of the objectives of the World Programme of Action has  when all is said and done  been disappointing. We must respect our pledges to the world's half billion persons with disabilities and recommit ourselves to the objective of creating equal opportunities for all people. In the past few years we have become increasingly aware of the interrelationship between the state of the environment and advances in human rights and social development. As was already noted by that distinguished representative of the best tradition of European humanism  Willy Brandt  12 years ago: ""It can no longer be argued that protection of the environment is an obstacle to development. On the contrary  the care of the natural environment is an essential aspect of development"". The success of efforts to deal with global environmental problems and a long-term strategy to achieve sustainable development will depend in large part on how we manage population growth. At the present growth rate the human race is likely to double in less than half a century. Obviously  all nations  rich and poor alike  owe it to succeeding generations to cooperate in achieving a major revision of social policies in the field of population control. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro was a landmark event  as was evidenced by the wide participation in the Conference. Its achievements provide a sound basis for further work. In order to safeguard our planet from otherwise-inevitable ecological disaster  we must agree on targets and measures that will lead us towards sustainable development. During the past year there have been no indications that the state of the global environment is improving or that we have managed to turn the tide. On the contrary  findings earlier this year which show a further depletion of ozone in the stratosphere are of great concern. Recent disclosures of massive discharges of radioactive waste and other hazardous materials into the Barents and Kara Seas from the former Soviet Union could also be an indication of an ecological time bomb. These and many similar dangers have made the Earth appear smaller than ever before and demonstrate the need for enhanced international cooperation and stronger national commitment to environmental protection. Turning to the follow-up to the Rio Conference  Iceland considers the prevention of marine pollution  as well as efforts to ensure sustainable utilization of all marine living resources  to be of fundamental importance. The oceans are not only a crucial part of the respiratory system of our planet but also an indispensable source of food for mankind. The requirements of basic human subsistence make it imperative that the living resources of the sea remain available for human consumption. Moreover  marine resources could become one of the most important assets of developing countries as they strive for sustainable development. Iceland therefore particularly welcomes the unanimous decision taken at the Rio Conference to convene an international conference to address the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources. As pollution endangers our natural environment  so there are other noxious influences which threaten to corrupt our societies from within. Drug abuse is a global problem which threatens the security and stability of many countries and is a serious social problem in most countries of the world. The drug problem is'a multi-faceted one. We must continue to fight  with real solutions which touch on all its facets  including ways to diminish demand  production and trafficking. Drug-trafficking is increasingly an organized crime  victimizing mainly our youth. More effective leadership  based on a more definite mandate from the United Nations International Drug Control Programme  is clearly called for. In my opening words  I referred to a time of remarkable opportunities for the United Nations. Before concluding  I feel it is appropriate to return to those unique circumstances in the context of the tasks and challenges ahead. Now more than ever  the United Nations has the potential to become a more credible and effective world Organization for the benefit of all humankind. But the moment must be seized. There is a need to revamp the United Nations from within  to consolidate the Organization politically and concentrate on more effective management. This is necessary  not least in order for the Organization to regain and maintain the trust of its Member States. Furthermore  we must adapt the United Nations to the new demands posed by the growing number of Member States  the radical changes on the international scene and the growing interdependence of States since the Second World War. The Secretary General's recent report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" points the way. Let us be mindful of his observation that States Members of the United Nations are fortunate in having been given a second chance to create the world envisioned in the Charter  a chance denied with painful consequences the members of the League of Nations. "
"78",3435,"ISR",47,1992,"Let me begin by congratulating you  Sir  and the nation of Bulgaria  on your assumption of the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. May I also congratulate the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  on his leadership in the struggle for peace. I wish him success in his endeavours. Today I speak for an Israel that has chosen to step out of the shadows of the past to prepare for the invitation of a new future. The world is alive with the impulse for change. The end of conflict is no longer a Utopian fantasy. It is the dictate of realism and of universal self-interest. We look to the future in a world that wants peace. Like a hidden Samson  the forces of change have pushed aside the pillars of conventional wisdom  which proclaimed that military power is the source of national strength and prestige. This is no longer true. The cost of maintaining a significantly large army can deplete the resources of the richest countries  even if the weaponry remains unused. Around our changing world  the flow of knowledge has superseded military might as the source of real strength and social stability. The flow of knowledge no longer stops at national frontiers. It is not possible in the age of modern communications to shield peoples from truth and reality. Eventually  even dictators must face the fact that the best censors cannot block the free flow of ideas. But knowledge cannot be acquired without the right to doubt  the readiness to change. Knowledge is not available without freedom  and so democracy is prevailing throughout the world. In this new era  the era of knowledge  the governing principles are those of democratic structures  market-based economies  open borders  demilitarized international and regional relations  and respect for human rights. But while all nations should embrace these new principles  national traditions and identities retain their power. Nation-States will remain the focus of allegiance and social pride. To reconcile national identity  regional cooperation and universal solidarities is the central issue of contemporary life. The United Nations was established in an era that no longer exists. Yet its ideals and structures can meet the challenges and dangers of this new age. We support the ""Agenda for Peace"" offered by the Secretary-General. We support and will participate in the attempt to build a global protection system. The United Nations must be the headquarters for an all-embracing struggle to safeguard the environment against new threats. It must be a powerhouse to arrest starvation. It must develop the institutions and the ability to intervene when necessary to stop otherwise insoluble civil wars. The United Nations must reorganize to face these problems in a global capacity. In our own region  we must understand that even if our geography and people have not changed  the world has changed. No longer can we live on disappearing premises. For generations  the conflicts in the Middle East were nurtured by global conflicts by the cold war and hot competition. Within the context of super-Power rivalry  the belligerents in the Middle East were generously supplied with shining armour. But where there were once evil empires  we now see only the desire for a peaceful world. Russia has changed. The United States has emerged from the cold war with renewed respect from the world for its democratic drive for peace. The third world is changing  with many nations ending old hostilities and building new economies. In Africa  the forces of racism are being gradually driven out. In the Middle East itself let's face it the peace between Israel and Egypt is attaining the respect of age. There is a fresh atmosphere in our time. The time is now upon us for the nations of the Middle East to come to terms with the new realities  to make a living on their own. We can learn to benefit from peaceful coexistence. If we are to survive  we must understand that the dangers and opportunities we face are regional rather than national. In an age of long-range missiles  national defence must be a collective effort. To provide our people with modern standards of living we must have open borders and mutually beneficial exchanges. For too long the Middle East has been caught up in national conflicts and national rivalries for the glorification of national leaders. We need to build a new Middle East of  by and for the people. In our effort to build this new future for the Middle East  Israel does not ignore its still existing disagreements with our neighbours. The record shows that we are working to solve them humanely  honourably and  wherever possible  permanently. We are currently engaged in bilateral negotiations to bring an end to the conflicts of the past and multilateral negotiations to lay the foundation for the future. In the bilateral negotiations  we are negotiating with the Jordanians  the Palestinians  the Syrians and the Lebanese. The committed leadership of the United States has played a central role in bringing all the parties into face-to-face negotiations. With the Jordanians  the solutions are awaiting the parties. We face common problems we must confront together  including the possible Jordanian connection to Palestinian self-government and beyond. Our relations with the Hashemite Kingdom have seen open hostilities but also tacit efforts to overcome these hostilities. We look forward to a complete peace with the Kingdom of Jordan in the near future. With the Palestinian people  our conflict has been long and painful. We seek to end this conflict. We are looking for a bridge to cross the gulf of bitter memories  painful hatreds and emotion-laden suspicions. We have offered to negotiate an interim or transitional goal. There is no difference between the two. In fact  one can note with satisfaction that the Palestinians have agreed to this gradual approach. The direction is clear  even if the bridge will be built slowly. The suggested path is an interim self-government arrangement  as conceived at Camp David. We know that this proposal is imperfect in some respects. Self-government is less than independence. But it offers the flexibility of an arrangement that will last no more than five years. During this limited period of time  Palestinians in the territories will enjoy self-government. The opportunity to select  through democratic political elections  a Palestinian administrative council will enable the Palestinian people to exercise a double measure of freedom: the freedom to govern their own lives and to do so politically and democratically. But instead of attempting to draw a map of a self-governing territory and it is doubtful that this could be achieved now we have suggested a definite timetable. So  while this proposal lacks the clarity of a map  it provides the commitment of a calendar. This proposal is clearly a departure from the present situation. It has the dynamics of a voyage to a new destiny  a bridge which begins at one shore and reaches another. I know it will not be an easy choice for either side. But neither the existing situation nor the foreseeable future contains a more promising alternative. I am speaking for an Israeli Government that has firmly made up its mind and seeks the expeditious implementation of this proposal. In negotiations  the parties tend to scrutinize every letter  every dot. I hope that the Palestinians will also perceive the spirit of our intent  which is to extricate ourselves from the position of domination over another people. We have never in our history as a people sought domination over others. We wholeheartedly seek a future where the children of both peoples will escape the agonies of a distorted past and live under a clear sky of security and hope. With the Syrians  we have begun a dialogue in full daylight for the first time in 44 years. It is necessary now to translate the change in the mood between our two nations into viable and carefully constructed accords expressing a mutual interest in security and cooperation. We call for a departure from old dogmas and all-embracing dictates  and we hope the Syrians will adopt the same approach. We understand the need to safeguard the security and freedom of both nations  theirs and ours. It is our responsibility to ensure that those who have survived the wars of the past will have the opportunity to open a new peaceful chapter in the history of the two peoples. The leaders of both countries should be directly involved in these negotiations  which are in need of a new approach and creative thinking. I call on the President of Syria to set aside his reservations and meet with the Prime Minister of Israel. We have made clear to the Syrians that Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) contain a territorial dimension  combined with other components of peace and security which must be equally respected. We believe in a comprehensive solution involving all issues and all parties. Yet we do not consider it wise to link one negotiation to another  or to postpone an agreement with one country because of delays elsewhere. One negotiating process should not be handcuffed to another. With respect to Lebanon  Israel holds no territorial claims; nor does it seek to influence the political destiny of that country. We recall peaceful relations with Lebanon at a time when it was internally balanced and tranquil. We hope that such a time will return again. The moment Lebanon finds peace within itself and independence from outside intervention  Lebanon and Israel will live in peace again. Looking at the bilateral negotiations  we recall that the success of our negotiations with Egypt stemmed from dialogue at many levels of society: decision makers  leaders  businessmen  academicians. We appeal to all our Arab neighbours to establish the same dialogue today. There is no room for timidity  reluctance or boycotts in a peace process. Peacemaking should not be a hideaway operation. I hope our neighbours realize that Israel has implemented unilateral confidence-building measures. We have drastically changed our settlement policies  altered our policies towards the Palestinian people  offered new proposals for self-government and suggested target dates for the implementation of this process. We have done these things unconditionally. Yet confidence-building measures call for reciprocity. We seek an end to the unjustified economic boycott and the cessation of terror. We shall not allow ourselves or our adversaries to escape this chance for peace. Yet we cannot turn our region into a new Middle East by just negotiating old disputes. Our new challenges are on our horizons  not only in our frontiers. We say to our Arab neighbours: the real danger is not Israel. The real danger is poverty. The real danger is poverty that creates protest  even if it is occasionally cloaked in a religious mantle. Poverty and protest endanger both the Arab nations and Israel. Israel does not want to become an isolated island in an ocean of resentment. Two hundred forty million people live today in the Middle East. The majority of them live in a state of want. In 30 years  there will be 500 million people in the region  two thirds residing in Africa  one third in Asia.  The poverty of the Middle East has nothing to do with geography. It has to do with the use and misuse of available and potential resources in the region. The gap between wealthy and poor nations is wide: the more prosperous nations enjoy a per capita income 10 times greater than their poorer neighbours. The earth beneath us will continue to tremble if the wealthy remain oblivious to the needy  both within and beyond national borders. The multilateral negotiations are composed of five areas: economics  arms control  refugees  ecology and water. Progress in these areas will more likely be attained if we can restructure the multilateral talks  which initially created two advantages: the cluster of issues and the participation of many Arab countries. But the talks suffer as well from loose organization  which has resulted in seminars rather than negotiations  and from the lack of a concentrated thrust to coordinate their work. We suggest the following changes. First  the separate negotiations should be conducted in a coordinated manner. Secondly  participation in the steering committee should be raised to the ministerial level. Thirdly  the multilateral negotiations should be intensified through more frequent meetings for longer periods of time. Fourthly  the Syrians and the Lebanese should participate. Fifthly  discussion of human rights and pluralistic values should be made part of the talks so as to combine the discussion of well-defined practical issues with the pursuit of common values very much akin to the Helsinki accords. And finally  the parties should agree not to postpone progress in the multilateral talks until the conclusion of the bilateral negotiations. Early planning can save crucial time for all parties without forcing irreversible commitments. And lost time cannot be regained. The bilateral negotiations are essentially political. The multilateral negotiations are essentially economic. We live in an age when financial assistance in itself is no longer the answer to the economic needs of the Middle East. In the past  belligerency created dependence upon the financial assistance of other nations. By diminishing the need for arms and building the right economic structure  we will be able create wealth of our own. There is no need to impoverish the wealthy in order to enrich the poor. Opening borders  paving roads  introducing modern communications  and exchanging technology will generate economic growth in the Middle East. Trade across borders is essential for economic growth. Markets transcend national boundaries. Water  tourism and commerce do not subjugate themselves to political maps. The Middle East should follow the example of the ""seven tigers"" in Asia  the European Common Market and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Let us understand: these regions are our competitors and they are far ahead of the Middle East in facing the new realities of the international economy. We have to build an open regional economy  for the same reasons and with the same promise that led others to do so. We have to build a common market in the Middle East.  We have to set out upon the long and complicated road to arms control. That we can learn from the East-West negotiations and other attempts at arms control. We have to follow the patient path of confidence-building measures in the geographical and technical domains until we are able to rid the Middle East of the terror presented by weapons of mass destruction  both conventional and non-conventional. Israel has proposed the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East numerous times  and we stand ready to pursue this goal today. We should address the problems of refugees  not by threatening to destroy the existing demographic balance  but by exploring a range of possibilities for restoring the dignity of refugees and offering them a new life. We should act to save our fresh air and historic landscape. Ecological pollution does not respect borders  and so we have to marshal forces to save our region from the danger of uncontrolled deterioration. Finally  the Middle East possesses vast desert land but meagre water resources. The land is static  the population is increasing and water resources are declining. Available water should be reused  and new fresh water produced from the sea. Either the land will be salinized by the sea or the sea water will be desalinized through available technology. The technology is available  and the necessary credit is attainable. We can satisfy the needs of man and land. The Middle East can be made green. It depends upon us. Here  I believe  are the pillars of wisdom for a new Middle East: economic growth  arms control  dignity for the refugees  environmental protection and water resources  coupled with religious freedom  pluralistic values and human rights. The nations of the Middle East must work individually and collectively to meet these challenges of a changed world. The agenda is ambitious. Is it merely a dream? No. It is a blueprint  and the necessary elements are within our grasp. Will these goals be achieved in our lifetime? We dare not hesitate  because the world will not wait for the Middle East. We are tragically late in making peace. If we do not face our economic challenges  we will be left hopelessly far behind. The agenda is new. The vision was already mentioned in Proverbs: ""Wisdom builds the house. ""Good judgment makes it secure."" (The Holy Bible. Proverbs 24:3) ""Wisdom prevails over strength; knowledge over brute force."" (The Holy Bible. Proverbs 24:5) We have to go to work. For us  the Jewish people  this is Rosh Hashanah  the New Year. We pray that the year to come will bring peace  freedom and prosperity to build a new Middle East for all of its people Muslim  Christian  Jewish  Arab  Israeli for us  and for our children. "
"79",3482,"ITA",47,1992,"First of all  I have great pleasure in congratulating you. Sir  and your country  Bulgaria  on your election as President of the General Assembly. I should also like to express Italy's satisfaction  and my own  at seeing here present the delegations of the new States admitted to our Organization during the past year: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Moldova  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. May I be permitted to extend a particularly warm welcome to the delegation of San Marino  a State with which Italy has close ties of very long standing. I should particularly like to express my Government's most sincere appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who is giving the United Nations the benefit of his wealth of experience in political affairs and diplomacy. Even in his first year he has already worked tirelessly and constructively to apply the principles which we all support and which are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The points I am about to make follow on the comments  which Italy fully endorses  made by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom  the current President of the European Community. Since the historic events of 1989  no General Assembly session has been held  or will be held in the near future  against the same international background as the session of the previous year. Since the demise of bipolarism  international society has become subject to processes of reaggregation which are made more laborious and arduous by an array of historical  cultural  ethnic  religious and nationalistic factors. There are certain groups that  wishing to assert their own specificity  are not content to be recognized and safeguarded within the State framework to which they belong  but seek to express their own identity in the form of statehood. In the East  what was once a monolithic structure has been falling apart  and  in some cases  is being fragmented into a multiplicity of separate entities  each demanding to translate its own history  culture and national identity into an international personality. In the process  they are resorting to all available means  including conflict and violence. The obstacles preventing the restoration of equilibrium are not really new: they derive from factors that have long been chafing under the heavy yoke of dictatorship. Constrained in ideological straitjackets  they have been unable to engage in an open dialectic. Denied all opportunities for natural development  they have maintained the potential for confrontation and conflict. With the fall of ideologies and the break-up of the Soviet empire  the nightmare of a nuclear holocaust has receded. But while the spectre of a world war has been banished  we are still seeing a proliferation of local wars. These and the manifold antagonisms underlying them now pose a new threat  particularly in geographical areas that have regained their freedom but find it marred by violence and conflict and are unable to build a new structure based on tolerance and peace. There are therefore hotbeds of war  signs of revolt and unresolved conflicts in areas formerly belonging to the Soviet empire  which is now divided into a number of republics united only by tenuous economic relations and very fragile political ties. In Central Europe  ancient nations which have graduated from limited to full sovereignty are endeavouring to become pluralistic democracies with a market economy.. They  too  are having their share of problems. And how can we forget the war raging in the very heart of Europe the most complex  dangerous and tragic of all these conflicts and the one thus far untouched by all international appeals? In the territory of the former Yugoslavia  and particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina  bloodshed and strife are accompanied by violations of the dignity of the human person. After the horrors of the Second World War  we had all hoped never again to witness acts of discrimination and violence against those belonging to a different ethnic group. What gives.us cause for pessimism is the fact that after the London Conference a new and original experiment  which brought together round the conference table the United Nations  represented by its Secretary-General  the 12 members of the European Community  the members of the United Nations Security Council  and representatives of Serbia and Montenegro  Croatia  Slovenia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Macedonia  and after clear commitments were entered into and undertakings were even signed on such matters as cessation of the violence  control over heavy weapons  the cessation of ""ethnic cleansing"" and the closure of concentration camps  nothing I say nothing - has been done apart from some occasional checks on heavy weapons. In spite of the assurances and undertakings given by Prime Minister Panic  which we consider sincere and deserving of support  shooting continues in the towns and in the mountains  and planes are being shot down  as in the case of an Italian aircraft carrying relief supplies. Four airmen died in that incident  and three French soldiers belonging to the United Nations Protection Force have been killed. Many other lives have been lost. A miserable winter lies ahead and people will suffer from hunger  cold and disease. It is now too dangerous to provide humanitarian assistance  and the threatened sanctions are not entirely watertight. Can the international community and its institutions permit this ongoing tragedy to persist in spite of the solemn promises and pledges made at high-level peace conferences? Can the perpetrators of heinous and odious crimes be allowed to escape international judgement  also at the legal level? This question must be answered by those whose duty it is to do so  including myself  in the appropriate forums.  However  going beyond politics  I should like to reiterate an appeal voiced by one of the greatest writers of this century: ""What we need today is a 'militant' humanism imbued with the conviction that the principles of liberty  tolerance and doubt must not be exploited or defeated by a fanaticism that knows no doubts. If European humanism has lost its robust capacity to review its ideas it will end in ruin  and we will have a Europe whose name is no more than a geographical term."" In the third world  too  the end of bipolarism has eliminated for many States the need to ""belong"" and to heed the dictates of a particular bloc  even in a non-aligned context. Crises exist also in this area  as in the case of Somalia  Iraq and Mozambique  although we hope to see this latter crisis resolved  also as a result of Italy's mediation efforts. At this point we should ask ourselves a question: Now that the gulf between East and West has been bridged  are we not about to face a rift between North and South? We must counter this danger and reactivate the dialogue in all possible forums and translate the concept of assistance into a living reality. We should also oppose methods and procedures that use development cooperation to help the economic agents of donor countries; work on the basis of established programmes; ensure that assistance is not wrongfully diverted both in the countries of origin and in those of destination; and reorganize and coordinate the various sources of financing. Italy realizes that it has not yet reached  owing to its financial imbalances  the generous development assistance targets it had set for itself. A reorganization of the country's financial structures will also facilitate a renewed effort to fulfil this pledge. Now that the Rio Conference has been held  international cooperation will have to reconcile the needs of development with the equally pressing need to protect the environment. Italy  which supports the establishment of the United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development  undertakes to implement the Rio recommendations in an effort involving governments as well as non-governmental organizations. Chile's proposal for a world social conference  which Italy warmly supports  opens up yet another important field of endeavour for the United Nations. In surveying this new international scene  we have no reason to lament or regret the passing of the bipolar structure of the world. We cannot forget that we paid for the containment of a global threat with a peace guaranteed by the menace of nuclear war  by the denial of freedom to millions of human beings  by violations of the fundamental rights of man and by the inaction of a society that destroyed resources  stunted the growth of its own leadership and is now posing the same old problems in a more acute form. The ideological confrontation has ended with the downfall of the largest ideological system in our history  the communist system  but now that this ideology has collapsed  problems have remained in individual nations and in the world as a whole. The names of these problems are hunger  disease  environmental degradation and political instability. It would indeed be an irreversible defeat for mankind were the world of affluence  production and consumption of our generation to confuse the downfall of ideologies with the collapse of all values and if it were to forget that in every national society  and particularly in relations between the industrialized world and the developing countries  the two concepts of solidarity and interdependence need to be translated into political action. An example of this need is provided by the problem of Somalia. This country tragically illustrates the total detachment and lack of concern shown by the affluent societies towards countries plagued by poverty and disease  but the fate of this country also exemplifies the harm caused to people by prolonged power struggles that are never resolved. The country is divided in half. The capital  Mogadishu  is also divided  and like other population centres lacks essential services. The people are suffering from malnutrition and their health is in jeopardy. Armed youths  some no older than 14  are defending the territory by violent means. They do not attend school because they are unable to do so. We must gratefully acknowledge the initiative taken by the United Nations and its Secretary-General in sending a Special Representative  Ambassador Sahnoun  who is doing outstanding work in the field of humanitarian assistance and in the service of peace. I myself paid a two-day visit to the capital and parts of the interior. I found assistance facilities deplorable  and I spoke individually with the persons who have the power to make war or peace in an effort to promote peace initiatives. Anyone  regardless of region or religious affiliation  who is able to assist in the peace process must do so  because Somalia needs guidance  partners and  in short  a government. We must therefore give urgent attention to the need for an international initiative involving organizations and countries able to contribute to the pacification and reconstruction of Somalia  with the active participation of the United Nations. At this point  I should like to emphasize one of the most delicate and problematical  but also most promising points of contact between North and South  namely  the Mediterranean. Italy is currently following  in a spirit of optimism and active support  the promising developments in the peace process designed to end the Arab-Israeli conflict and provide a solution to the Palestinian question. Italy is aware that this hoped-for solution should also lead to the removal of a burden that has jeopardized the prospects for promoting a climate of peace and collaboration in the Mediterranean. Our expectations  which  we believe  are shared by the entire international community  thus extend beyond the vital objective of achieving mutual acceptance between all the peoples of the Middle East and look forward to a future characterized by sincere commitment to the process of dialogue and cooperation in the economic as well as in other fields in order to build peace. In trying today to identify possible means of reconstituting the international order  we find that regional groupings can play a unifying role  whether they follow the path of integration or confine themselves to close cooperation in the economic field  in foreign policy or in security matters.* In Western Europe  we have built and tested structures that have brought about a phenomenon quite different from the situation now prevailing in the troubled Eastern part of the continent. The need to defend democracy  the vast scope of economic development  spurred by technological progress  and the necessity of preserving the values of European culture and history  so that Europe can again play a major role in international society have led us to attach less importance to the theory and practice that nations must necessarily take the form of States. They phenomena have shown us that large areas of State sovereignty can be administered jointly in a supranational context and that such a link can also make war impossible. The process is certainly not an easy one  because it must be achieved through consensus and because obstacles  as we have seen in the last few days  crop up at every turn. European integration has repeatedly proved capable of overcoming the difficulties it has encountered. It is a mistake to speak  as some have done recently  of delays or setbacks in the process of further integration established at Maastricht. At their meeting held here in New York  the Foreign Ministers of the Community took note of the positive outcome of the French referendum and reaffirmed their determination to ratify the Treaty within the time stipulated without renegotiating it. The phenomenon of European integration can be seen as an attractive example and also as a factor for re-aggregation and stability in Central and Eastern Europe. In this context  the Commonwealth of Independent States could be a stabilizing element in so far as it can offer its former components valid prospects for association. A significant link between various components of the European continent is provided by the Central European Initiative  which Italy continues to support. In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  nations both large and small have gained the conviction that war can never again be a means of solving problems between them. That alliance has now formed an association in the framework of the North Atlantic Council with countries that were formerly its adversaries. Since Helsinki II  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) has been setting up institutional machinery to assist it in better performing its tasks. Examples of integration are to be found not only in Europe but on every continent  and they encompass a variety of forms  ranging from the more tried and tested institutions  such as the Andean Pact and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  to more recent initiatives  such as the common market of four South American countries (MERCOSUR)  or completely new developments  such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Also very important are the new forms of cooperation in certain specific and highly sensitive areas  such as the nuclear sector. The recent agreement between Argentina and Brazil would appear to be very promising. The formation of regional associations is a course worth pursuing and an effective means of strengthening international society. The United Nations might find this a useful means of consolidating the peace. The problems in whose solution the United Nations will increasingly be involved deal not only with relations between States but also with their internal structure and their components in terms of minorities and ethnic groups. Italy does not have an answer  but it does have concrete experience to contribute to the international community: the solution to the Alto Adige problem. That dispute between Italy and Austria  which was brought before the United Nations in the period 1960-1961  was officially brought to a conclusion last June. That conclusion came as a result of a lengthy process involving the elaboration and application at the national level of a package of measures adopted by Italy in consultation with the representatives of the German-speaking population of Alto Adige. Those measures cover all aspects of civilian life and provide one of the most progressive examples of minority protection in Europe. We feel that the settlement of that issue proves that autonomy  when adequately guaranteed by domestic legal provisions  serves to strengthen rather than weaken harmony in a national setting  while also promoting good-neighbourly relations and international cooperation across borders. There is no doubt that in the changed conditions in which we are living the United Nations will have greater responsibility and will therefore need greater authority and more effective means of performing its mission; hence the discussions concerning a ""new United Nations""  that is  an Organization capable of moving in new directions to satisfy the widely felt need for some kind of world order or government. It is the members of the Assembly that  in conformity with the Charter and in fulfilment of the obligations deriving from it  must assume the status and responsibility not only of peace-loving countries  but also of States that renounce the use of force as a means of settling international disputes and consider the protection of human rights to be an inescapable duty. We welcome the appearance of a new and compelling document which should serve as a basis for discussion in the Organization. I am referring once again to ""An Agenda for Peace""  the Secretary-General's report on preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. Preventive diplomacy should be a means of defusing potential conflicts before they reach the critical threshold of a confrontation. This preventive approach calls also for prompt steps to guarantee through mechanisms contemplated in General Assembly resolution 46/36 L the transparency of international arms transfers and of their production. The same applies to the convention banning chemical weapons  which has finally been submitted to the Assembly for approval and which will institute a global monitoring system with unprecedented powers of on-site verification. Peace-keeping must now be approached and applied today in innovative ways so as to make more effective the linkage between action to prevent a sharpening of armed conflict and the search for negotiated solutions. It is also worth giving in-depth consideration to the possibility of using ""peace-enforcement"" units  not just to perform the tasks of traditional peace-keeping forces  in other words to intervene where a cease-fire exists  but in order to restore and maintain it. Lastly  a new need arises from the existing conflicts  the need to supplement peace-keeping and peacemaking instruments by providing adequate military protection for humanitarian assistance efforts. In order to cope with all these requirements we will need adequate structures and resources. Also  Italy along the lines here illustrated by the French Foreign Minister is prepared to give its own concrete contribution  as it has proved with its recent offer of men and equipment formulated in the framework of the Yugoslav crisis. The situation of former Yugoslavia also highlights the importance of the regional dimension in pursuing ""An Agenda for Peace"". It now seems that the option of a regional solution for regional conflicts as provided in the Charter could be effectively applied in a variety of ways in a kind of variable geometry of peace. An important example is the format of the London Conference  which I have already mentioned. Here the regional dimension is not an alternative to United Nations involvement; it also operates on the basis of a creative formula for the sharing of responsibilities. The United Nations system in any case seems destined increasingly to rely in practice on regional organizations - ranging from the Organization of American States (OAS) to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and communities  alliances or unions of States  as is the case for the European Community  the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the Yugoslav situation. Important new developments compel us also to rethink the limitations on the application of certain traditional concepts and principles underlying international relations. To rethink certainly does not mean to reject. It means avoiding all rigid and absolute definitions and interpreting principles in such a way as to preclude unbalanced applications that are bound to be in conflict. We may note  for example  that at the urging of a collective conscience that now knows no boundaries the principle of non-interference in the domestic affairs of States is being increasingly reviewed in the light of the grave dangers threatening the survival of entire population groups. It is also clear that if every ethnic  religious or language group were to claim its own State there would be endless fragmentation and  consequently  instability. From the discussions held during the first few days of the session it is becoming increasingly clear that all Members of the Organization agree in their evaluation of the central role regained by the United Nations. We all seem to realize that this strengthening of the United Nations will require not only the assignment of new roles but also the provision of adequate powers and resources. The alternative would be the anti-historical reconstitution of an oligarchy made up of those countries having the greatest capacity for unilaterally assuming the role of guarantors of international legality. We must protect the United Nations new capacity for action with greater vigilance and a keen sense of responsibility without becoming entrenched in positions that would preclude future institutional development. Italy  along other countries  has already stated that the question of revising certain parts of the Charter relating to matters such as the composition of the Security Council must be adequately debated. We still believe that the Council could be made more authoritative and representative by increasing the number of temporary and permanent members  choosing the latter on the basis of objective criteria. Italy will also assert its aspiration for a more adequate representation in the Security Council at that moment  unless institutional developments in the European Union will not allow at a certain stage the institution of a European seat in the Security Council. I should like to conclude by observing that the United Nations has the main responsibility for handling the difficult yet exciting international developments we are now witnessing. It will do so with tools of crisis management that are suitable to the world of today  a world in which it is becoming increasingly necessary to accept limitations in the area of national sovereignty  guaranteed by the objectivity of a supranational collective system  by using political instruments and procedures wherever possible  or by applying coercive measures if they are needed.  What needs to be preserved are the aims of the Charter  which continue to be not only valid but indeed essential. But in a world that is now quite different from the world of 1945  the transformation of which began to accelerate in 1989  it would be unthinkable to suggest that we should avoid taking speedy and courageous action to devise new instruments  change our thinking and review the powers and composition of United Nations organs. Only by maintaining a fruitful polarity between permanent goals and new instruments  to which we must all contribute  will we be able to meet the challenges of our times. "
"80",3528,"JAM",47,1992,"	On	behalf of my Government and the peopleof Jamaica  I take this opportunity to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. I am confident that your vision and energy will guide this session to a successful conclusion.I must also take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has assumed the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations at a most challenging period for this Organization and a turning point in the history of world affairs.He are all gathered here today to present our varying viewpoints about the many issues which are of concern to us as individual nations and as a world body. That in itself gives all of us a sense of hope that our problems  which loom so large on the world horizon  are not insoluble if we all determine to use this forum as a vehicle for working together to solve them.In the past the admission of new Member States has been largely the result of the decolonization processes in Asia  the Pacific  Africa and the Caribbean. The current phenomenon of new States from Europe signals the fundamental realignment of political boundaries on that continent. I wish formally  on behalf of the Government and people of Jamaica  to welcome warmly the 13 new Members to the family of the United Nations. We meet in the aftermath of fundamental changes in the political landscape which have profound implications for each of us as individual nations. They also impact on the world community collectively and therefore on the agenda and future activities of this Organization. The end of the cold war heralds a new era in which the United Nations is expected to take decisive action based on the merits of each issue  rather than in response to fixed ideological positions buttressed by the use of veto power.The world economy is experiencing revolutionary alteration. No country  developed or developing  is immune. In all of this  the fundamental and unchanging reality is the widening gap between the relatively few rich industrialized countries of the North and the many poor developing ones in the South.In so many ways so much has changed  and yet so much remains the same.It was 12 years ago  in 1980  that as Foreign Minister of my country I last addressed the Assembly. It was a time of great optimism. There was ongoing dialog between North and South. He seemed to share a common understanding of the requirements for international cooperation and development. Barely had the decade of the 1980s begun than the dialog abruptly ended. The international economic environment became even more unfavorable. The developing countries of the South were left to grapple with enormous external debt. Most of us spent the decade undertaking major structural reform.The painful adjustment has weighed heavily on the poor and the vulnerable. Only now are we beginning to see prospects for growth and development as a result of these reforms. It is important that a favorable international economic environment be established so as to complete the process. It is imperative that the United Nations  this universalOrganization  play a central role in enabling mankind to meet the challenges and grasp the present opportunities.All Member States  be they large or small  have the right to articulate their views and express their aspirations. Me have an equal obligation to contribute to finding a common solution. Today I address my remarks from the perspective of my own country  which exemplifies in many respects the goals and concerns of the developing world.When Jamaica joined the United Nations in 1962 we recognized that to make a better life for our people we were required to consolidate our democracy  respect human rights  ensure the rule of law and promote racial  religious  and cultural tolerance. Ours is a society which reflects a varied mosaic ""Out of many  one people"" is our motto. Ideally  this mirrors the central purpose of the United Nations ""Out of many nations  one world"".To achieve sustainable development and fulfill the promise of a better life for our people  we must create the conditions for economic growth and development for all our countries. To achieve this  we must reduce the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks. I call upon the General Assembly to issue a summons to all Member States for a new agenda which provides the basic conditions for human survival everywhere.Over the past 45 years the peacemaking function of this Organization has been circumscribed by the dictates of the cold war. The threat of a nuclear holocaust was averted not so much by reason but by the certainty of mutually assured destruction. The United Nations was relegated to the role of spectator  fearful of the consequences  but powerless to act. Peace and security in many regions was breached. This often reflected the surrogate conflicts between the super-Powers  exploiting the reality of economic disparities and nationalist or ethnic animosities.The United Nations can no longer remain impotent to prevent conflict/ to make peace/ to build peace and to keep the peace. The Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace"" contains many innovative proposals in these areas. They provide a constructive basis on which Member States may formulate effective responses to conflicts  actual or potential  around the world. Jamaica will contribute to the search for a full consensus on the effective role for the United Nations and its organs in the new scenario. The interface between the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council and the International Court of Justice can best provide the requisite framework for legitimacy  authority and the operational context of international law.We note the hopeful signs that are emerging in South Africa  the Middle East  Cambodia and the Korean peninsula. The current round of direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors is an encouraging development which Jamaica fully supports. But there is still a long way to go in achieving the goals of peace and security. The world community cannot afford to relax either its vigilance or its commitment to a just and lasting resolution of these problems.We began 1992 with hope that the progress towards ending apartheid in South Africa would gain momentum. The referendum in March formally sanctioned the reform process. Hope has turned to despair as violence has continued to pose a serious threat to that process. The blood of South Africans continues to be shed in the long struggle to end the abhorrent system of apartheid. The incidents that have taken place since July in Boipatong and the Ciskei homeland have nearly torpedoed the prospects for peace and the process of negotiating towards democratic rule in South Africa.The Government and people of Jamaica have long supported the anti-apartheid struggle in that country. He were heartened by the appearance of progress. He would not wish to see the process derailed.The international community must signal its clear and unswerving determination to see concrete results that end the cycle of violence and ensure the success of negotiations aimed at achieving a democratic and non-racist society. Jamaica will not be satisfied until there is the reality of one-person  one-vote.There are other areas in urgent need of effective United Nations initiatives. In Central and Eastern Europe  in the Persian Gulf  in South Africa  in Somalia  in Haiti  the problem varies in magnitude and in complexity. There is a real chance that the United Nations can make a significant contribution. It cannot do so without the resources and full support of the rich and powerful nations.In my own region  in the Caribbean country of Haiti  a repressive and illegal regime continues to hold power a year after overthrowing the democratically elected leader of that country. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide remains a virtual exile. Measures taken by the Organization of American States (OAS) to resolve the situation have not yet achieved the hoped for results. In particular  the embargo is being flouted by some European countries and even by some member countries of the OAS itself.He owe it to the people of Haiti and to ourselves to continue support for their cause for a restoration of constitutional rule. All those who espouse freedom must remain resolute in the conviction that the democratic flame which flickered briefly should remain for ever alight in that country.The machinery of the United Nations  in concert with the OAS  must render positive assistance to the Haitian people. We urge the General Assembly to lend its weight in support of the legitimate Government and people of one of its Member States.The Secretary-General has correctly highlighted the importance of the concept of the rule of law in international  no less than in national  affairs. The International Court of Justice should be strengthened and its jurisdiction must be extended to command universal acceptance. Its judgments must have binding force and effect.We would also urge the major industrial countries to give concrete expression to their commitment to international law by ratifying the Convention on the Law of the Sea without delay. The informal consultations initiated by the previous Secretary- General  and still continuing  have resulted in significant progress. The work must now revert to the Preparatory Commission  which has the competence and authority to make the necessary decisions.Let us now review the world economic scene and the new agenda on which the Organization must immediately embark.The link between peace  security and economic well-being is recognized by our Charter. It mandates the United Nations to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples through international action.The break-up of the integrated trading system of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe  coupled with the rapid movement to dismantle their centralized economic system and substitute one that is market-oriented  has undoubtedly  in its immediate aftermath  posed severe challenges to the peoples of those countries.The Governments of the Western industrialized countries were quick to recognize the threat to peace and security  if these unstable and chaotic conditions were not effectively and immediately addressed. They have moved with commendable speed to identify and provide the assistance required.Regrettably  the same urgency and attention has never been forthcoming in respect of what has been a problem of longer standing  that is far more fundamental and potentially catastrophic. I speak of the ever-widening gap between the affluent countries of the North and the poverty rampant in most countries of the South.The decade of the 1980s brought sustained economic growth and increasing affluence to the industrialized countries and rapid development to the newly industrialized countries of South-East Asia. For the rest of the developing world in Latin America and the Caribbean  in Africa and in the rest of Asia - this has  with few exceptions  been a period of relative  and often actual  decline in economic growth and living standards  exacerbated by rapid population increases.The last decade witnessed a severe fall in commodity prices  the reduction of private- and public-sector flows  and a mounting debt burden which have resulted in outflows to the international financial institutions and to the developed world. Those trends must be halted and reversed*In the search for lasting peace we must prevent increasing poverty for a substantial portion of the human race. The affluent also have a vital interest in the reduction of human misery. This is no time for recrimination as to who created this fundamental problem. He must all be part of finding an urgent solution to avoid political instability and social unrest.Most of our countries have embarked with determination on the difficult task of economic restructuring. We have been reducing government budgets  opening our economies  emphasizing the pre-eminent role of the private sector and creating conditions for competitive market-driven economies. Undoubtedly  these are necessary prescriptions.There is  however  no denying that in the short run  they have imposed considerable hardships on all sectors of our population  particularly the poorest our women and our children. In this critical situation  a supportive international economic environment is an urgent necessity to mitigate the short-term effects.There is need for a greatly increased flow of public and private financial resources into the countries of the South. We must devise machinery to facilitate the transfer of relevant technology. We must create a climate of international trade which rejects protectionism and stimulates export-led growth.Of increasing importance in the world economy is the trend towards regional economic integration movements and the consolidation of trading blocs among the countries of Europe and Worth America.For the developing countries  the trend towards regional integration of economic structures is an essential step in the process of our own development. To the extent that this expands our home market base and promotes the cooperative sharing of financial and technical resources  it will strengthen our economies  increase our purchasing and productive power and contribute positively to the growth of world trade. From this exercise wewill all benefit.The developed countries already control the major share of world trade  financial resources and technology. If the trading blocs of Europe and North America create defensive mechanisms against each other and establish barriers impenetrable by the rest of the world economy  the result is likely to be a growing marginalization of the developing countries and a concomitant widening of the gap between North and South.Such a process will lead to stagnation and an eventual shrinkage of world trade. An increasing world population alongside the prospect of more impoverished countries is a recipe for explosion.A fair trading system is required to encourage the development of regional integration processes among developing countries to recognize their need for temporary preferential and protective measures in specific areas and promote the maximum openness in the economies of the developed countries.This path is essential to a more equitable  prosperous and peaceful world.The iron curtain between East and West has finally been dismantled. It is now high time to bridge the gulf that perpetuates the great divide between the North and the South. This Organization the United Nations - must provide the forum for meaningful dialog and chart the course for practical  effective action.The abatement of cold war tensions  the outbreak of ethnic conflicts  the reality of global interdependence  dictate that the world community must seize this opportune moment to give concentrated focus on a secure peace that rests on the foundations of meaningful development and sustained economic growth for all.He must approach this dialog in sober recognition of the fact that no part of the world can long remain immune to events in any other part. Famine disease/ ecological degradation/ the desperate migration of people in search of survival  the inhumanity of poverty  cannot indefinitely be ignored by any creature on planet Earth.Meaningful development must have a social dimension and must be sustainable. In respect of the former  we welcome the proposal for the convening of a world summit on the theme of social development.The Earth Summit  recently concluded in Brazil  served to underscore the inter-linkages between security  disarmament  debt  trade  technology  the environment and development. Heads of State and Government were obliged to accept the interrelationships of these perennial concerns. We were forced to admit that these issues could not be treated in splendid isolation  but required concerted action. This very admission suggests that the time is propitious for a new beginning.The spirit of Rio must not be lost. Time will tell whether the political will exists for us to cooperate with each other against the common threat to the environment we all share. Mere lip service will not suffice.I expect this session of the General Assembly to settle the institutional machinery that ensures decisive action in the period following the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. It will need to address the concerns of small island States and the enhancement of scientific and technological capacity among developing countries.Jamaica supports the decision to form a high-level commission for sustainable development. We intend to assist the commission fully once the important details of its program of work have been agreed.I expect the Assembly also to confront the question of financial resources in order to implement Agenda 21. An initial commitment of at least $600 billion annually is required so that the work we have painstakingly accepted can be adequately implemented.The key donor countries and agencies will need to look at several proposals within the Global Environmental Facility  the International Development Association  regional development banks  private-sector funding and financial transfers from Governments  to see how best a realistic international economic effort can be organized. But we must all resist the tendency to use resources for environmental protection and management as but one more device to bring developing countries under the dictates of the multilateral financial institutions.The development that we seek in the present and the coming century is impossible without managing our environment efficiently. The case for acting in concert is overwhelming. The time for action is now.Our agenda of political  economic and environmental changes  which all our citizens demand  no longer permits the United Nations to remain a passive spectator. It must play a catalytic role and assume operational leadership.This makes it imperative that we re-order our priorities. This can be accomplished only in the context of institutional restructuring. The Secretary-General has already demonstrated his own commitment to this process. His proposals have been supplemented by proposals from many other sources. All of this provides a framework and a point of departure for our discussions and decisions in the months ahead  here in the General Assembly and in other organs of the United Nations.The debate must be informed by the principles enshrined in the Charter. The decisions we make must ensure that the vision is realized and our purposes are met. This Organization must always act in a transparent manner so that it is never subverted by the introduction of hegemonism from any quarter. Any new world order must be based on the rule of law. In creating or shaping it  we need to be inclusive  not exclusive. All nations and peoples must be encouraged to satisfy their legitimate aspirations and fulfill their dreams.While the new spirit of cooperation in the Security Council is a most welcome development  that body must reflect all interests in its determinations. Maintaining the confidence of the General Assembly requires its acceptance of accountability to this body. The role and function of the General Assembly must be enhanced. There must be non-selectivity in the taking of decisions and the consequent action to enforce them.Definitions of human rights are not susceptible to differing interpretations imposed by any one State or group of States. The relevant international covenants on economic  social  cultural  political and civil rights must be universal standards. Once this is accepted we can deal effectively and even-handedly with all violations of human rights wherever they may occur. Resolute international action  based on the Charter and other rules of international law  must be applied.Once more  this Organization is presented with a real opportunity to fulfill its noble purposes and to be an effective instrument in creating a world order of lasting peace  economic prosperity and social justice. Its success depends on the commitment and practical support that we  the sovereign nations that constitute its membership  bring to those purposes.There is a clarion call proclaiming that a new dawn is at hand. If we succeed  the fruits are glorious.The fact is  everything is at stake; we are all at risk  and so we darenot fail."
"81",3574,"JOR",47,1992,"It gives me great pleasure to extend to you  on behalf of my country. Sir  warm congratulations on your election to the post of President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You represent a friendly nation with which my country has ties of friendship and cooperation. Your wealth of experience and competence will help bring our work to a successful conclusion and achieve the desired results. It also gives me great pleasure to extend our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  who  with his abundant skill  experience and patience  was able to conduct the business of our past session with particular success. May I also have the pleasure  at the beginning of my statement  to express my sincere thanks and deep gratitude to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General  for his unremitting efforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and its Secretariat and make it more effective in the service of international peace and security  as well as in facing up to the challenges and addressing the issues that have arisen with the end of the cold-war era. I would also like to commend his well thought-out and comprehensive report on the work of the Organization which indicates the new and auspicious direction of the United Nations under his guidance. The forty-seventh session is convened at a time when several new States have been admitted to membership of the United Nations  thereby enhancing the universality of this Organization. I welcome all of them and look forward to their contribution in the pursuit of the objectives and principles of the United Nations Charter. Given its awareness of the interdependent character of the world we live in and its belief in dialogue  diplomacy and negotiations as the ideal and  indeed  the only means of resolving international disputes  my country looks forward to cooperation with all Members of the United Nations with a view to moving human society to yet higher levels of progress  stability and growth. Over the past few years  the world has undergone many historic and unprecedented changes which have tended to encourage democratization and the promotion of freedoms  the rule of law  respect for human rights and the pursuit of progress and development. While the end of the ideological confrontation between East and West has brought about a new state of international harmony at a certain level  yet it seems that the conflict was a lid that covered a great deal of smouldering embers under the ashes. The confrontation had hardly ended when certain primitive tendencies reared their heads. Some of those tendencies are tribal  some are ethnic and others are religious. None of them augurs well for a very rosy future for many regions of the world. This is a situation that calls for collective action under the auspices of this Organization to rationalize the transition  and thereby  to contain those tensions  in their various forms  within acceptable humanitarian contexts. Our world is now going through a phase of transition from one era to another  where the changes are taking place at an astonishingly rapid pace that has left behind many cultural  social and political principles that many groups in human society continue to hang on to as if they were eternal. This makes it imperative that we act to create a mechanism to facilitate and manage the transition  which is  perhaps  the most difficult period in the lives of communities as well as in the lives of the individuals. There is enough wisdom in this world and in the Secretariat of this Organization in particular  to make us in Jordan look forward to a better future. Jordan does not accept the argument that modern technology  which has compressed the world into a global village  has led to the opposite of what was expected of it. We do not subscribe to the view of those who maintain that it has led to ideological ossification and has bred an attitude of indifference to the pains  hopes and aspirations of others. Proceeding from this  Jordan  a State that may be small in size but big in leadership  wishes to share with you a futuristic vision of a world that now stands at the threshold of the twenty-first century. We feel that we may be justified in this by the fact that we are a State that  since its inception  has committed itself to the straight path of justice and pursued a policy that eschewed violence and extremism. It has always maintained a rational  moderate  middle-of-the-road approach in dealing with both its domestic and its foreign affairs. Hence  Jordan has in effect become an oasis of stability in a turbulent region where emotionalism  extremism and ideological as well as physical violence are still rampant. Perhaps the most significant outcome of this policy has been the establishment in my country of a solid democratic system based on political pluralism. Jordan  which believes in collective action and in the United Nations principles  as well as in a world of peace  security and stability  takes pride in the confidence placed in it in being called upon to contribute troops to the peace-keeping forces in a number of areas of tension in the world: in  Croatia and Cambodia  in addition to observers in Angola and Somalia. My country thus believes in the need to support the United Nations to enable it to carry out effectively the essential functions set forth in the Charter  namely  the promotion of peace and security all over the world and the provision of the means for the welfare and progress of its peoples. We stress that the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Secretariat under the leadership of the new Secretary-General  who is well known for his patience  vision and extensive knowledge  together with the political will of Member States and the yearning of peoples for a better world  should combine to form the basis for effective measures in the field of preventive diplomacy for peacemaking and peace-keeping and the process of post-war peace building. The ""Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  prepared by the Secretary-General  is indeed a very valuable contribution because of the in-depth and comprehensive analysis it offers and the set of scenarios and assumptions envisioned for United Nations work with a view to enhancing its efficiency and revitalizing its various agencies and organizations with a view to forging a new world of peace and prosperity. Allow me  in dealing with the most important international issues  to address the dispute in the Middle East region and its core issue  the Palestine question. My country  Jordan  has indeed lived the tragedy of the Palestinian people from the beginning and  with its limited resources  has borne the brunt of its economic  social and political repercussions. We have noticed recently that this problem has had its share of the effects of the many political changes and international breakthroughs that have been brought about by the end of the cold war era  in that the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine question have taken a positive turn in line with those changes. This started with the Madrid Peace Conference. Jordan has joined in this peace process because of its firm commitment to the achievement of a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the region  and because of its belief in the justice of the Palestinian cause and in the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including their right to establish their own independent State on their native soil  as well as in the right of every State in the region to live in peace and security within recognized boundaries. Those premises and objectives of the peace process are based on international resolutions  most importantly Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  which affirm the land-for-peace equation of returning the occupied territories  including Jordanian territory and the Syrian Golan  in exchange for peace  and which also affirm the necessity of Israeli withdrawal from Arab Al-Quds. We in Jordan believe that peace is an objective that our generation ought to pursue. We also believe that in order for peace to be real and lasting  it must be based on international legality and must be just  comprehensive and  thereby  acceptable to future generations. The peace we believe in is peace that would be an incentive to all peoples of our region to move ahead on the road of economic  social and cultural development in an atmosphere of security  stability  freedom and democracy  and in the context of cooperation and understanding  resulting in well-being and prosperity for the peoples of the region as a whole. Justice  comprehensiveness and durability are the bases on which peace in the Middle East should be established. These bases are organically interrelated and inseparable. It is regrettable  however  that while we are engaged in direct peace negotiations with Israel  it persists in its acts of repression and oppression of every type against the Palestinian people under its occupation. It is a strange paradox indeed that while the parties to the conflict are negotiating on the basis of international legality  Israel continues its illegal practices  especially the building of new settlements and the beefing up of existing ones. It is true that the new Israeli Government has taken certain seemingly positive actions with regard to its policies in the occupied territories. Those actions are  however  inadequate. We  and the world as a whole  are still waiting for Israel to translate its words into deeds. The classification of settlements into security and political settlements is a ploy that aims at breaking up into pieces the principle of legality  which is indivisible. The release of some detainees while thousands of others languish in jail  will not alter the degree of repression to which the Palestinian people are being subjected. If the Israeli Government truly wishes to be serious in its desire to achieve peace and wants to demonstrate good will  it has first to commit itself to the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the occupied territories and to halt completely the building of settlements - all settlements. With regard to Lebanon  Israel continues to refuse to comply with Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which calls for Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Accordingly  we call for unconditional Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territory and call for solidarity by the international community with Lebanon to help the Lebanese Government in rebuilding its economic and social structures and enabling its people to achieve the security  welfare and prosperity they yearn for. The various Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq have placed the State of Iraq and its people in a situation different from that they were in in 1990 and 1991. The suffering of the Iraqi people  which is known to all  and the threat of dismemberment and instability not intended by the Security Council resolutions make it imperative that we view Iraq in terms of that new situation. Proceeding from this  Jordan which complies with Security Council resolutions and looks forward to putting an end to the consequences of the Gulf crisis by peaceful means wishes to emphasize its desire for action to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people and to preserve the territorial integrity of Iraq as an integral Gulf entity. It will not be in anyone's interest  regionally or internationally  to partition Iraq or to prolong the suffering of its people. Also  it will not be in anyone's interest that security and stability should not prevail in the Gulf region. While we have great hopes that the consequences of the Gulf crisis will be eliminated  we regret to see the beginnings of a new crisis: the dispute that has erupted recently between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran is denying to the United Arab Emirates its sovereign rights over the islands of Abu Mousa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb. Jordan would like to reiterate in this regard its principled position of respect for the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. We call on the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab Emirates to reach a peaceful solution through dialogue  based on the principles of the United Nations Charter  in order to maintain good neighbourliness and consolidate peace and security in the Gulf region. The tragic situation of the Somali people poses a difficult challenge to the United Nations and to the conscience of humanity. This challenge requires an immediate and effective response. The images of death  starvation and homelessness that fill our television screens cry out to the conscience of the world to help put an end to them. My country's delegation  while appreciating and commending the incessant efforts of the new Secretary-General on both the political and the relief levels  emphasizes the need for prompt and effective action by the United Nations and the international community to adopt an integrated plan that would put an end to the tragedy of Somalia. Such a plan should include a cease-fire  the implementation of an integral programme of action to ensure the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies to the various regions and moves to convene a conference on reconciliation  national unity and transition to help rebuild the country's infrastructure. We must also deal with the regional consequences of the crisis: the influx of Somali refugees into neighbouring countries and the resulting instability this has caused in the Horn of Africa.  The tragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to deteriorate and is taking a sinister turn. To do nothing about it would undermine the very concepts of democracy  civilized behaviour and collective security. Reports continue to pour in  telling of continued violations of international humanitarian law against the people of this young nation. Its territory continues to be swallowed up bit by bit  and attempts are continuing to change its demographic composition through ferocious and atrocious ""ethnic cleansing"" campaigns. It is both painful and dangerous that all this should continue despite the relevant Security Council resolutions. There is indeed an urgent need to find a prompt and peaceful solution to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law. There is nothing that would justify in any way failure by the United Nations and the international community to take prompt and effective measures to put an end to aggression  to ensure the unity and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina  to preserve its political independence and full sovereignty over its entire territory  and to annul all the results and consequences of aggression. We trust that the peace process led by the European Community and its member States  in cooperation with the United Nations  to achieve a peaceful settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina  will give all these elements priority in its programme of work. I can only express  in this regard  my country's high appreciation of the tireless efforts made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretariat to make the peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina a success and to expand the relief operations which they are undertaking. The principles which my country upholds and which govern its positions on all international conflicts are based on the belief in the right of peoples to self-determination  in the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of States and of rejection of occupation in any shape or form. It was in this context that my country welcomed the process of reconciliation in Cambodia on the basis of the Paris accords which were signed by all the Cambodian parties. My country attaches great importance to the implementation  by all parties  of those accords and the discharge of all the commitments contained therein as those commitments constitute the guarantee and the proper mechanism for a peaceful and comprehensive settlement that will restore peace to this war-torn country within the framework of national reconciliation in a united  independent and sovereign Cambodia. As for the question of Korea  my country's delegation would like to voice its complete satisfaction in regard to the progress of the dialogue and high-level talks going on between the two Koreas and the resultant agreements aimed at building mutual confidence between them and reuniting the Korean peninsula in a framework of national unity. With regard to the question of Cyprus  my country values the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  who has maintained the good offices which started in 1975. We follow with close interest and great appreciation the ongoing talks under his auspices and with his encouragement between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities with the aim of achieving a peaceful settlement of this problem. Jordan shares with the rest of the world the satisfaction felt at the results of the referendum organized by the Government of South Africa in March. Those results were a constructive prelude to end the policy of apartheid in South Africa and augur well for the achievement by the conflicting groups of a comprehensive political settlement in a democratic system  which would put an end to minority rule. The agreement reached a few days ago between Mr. Mandela and President De Klerk on the resumption of talks  following the deplorable violence of last June  renews hope that all parties will cooperate in writing a new constitution and reaching an early political solution  thus putting an end to the policy of apartheid and allowing democracy to prevail. My Government deplores the bloody events that took place recently in Afghanistan and visited yet more suffering on the Afghani people. Therefore Jordan  while wishing the Afghani Government success in consolidating security and stability and in reconstructing the infrastructure devastated by the civil war  supports that Government's request for assistance from the United Nations and the international community. The East-West bipolarity of the cold war era has disappeared with the end of that war. There has surfaced  however  a new North-South bipolarity that was overshadowed previously by the world's preoccupation with the ideological conflict between East and West. We hope that efforts to deal with this phenomenon  which is primarily economic and social  will take the form of a positive and constructive dialogue for the benefit of all mankind. The developing South needs the countries of the North; the industrialized North cannot maintain its prosperity and stability without an independent and developed South that would be free from hunger  poverty  and disease and relieved of its heavy burden of debt. The planet on which we live  with all the threats of ecological disruption facing it  cannot enjoy security and safety without cooperation between North and South. Such cooperation is in the interest of all humanity. If we were to define the new role of the United Nations  it  undoubtedly/ would be humanitarian in nature and would aim at protecting and preserving life on the planet  and raising the standard of living of all peoples through the establishment of a new  balanced and equitable world economic order. Our Organization must act to put an end to the historical contradiction that has persisted for centuries between North and South so that the North may discharge the main task of providing new bases and common grounds for a real development of the regions of the South and thus remove the existing distortions and inequalities. It has become quite clear that a common effort for development is essential to move the world gradually forward  if freedom and democracy are really to gain acceptance and if we really want to respect human dignity and eradicate underdevelopment and its concomitant social and health evils  which have assumed terrifying proportions and frequency. The environment is the common heritage of mankind. Thus  my country believes that its preservation is our common responsibility. We also feel that the developed countries  in accordance with the commitments they took upon themselves at the Rio de Janeiro Conference  must help the developing countries in solving their relevant problems  especially and principally  the problem of poverty. We therefore support the establishment of the committee on sustainable development and look forward to participating in it and in shaping its structure and terms of reference. If international peace and security are among the main goals the international community strives to achieve  that makes it all the more imperative for us to promote arms limitation  including the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. One must note in this regard the progress achieved in the limitation of tactical nuclear weapons and the finalization recently at Geneva of the draft Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. As for conventional weapons  the General Assembly resolution adopted at the forty-sixth session on the establishment of a non-discriminatory register in which to record all international weapon transfers was a positive step on the road to getting rid of armaments  provided it is applied with complete impartiality and in an equitable manner that takes into consideration the differences in the needs of countries for armaments. A verification system should be developed  taking into account not only imported weapons but also domestically produced weapons  especially in countries that are involved in regional conflicts. Jordan supports the use of science and technology for disarmament  the development of verification systems  the efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive nuclear-test ban and the establishment of nuclear-free zones  including the Middle East region. Jordan also calls upon all States that have not done so  including Israel  to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and place all their nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In conclusion  I should like to say that  now that the cold war has ended  the world undoubtedly stands at the threshold of a new era  as we can all see. This fact places on the United Nations the responsibility of reinvigorating itself in order to keep pace with the requirements of this new era in a fast-changing world  so that our efforts at the United Nations may become a foundation for a better life. We are quite confident that the Member States are all aware of their problems and the problems of the world and are  therefore  prepared for cooperation and the use of good offices within a democratic United Nations and the efforts of its evolving organs and agencies that are guided by the vision and dedication of the Secretary-General. "
"82",3621,"JPN",47,1992,"I should like  first of all  to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. At the same time  I wish to express to Mr. Samir Shihabi my appreciation for what was accomplished under his presidency. His visit to Japan in April 1992 further strengthened my country's close ties to the United Nations. Last year  seven nations were admitted to membership in the United Nations  and this year  another thirteen became Members. On behalf of the Government and people of Japan  I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the representatives of the nations attending this General Assembly for the first time. Now numbering 179 Members  the United Nations is indeed a global Organization. At the same time  its role in maintaining world peace and security is increasing dramatically  thus presenting the international community with unparalleled opportunities for realizing the ideals of the United Nations Charter. Member States have extremely high expectations of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali  who bears the awesome burdens of his office at a particularly crucial juncture. I take this opportunity to pledge Japan's full support for  and cooperation with  President Ganev and Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali as we pursue our common goals. Now  nearly half a century after the United Nations was founded  the international community has been freed from the constraints of East-West confrontation based on ideology and force. Nevertheless  this post-cold-war world faces problems arising from the changing power relationship between the nations that dominated the old international order  the resurgence of regionalism  and the destabilization of regions by ethnic  religious and other strife. The Gulf crisis showed the high political and economic costs of restoring peace once it has been destroyed. Every day  countless refugees in what used to be Yugoslavia are being forced to flee their homes. Every day brings numerous reports of atrocities there. In Somalia  the civil war  compounded by severe drought  is resulting in untold human suffering. Urgent efforts continue to be required to overcome poverty in many developing nations  home to the majority of the world's population. The preservation of the global environment for our children and grandchildren is another issue that demands our serious attention. These challenges only underscore the need to seek solutions to problems in a spirit of conciliation and cooperation among nations. This conciliatory and cooperative spirit should be a key element in advancing us towards the creation of an international order for the new era while the United Nations assumes even greater importance as the centre of our endeavours. Thus the time has come to review the roles and functions of the United Nations and seriously to consider how they may be strengthened  and to reflect upon how each of its Members might best contribute to that end. The Security Council summit meeting held in January 1992 provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine  at the level of Head of State or Government  the problems confronting the international community. In the light of the present world situation  the Secretary-General's report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  which was drafted on the basis of the deliberations at the summit  is indeed a timely contribution. I hold Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali's initiative  which was realized with the diligent assistance of the Secretariat  in the highest regard. In Japan's view  building a peaceful world will require the following five-pronged approach. First  efforts must be made to ease international tensions. The agreement reached at the summit meeting between the United States and Russia this past June to make substantial reductions in nuclear armaments is most welcome. It is hoped that this will lead to progress in nuclear disarmament by all nuclear-weapon States. The problem of proliferation demands that the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons be strengthened and made more universal. The Treaty's signatories should harmonize their positions so that when they meet in 1995 the smooth extension of the Treaty will be ensured. An important facet of non-proliferation is the provision of employment assistance to weapons scientists of the former Soviet Union. To this end  Japan is striving to make it possible for an international science and technology centre to begin operation promptly in cooperation with the United States and countries of the European Community. The conclusion of negotiations on the chemical weapons convention at the Conference on Disarmament and the anticipated submission to the General Assembly at the current session of the draft convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons constitute an epochal step forward. Japan earnestly hopes that as many nations as possible will be original signatories to this convention. Conventional weapons are another area in which the vigilance of concerned nations is called for to prevent regional destabilization  especially in the light of the major arms transfers that have already taken place in some regions. To increase the transparency of arms transfers and thereby strengthen trust among nations  it is important that the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms  the establishment of which Japan proposed jointly with the European Community and other countries last year  be implemented effectively. Japan and its partners in this effort plan to submit a draft resolution to the General Assembly at this session calling for the wide participation of Member States in the Register. Secondly  stepped-up efforts are needed to forestall the outbreak of conflicts. Thus far  Japan has played an active role in the adoption of such General Assembly resolutions as the Declaration on conflict prevention (43/51) and the Declaration on United Nations fact-finding (46/59). To strengthen the conflict-prevention function of the United Nations  the Secretary-General must have the capacity  inter alia  to conduct fact-finding missions  to issue early warnings and to monitor constantly the situation in potential conflict zones. For this purpose  it is important that information about conflicts be made immediately available to the Secretary-General. In addition  I propose that there be set up within the United Nations Secretariat a conflict-information clearing-house. This office would collate information on conflicts collected through the fact-finding activities of the Secretariat or provided by Governments  and would present it in an objective manner to the Security Council and to Member States so as to help them formulate their judgments on the situation. I should also note here that Japan is in basic agreement with the concept of preventive diplomacy described in the Secretary-General's report  but the idea of preventive deployment of United Nations peace-keeping operations  for example  with the consent of only one party to a conflict involves problems which require further study. Thirdly  stronger diplomatic efforts should be made by Members of the United Nations to resolve conflicts peacefully. Considering the recent spate of regional conflicts  efforts to resolve them by regional organizations and United Nations Member States are increasingly essential. The efforts led by the European Community to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia and the efforts by the countries in the Asian region and the five permanent members of the Security Council to restore peace in Cambodia are examples of the kind of action to which I refer. The steps now being taken by the countries concerned towards peace in the Middle East also deserve to be hailed. Japan  for its part  also intends to play an active role in the multilateral consultations. I intend to see that Japan continues to step up its diplomatic efforts to build peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. As far as peace in Cambodia is concerned  Japan has been playing an active role by  for example  hosting the Ministerial Meeting on the Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Cambodia in Tokyo this past June. In cooperation with other countries  Japan will continue its intensive and unremitting efforts to urge the Khmer Rouge to work with the other parties in Cambodia and with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to advance the peace process quickly. Japan also intends to take an active part in the Security Council deliberations on this issue. Easing tensions on the Korean peninsula is of vital importance for peace and stability in east Asia  and Japan intends to contribute in every way it can to the creation of an environment conducive to dialogue between South and North Korea. In this connection  Japan welcomes the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Republic of Korea and hopes that this will lead to ever-broader exchanges between the two countries in the future. I welcome the idea mentioned by President Roh Tae Woo of the Republic of Korea in his address earlier today of enhancing opportunities for dialogue among interested countries in north-east Asia  an idea that is consistent with Japan's own thinking. I consider it vitally important for Japan's relationship with its neighbour  the Russian Federation  to expand in all aspects on a balanced basis. In this connection  I believe that the building of a relationship of trust between Japan and Russia through the conclusion of a peace treaty will greatly contribute to peace and stability in the region. Fourthly  peace-keeping operations  which are at the very centre of the primary role of the United Nations  should be strengthened. Extending to new areas of responsibility  and with an ever-greater range of activity  United Nations peace-keeping operations have evolved both qualitatively and quantitatively in recent years. As mentioned in the Secretary-General's report  however  they are confronted with many problems  including increased demands for funding and a shortage of logistical personnel. More active cooperation by Member States of the United Nations is therefore essential. Last June  the Japanese Diet passed the International Peace Cooperation Law  which put in place domestic arrangements that finally enable Japan to participate in United Nations peace-keeping operations and international humanitarian relief operations. In addition to the financial contributions it has thus far extended  Japan intends to cooperate by sending personnel to the maximum degree allowed within the framework of this new law. In fact  a decision has already been made to send election monitors to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) in Angola to oversee the elections there  and to send military observers  a construction unit and civilian police to the United Nations Transition Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The first teams have already been dispatched. Japan also plans to send election monitors to Cambodia for the elections scheduled there next year. Japan believes that the principles and practices of peace-keeping operations upheld by the United Nations for more than 40 years are still both appropriate and valid today and will continue to be so in the future. The idea of ""peace-enforcement units""  proposed in the Secretary-General's report  offers an interesting approach to future peace-making efforts of the United Nations  but requires further study because it is rooted in a mode of thinking completely different from past peace-keeping forces. Fifthly  in order to build peace throughout the world  dialogue and cooperation should be strengthened and developed as appropriate to the situation in each region. Europe's regional cooperation mechanisms  typified by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  have grown out of efforts for confidence-building against a backdrop of past conflicts. They have evolved into frameworks for working together to achieve regional stability and prosperity  and have begun to work to prevent conflicts and augment their peace-keeping capability in specific ways. Regional cooperation for peace and prosperity in other parts of the world has not yet matured to the same degree as in Europe. Ways should be explored to achieve forms of dialogue and cooperation that are well grounded in the political and geopolitical characteristics of each region and tailored to its needs. With respect to security in the Asia-Pacific region  Japan considers it important to maintain and strengthen the frameworks for dealing with issues either bilaterally or among several countries concerned  and  simultaneously  to seek to promote region-wide dialogue. I believe that  at the present time  one of the forums that has the greatest potential for such region-wide dialogue is the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Post-Ministerial Conference. Japan suggested last year that this forum be used for political dialogue of the type to which I am referring. In an effort to promote greater cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region which at the same time is open to the outside world  Japan has been contributing actively to the development of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). I should now like to turn to the question of responding to new threats. The threats facing humankind today are not all military. Problems relating to the deterioration of the global environment  refugees  poverty  overpopulation  drugs  AIDS and other threats of a non-military nature are becoming increasingly serious. It is not enough simply to treat the symptoms; the United Nations and the international community must join hands to remove the causes of these ills. It is no exaggeration to say that the solution to these problems will demand the utmost of humanity's collective knowledge and the application of its highest ethical and moral standards. In this connection  I wish to re-emphasize the importance of respect for human rights. Fundamental human rights are not only a universally cherished value  but are also fundamental to ensuring a better life for each individual and the development of a democratic society. The lack of respect for humanitarian law and for the rights of minorities in recent conflict areas is deeply disturbing. With the end of the cold war  it is incumbent upon the international community to grapple more seriously with the problem of poverty in the developing world  since the maintenance of world order hinges largely upon whether and to what degree the North and South cooperate. The United Nations must redouble its efforts to combat poverty and to eliminate the causes of social instability - which is rooted in poverty in the recognition that economic development raises standards of living and thereby enhances political stability. In addressing the issue of poverty  we must bear in mind that conditions differ from country to country. The economies of some countries are about to take off  others are on the verge of solving their spiralling debt problems  and others such as the sub-Saharan countries are still experiencing crushing economic difficulties. We must therefore search for an approach that is finely tuned to these differing circumstances. Japan intends to assist United Nations efforts to deal more effectively with these problems that affect all of humanity. For example  cognizant of its role as a responsible member of the international community  Japan plans to host an African development conference in autumn next year in Tokyo with the cooperation and participation of sub-Saharan nations  major aid donors  the United Nations and other international agencies to discuss the theme of economic development in Africa. Another timely event that addresses these problems is the United Nations social development summit  scheduled for 1995. Japan intends to cooperate actively in both these meetings to ensure that they will be genuinely fruitful. I turn now to the subject of the environment and development. It is very important that the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held recently in Rio de Janeiro  be maintained. Japan intends to make active contributions to the work of the sustainable development committee  the establishment of which is on the agenda of this General Assembly session  and of such international environmental agencies as the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development Programme. The process of making the necessary domestic arrangements is now under way. Japan will soon finalize the draft of its national action programme  and is prepared to assist developing countries in the formulation of theirs. In accordance with its stated goal that its environment-related official development assistance be increased to between 900 billion and 1 trillion yen over the next five years  Japan will strive to identify  formulate and implement the best projects through policy dialogue with developing countries. At this stage I wish to confirm Japan's proposal that a special session of the General Assembly devoted to environmental issues  as a follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  be held before 1997. Whereas refugees are returning to their homes in Cambodia and other parts of the world  the refugee problem in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia remains extremely serious. The international community must unite to address such complex problems as shelter  emergency aid  and assistance in reintegrating refugees following their voluntary return home. Japan will continue to be active in extending humanitarian aid through the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other international agencies. Population is another problem facing all humankind - a problem that demands the cooperation of both developed and developing countries. Japan wishes  in preparation for the 1994 world population and development conference  and with the cooperation of the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the United Nations University  to hold in 1994 a meeting of eminent world authorities on demographic issues  and in this regard we sincerely ask for the cooperation of Member States. I wish to refer now to steps towards revitalization of the United Nations. The United Nations is currently faced with a number of structural problems. These relate to its organization which has not adapted fully to the changing times to the serious budget crisis  and to the insufficiency of communication between United Nations agencies. First  the most serious requirement of the United Nations as a global Organization today is legitimacy  trustworthiness and efficacy. If the United Nations is to realize the ideals and purposes of the Charter - based on legitimacy  trustworthiness and efficacy including the maintenance of international peace and security  it must have the complete confidence of its Members. In this respect  the United Nations must reshape itself in response to the epochal changes that we have recently witnessed changes that could not have been foreseen when the Organization was founded. These include the rapid transformations in the international situation  the dramatic increase in United Nations membership and shifts in global power relations. However  the United Nations Charter itself still contains historical relics  such as the former-enemies clauses. And the way in which the Organization is structured makes one question whether it can effectively meet expectations. With the aim  in part  of enhancing trust in  and the efficacy of  the Security Council  which has a particularly important role in the maintenance of international peace and security  Japan believes that it is necessary to consider seriously just how the United Nations as a whole should be structured. This effort should include consideration of the functions  composition and other aspects of the Security Council. In my view  it is necessary for the United Nations itself to begin to deal with this issue with a view to strengthening its functions. The year 1995  which will be the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization  may prove to be an important juncture in the process of addressing this issue. The re-examination of the structure of the United Nations should also be accompanied by reform of the Economic and Social Council  which plays a role as important as that of the Security Council. The discussions on the Economic and Social Council that are currently being held in this direction are a welcome development. The second crisis facing the United Nations is that of the budget deficit. The United Nations is on the verge of bankruptcy. If it is to emerge from its chronic shortage of funds. Member States must honour their obligations and immediately pay their assessed contributions. It is imperative that those Member States that are in arrears pay what they owe. The rapidly increasing demand for funds to finance peace-keeping operations must  in the light of the importance of these operations  be met. In particular  the availability of funding at the start-up stage of an operation is of crucial.importance and could determine the outcome of the operation as a whole. Japan therefore plans to put before the General Assembly at the current session a draft resolution to ensure that the financial requirements of major peace-keeping operations at the start-up stage will be met without imposing new financial burdens on Member States. I sincerely hope that this draft resolution will receive wide support from Member States. The third problem concerns insufficient communication among United Nations agencies. Better communication among the component agencies of the United Nations is necessary to ensure that the limited resources of the United Nations are used effectively and that the Organization's full potential is realized. Specifically  it is important to improve liaison between the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council  and communication between the Security Council and the General Assembly. The establishment  for example  of a mechanism for periodic exchanges of view and close contact between and among the Presidents of the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council  and the General Assembly either two or three at a time should be considered. Furthermore  it is important for the Economic and Social Council to have access to  and to provide the Security Council with  information as provided in Article 65 of the Charter. Finally  whenever a major peace-keeping operation is undertaken that will entail a major financial commitment  it is essential that there be established a mechanism for consultations among the permanent members of the Security Council  the major sources of financial support  the countries providing large contingents of operations personnel and the countries of the regions concerned. The United Nations is entering an era of greater potential than it has ever experienced in its history of nearly half a century. This is also a time  however  that will test whether the United Nations can evolve into a global organization with the capability to achieve peace and prosperity for all humankind. The very magnitude of the challenges and tasks that lie ahead demand that now  more than ever before  each Member State be keenly aware of its responsibilities and carry its share of the burden. Attaching central importance to the United Nations  and committed to its own ideals as a peace-loving State  Japan is determined to contribute to the international community in a manner that is commensurate with its position and responsibilities in terms not only of financial resources but also of personnel and by enhancing its political role in the effort to build a new order of peace. And as a non-permanent member of the Security Council  Japan is striving to bring about a more peaceful world. I should like to conclude with the pledge that I shall do my utmost to see that Japan  in a spirit of conciliation and cooperation  continues to enhance its active contributions to the international community. "
"83",3646,"KAZ",47,1992,"First  I should like to express our profound satisfaction. Sir  at your election to your high post  and we wish you every success in carrying out your duties as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its current session. At the preceding session the Republic of Kazakhstan was unanimously admitted as a Member of the United Nations. On behalf of the people of Kazakhstan  I have the honour to express our deep gratitude for that step and to declare that the Republic of Kazakhstan  as a peace-loving State  is fully capable of fulfilling its obligations  as defined in the Charter of the United Nations  and of making a constructive contribution in all the spheres of activity of this authoritative international Organization. The current session is no less important for us  since during this session the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan has for the first time  been given the opportunity to speak from this rostrum. I take this opportunity to extend cordial greetings to all the States Members of the United Nations. It would be difficult by now to conceive of the present world order without the United Nations. The world community places many hopes in  this unique international organization  chief among them being the formation of a reliable machinery  reliable stability and security. The world has now come close to the threshold beyond which the visible disturbing challenges of the future compel us to adopt a new quality of coordination  a new way to organize our joint efforts. We must clarify what is the essence of this new and as yet unknown process  and we must master it within the context of our whole community  our continent  our region and our own country. These are the aspects on which I should like to focus Members' attention. The first aspect relates to the world community itself and the role of the United Nations in the world. At this session there has already emerged an understanding of the new realities  which must be defined in a new agenda for the entire world. It is no accident that this is the title of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's well-known report. We believe that his concept of preventive diplomacy is an extremely timely  politically rational initiative  in the realization of which all members of the world community should become involved. In this connection I regard preventive diplomacy as a system of political and socio-economic measures designed to prevent hotbeds of potential tension from bursting into flame. An important place in it is occupied by the conditions which are needed for maintaining social and political stability and are visible on the surface and by those problems the detection of whose very existence requires prognosticatory analysis in depth. It is not difficult to understand that the question of borders is a powder-keg that could explode at any moment  and the explosion usually hurts not only those who are playing with fire but also many others who have only a very remote connection with the fuse-lighters. In my view  it is obvious that even one precedent in the revision of currently existing borders would cause a chain reaction of geopolitical disintegration with unforeseeable consequences. In referring to the importance of the principle of the inviolability of State territory-  I should like to emphasize that the rights of national minorities today are often thought to be identical with the rights of nations to self-determination  extending even to the establishment of independent States. If we were to hold to such an approach  then  hypothetically speaking  thousands of economically weak sovereign States might arise all over  the world. Such a situation would be a striking demonstration of turning a principle into a fetish  carrying it to the ultimate absurdity. I am convinced that the world community  which today quite rightly gives so much attention to the rights of national minorities  should define clearly the criteria for such rights  in order to ensure that human rights and the rights of nations will triumph on the basis of the triumph of democracy and peace. Otherwise  under cover of a nation's right to self-determination  the integrity of any national State will be called into question  and the corrosive principle of separatism will go on without end. At the same time  taking a look forward from the present day to the twenty-first century in a search for hotbeds of potential tension  I wish to draw the world community's attention  among other questions that give cause for great concern  to the problem of water in the Central Asian region  which in time might become a source of dangerous disputes in the very heart of the oldest continent. I am convinced that we need to speed up work now  not later  on the preparation of special United Nations projects that would provide for a gradual and effective solution to the problem of furnishing water resources to Central Asia. I must point out that the decrease in geopolitical tension along East-West lines and the increasingly dangerous confrontation between North and South is a universally recognized fact. However  the emergence and exacerbation of the second confrontation do not decrease the timeliness of the first. The long-standing complexity of relations between East and West cannot he dissipated with the breakup of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Accordingly  I believe that the proposed efforts for preventive diplomacy in establishing  keeping and enhancing the peace should be exerted equally along all the lines of global interaction. I stress this because some distortions have already become visible in this connection. United Nations efforts  to judge from the events of recent months  are predominantly political and military-political in nature. We see more use being made of prohibitions than of encouragement and incentives. These measures are aimed at reducing the tensions  visible on the surface  but so far they have not had any influence on the roots of the conflicts that have arisen and grown. The real cause of these conflicts was recently pointed out from this rostrum. The richest 20 per cent of the world's people  in the Northern and Western countries  consume 83 per cent of the world's gross product  and the poorest 20 per cent of the world's people  in the countries of the South and the East  only 1.4 per cent. As we can see  the income of the richest 20 per cent is 60 times that of the poorest 20 per cent. I would call this 60 to 1 ratio the formula for world inequality. Until this gap begins to narrow  we shall not have a real basis for the comprehensive prevention of conflicts. I emphasize that  in the final analysis  we are not talking about redistributing the income of the wealthiest 20 per cent for the benefit of the poor. The world inequality formula should be changed not by reducing the income of the wealthiest 20 per cent but by increasing that of the poorest through organized assistance to help their countries develop. It may be worthwhile to think about redirecting United Nations efforts towards genuine conflict prevention and finding the root causes of conflicts. What practical steps can be taken in this regard? I can understand the Secretary-General's concern over the main problem that impedes United Nations peace-keeping efforts the shortage of financial resources. It is obvious that United Nations expenditures for the establishment  maintenance and enhancement of peace must be increased each year. But how can this be done? As is well known  until 1992  United Nations expenditures on peace-keeping totalled approximately US$8.3 billion  not even 1 per cent of total annual defence expenditures in all countries at the end of the last decade  which was approximately 1 trillion dollars. I propose that all countries should  as a demonstration of their good will  begin to set up a fund for United Nations peacemaking efforts on the basis of the ""one plus one"" formula. This means that each State would begin to transfer 1 per cent of its defence budget to the fund and would increase its transfers by the same 1 per cent each year. Thus the amount allocated to peacemaking in 10 years would increase tenfold. I think that the national security of every member of the world community would be by no means harmed but  on the contrary  actually strengthened by such an action. It is appropriate to recall here the Eastern story which tells of some people who held a contest of strength. One showed the power of his muscles and fists  another found strength in the hardness of his skull  the third in his fleetness of foot  the fourth in the sharpness of his tongue. But a wise man  remembering the heart  without which no strength is possible  suggested that they should compete in generosity. The generosity of each country will be what determines the degree to which my proposal is implemented a sort of competition for the benefit of the whole world. The Republic of Kazakhstan is ready to begin this process immediately. There are. of course  also other ways that can be provided for States to contribute to the fund for United Nations peacemaking efforts. The second aspect on which I should like to dwell is the problem of peace and security in our continent of Asia or  more broadly  in Eurasia. I am referring to the initiative put forward by the Republic of Kazakhstan to hold a conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICMA). The idea of establishing structures for security and cooperation in Asia of the same type as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) has long been in the air but has not yet gained wide support. The useful experience of the activities of continental organizations in the Americas  in Africa and in Europe should  it would seem  impel Asia as well to establish unified bodies for interaction and cooperation. But this is not happening  and there are quite a few real reasons for that fact. Politicians and analysts critical of the idea of setting up structures for security and cooperation in Asia often advance the weighty argument that the level of geographical  historical  economic  political social and cultural heterogeneity among Asian countries is much higher than that among the countries of Europe  the Americas  or Africa. Such heterogeneity in economic and political matters naturally interferes with the action of continental structures for collective security. This can be countered with a well-known piece of Oriental wisdom: A journey of a thousand steps starts with the first step. It is by no means necessary to move towards a unified Asian structure and collective security in all these types of interaction at once. It is sufficient to start levelling out the heterogeneity in one area - for instance  in the military-political or economic sphere - and then look for joint approaches in other fields of cooperation. The move towards such a continental structure could take place in many steps and on a stage-by-stage basis. For example  it could go from bilateral relations through regional and continental structures and coalitions in particular types of cooperation  through the elaboration of confidence-building measures and collective security  as well as humanitarian  economic and cultural interaction  to common continental bodies for cooperation on a broad spectrum of problems. Prospects for this process and its main stages might be as follows: The first stage would consist of preparatory work to organize and conduct the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICMA). The approximate time-frame would be 1992 to 1994. The second stage would involve accelerating the work of CICMA  increasing the number of its members  adapting it to the framework of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Asia (CSCA) and forming pan-Asian structures of the CSCE type. The approximate time-frame could be 1994 to 1998. The third stage would include defining the development of CSCA  strengthening its permanent structures  interaction between CSCE and CSCA and the creation of transcontinental bodies in particular areas of cooperation. The approximate time-frame would be 1998 to 2000. The fourth stage would consist in forming a unified transcontinental conference on security and cooperation in Eurasia and creating machinery for permanent interaction between the continental systems of collective security in Asia  Europe  Africa and the Americas  with the further prospect of setting up a unified global system of collective security and cooperation. The approximate time-frame would be 2000 to 2005. We in Asia live in a remarkable land. All the major religions of the world Judaism  Buddhism  Christianity and Islam were born in the sacred soil of our continent. All the spiritual teachers of mankind  ranging from Lao-tse and Gautama Buddha  Jesus Christ and Muhammad to the greatest of contemporary thinkers  of the calibre of Mahatma Gandhi  were born in our part of the world. Is it not possible for Asia to absorb everything that has been accumulated over the ages and synthesize a new concept of continental cooperation and collective security? This position by no means presupposes any regional autarky. We are not going to lock ourselves within continental borders. On the contrary  in the interests of Asian countries and peoples  we shall collect the best of what was born in other parts of the world. I am convinced that we must make a collective search for the best way to meet the challenges of the future and lay new foundations for mankind's existence in a world more integrated than ever before. Accordingly  I suggest that we should convene a special session or a United Nations conference to discuss the problems of the post-confrontation era  for it is the mission of the United Nations to play a decisive role in confirming new levels of organization in the international community. The United Nations itself should probably be reorganized to a certain extent  and this includes the question of the membership of the Security Council. The third aspect  which we cannot fail to mention  concerns the events that are taking place in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The fragile structure of our Commonwealth  set up at the end of last year  does not yet fully take into account the age-old traditions of interaction between States and peoples in this part of Eurasia. As a result  the processes of transition to free-market economics and democracy in the CIS are accompanied by increasing socio-economic and political instability  the exacerbation of existing conflicts and the emergence of new ones. Kazakhstan is making every possible effort to re-establish a common customs and economic area in a new capacity within the framework of a unified free-trade zone. Realists in the CIS have no illusions as far as the $24 billion of assistance promised to Russia is concerned. We take a calm view of the neo-isolationist policy that some of the world's countries are pursuing towards the CIS. We realize that only we ourselves  through our own efforts  can stop industrial decline  the severing of economic ties  hyperinflation and other destructive processes. However  we cannot rule out the possibility that despite efforts to strengthen the principles of coordination and the process of integration  contradictory trends may prevail in the CIS in the immediate future  so that the entire territory of the Commonwealth could turn into an area of instability and disintegration. I am certain that such a tragic outcome would not be in the interest of anyone in the world. In this connection  I believe that the concept of early conflict detection and preventive diplomacy might find direct practical implementation in the former Soviet federation. I am referring primarily to strengthening the areas of stability that exist in the CIS and then gradually expanding their borders by reducing tensions in the areas of conflict. To that end  I propose setting up a regional centre  or a United Nations commission  on preventive diplomacy in Central Asia. The headquarters of the centre could be located at Alma-Ata  the capital of our State. Lastly  I should like to discuss the vitally important issues of ecology and environmental protection. For Kazakhstan  these issues are embodied in at least two areas  the Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk. The Aral Sea drying up; it is a zone of ecological catastrophe that demands large-scale international emergency assistance. The desertification of its basin  accompanied by the dissemination of 150 million tons of salty dust  is causing drastic deterioration of the environment and increasing the negative effects on the economy and the health of a vast region with a population of more than 300 million inhabitants. If today this means tragedy for tens of thousands of people  tomorrow  without emergency intervention by the United Nations  it could mean tragedy for millions. Kazakhstan is grateful for the decision by the leadership of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to set up an assistance project for developing a plan to save the Aral Sea and also grateful for the suggestion by a group of UNEP experts that the Aral Sea basin should be declared a zone of global ecological disaster. The other severe ecological problem we are suffering from involves the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site  which was built on Kazakh land against the will of our people. The total power of the nuclear warheads that were set off here in the atmosphere  on the ground and underground brought suffering to more than half a million people; it is hundreds of times as large as the power of the devices that brought tragedy to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By a decision of our Government  we have closed down this source of death  but tremendous amounts of resources will be needed to clean up this region  to cure those who have suffered and to ensure the safety of the children who will again be born here. The people of Kazakhstan will therefore need active international assistance. Today  on 5 October  we celebrate the anniversary of the creation of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat). Recognizing its unquestionable importance  Kazakhstan hopes for effective technical and advisory assistance from the Centre to our programmes of governmental development for urban and rural construction. The Kazakh people has a proverb  ""Elu zhylda el zhana "" which literally means  ""The world becomes new every 50 years"". The first half-century of the existence of the United Nations has been marked by confrontation between super-Powers and the burden of opposing military blocs. Now the world community has a historic opportunity to find in the form of the United Nations the means to bring about effective cooperation in the name of peace and progress. We must do our utmost to take full advantage of it. "
"84",3693,"KEN",47,1992,"First of all  let me join the other representatives who have spoken before me in congratulating you warmly. Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election to this high office is not only proof of the confidence which the Assembly has in you  but a great honour as well to your country  Bulgaria. We are confident that  under your able leadership  our deliberations will be steered to a successful conclusion. I also wish to pay a tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  for the great diplomatic skills with which he successfully led the forty-sixth session. We are happy to welcome the several Members that joined our Organization in the past year. With their admission  the United Nations has moved once again closer to the realization of the principle of universality of membership. We are encouraged by their commitment to the principles and objectives of the Charter and we look forward to working closely with them in the days ahead in creating a better world for mankind through this Organization. Their admission comes at a very significant moment in the history of the United Nations  a time when our Organization is undergoing revitalization and reorganization and is poised to meet the new challenges in the rapidly changing international scene.* The successes of the United Nations and the important contribution that it is expected to make towards the maintenance of international peace and security will in no small measure depend on the efforts of our new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. We commend him for his timely report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  in which he analyses and offers pragmatic recommendations on ways of strengthening and making more efficient the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. Security based on the old theory of deterrence has failed to guarantee mankind a world without the threat of war and nuclear holocaust. Kenya believes that peace is not merely the absence of war but the absence of the threat of war or of the use of force in international relations and in all spheres of life as well. The end of super-Power rivalry and the demise of the cold-war era offer the world a rare opportunity not only to reorganize international relations but also to create a peaceful atmosphere devoid of nuclear threat. Positive steps have been taken in Geneva in the Conference on Disarmament through the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the chemical weapons Convention. Kenya is happy to be among the many States which have sponsored a draft resolution  to be placed before this Assembly at the current session  on chemical and bacteriological weapons under the Convention on the prohibition of the development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. As important as all these developments are  Kenya still holds to the view that a comprehensive test ban is the only viable way of stopping the momentum of the nuclear arms race. It is the most appropriate tool for practical arms control policies geared towards preventing further arms escalation. In this regard  the accession by China and France to the non-proliferation Treaty is a welcome step in the right direction. Kenya welcomed without reservation the collapse of the bipolar structure of the cold war. However  the consequences of the change have been devastating to some and catastrophic to others. One thing is clear. The changes  although desired and necessary  have come in too rapidly for most. Consequently  instead of being a triumph for democracy  the changes now present a serious challenge  not only for democracy and the survival of the democratic institutions they were meant to strengthen  but also a severe test of the will and the capacity of the United Nations and its institutions to respond effectively to the resultant crises. Somalia is a particularly distressing example. In the words of our Secretary-General  as contained in his report of 11 September 1992 on the work of this Organization: ""Somalia poses a particularly difficult challenge to the United Nations. A means must be found of responding to the urgent and overwhelming needs of a population increasingly desperate in the face of widespread hunger  the absence of national administration  almost complete destruction of basic infrastructure and acute insecurity."" (A/47/1  para. 145) As a neighbour to Somalia  Kenya has had to bear more than its fair share of Somali refugees  now standing at well over half a million people. Close to 6 million out of Somali's population of 7 million people are in serious distress  with some 2 million condemned to certain death before this human tragedy is eventually brought to a conclusion.  We thank the Secretary-General and his team for their tireless efforts in putting together a comprehensive and multifaceted programme of action covering humanitarian relief  the consolidation of a cease-fire  the reduction of organized violence and national reconciliation. The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs  Ambassador Jan Eliasson  has also done commendably well in coordinating United Nations assistance to Somalia. Kenya still remains ready to offer the necessary facilities to United Nations agencies  and inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations to assist Somalia. While humanitarian assistance is of the utmost priority in the present circumstances  we in Kenya have not lost sight of the paramount importance of the need for a round table. There is absolutely no alternative to dialogue. My President  His Excellency Daniel Arap Moi  has constantly reminded the Somali leaders that they must put the interests of the Somali people before their own narrow and personal interests. Kenya will do whatever it can  along with its neighbours  to assist all Somali factions  without exclusion  to come together and discuss a durable solution to this tragedy. Elsewhere in Africa there have been encouraging trends of reconciliation and amicable solutions to ethnic or ideological conflicts  which have retarded progress for decades. We salute the people of Mozambique and Angola for opting for dialogue to solve their differences. We also look forward to a peaceful solution  at long last  to the problems of Cambodia and divided Korea  and support the initiatives in Central America to solve their problems through the regional approach  as provided for in the Charter. The situation in the Middle East is still far from settled. However we express cautious optimism at the current rounds of talks initiated by Secretary of State James Baker  involving the most important protagonists in the Middle East conflict  the Palestinians. The developments in South Africa are also of great encouragement to us. We look forward to the resumption of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) talks in order to accelerate movement towards genuine democracy in that country. This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time of increased globalization of the world economy with promising opportunities for all countries  rich and poor. Unfortunately the benefits accruing from this globalization are not being uniformly distributed. The economies of the developing countries are characterized by a mounting debt burden  negative balance-of-payments positions  declining investments  reduced external creditworthiness  and a general backsliding in economic development. The flow of international development finance to developing countries  both official and commercial  has continued to decline at a time when more is needed. This has resulted in the net outflow of resources from the developing to the developed countries. In order to reverse this negative trend  the developed countries and the international financial institutions need to intensify their efforts to increase substantially the rate of financial flows to the developing countries on a continuous and assured basis. Donor countries which have not done so should make every effort to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product in official development assistance to the developing countries as set out in the United Nations International Development Strategy. Aid conditionalities and cross-conditionalities imposed on the developing countries by a number of donors should be lifted. They are unrealistically stringent and counter-productive. There is  therefore  urgent need for donors to re-examine their policies in international cooperation in order to avoid actions that hurt the already debt-ridden economies of the recipient countries. The external debt crisis of the developing countries is being exacerbated by volatile exchange rates and currency fluctuations  the collapse of commodity prices  a general deterioration in the terms of trade of the debtor countries and the domestic financial and economic policies of the creditor countries. In an effort to lower inflation the creditor countries have adopted measures which have reduced opportunities for the exports of the developing countries and led to higher interest rates  further jeopardizing the ability of the debtor countries to meet their debt obligations. Kenya feels that any meaningful solution to the debt crisis must address the real causes of the problem with a view to obtaining a durable solution. We welcome the efforts taken by some members of the donor community to reduce or cancel the debts owed by the developing countries. An effective and lasting solution to the debt problem of developing countries can be achieved only through measures directed towards the revitalization of the economic growth and development of the developing countries. Trade protectionism and the failure by the developed countries totally to observe international trade practices have also contributed to reduced market opportunities for the exports of the developing countries. Protectionism  along with subsidies  has adversely affected the ability of the developing countries  particularly those in Africa  to earn badly needed foreign exchange and has resulted in developing countries losing some $500 billion a year. That is 10 times more than the amount of foreign assistance granted to these countries. The situation is worsened by the steeply declining prices of commodities on which many developing countries are highly dependent. Since the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989  for example  coffee-producing countries have lost more than $10 billion. In order to reverse this unfavourable trend  the developed countries should dismantle protectionism in world trade and ensure that inward-looking regionalism and economic blocs do not undermine the multilateral trading system. There is urgent need for an early and successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) multilateral trade negotiations. The liberalization programmes supported by the donor community  especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank  should balance between promoting a market for the industrialized countries and making the exports of developing countries more competitive in the world market. These programmes should also support processing in the developing countries to give their products a higher added value in order to fetch more in international markets. Some developing countries  including Kenya  with the support of the IMF and the World Bank  are implementing structural adjustment programmes. While our countries accept the objectives of these structural adjustments  the rates and sometimes the methods of implementation advocated by the donor community  particularly the IMF and the World Bank  are out of step with our political  economic or social capacity to absorb them. Kenya is convinced that the sustainability of these programmes cannot be guaranteed unless they are compatible with political and social situations in the recipient countries. Kenya believes that peace  security and stability cannot be assured in the face of the abject poverty in which millions of people in developing countries live. We fully endorse the position of developing countries members of the Group of 77 that the eradication of poverty constitutes a major challenge at the present time. That must be the goal in the revitalization of growth and in sustainable development in developing countries. We equally support and endorse the recommendation of the Economic and Social Council at its 1992 substantive session that the General Assembly should convene a world summit for social development in 1995. Such a conference would contribute to the important objective of putting people at the centre of development and international cooperation. Eradication of poverty is a national objective in Kenya and every effort is being made towards that end. Kenya  like many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa  has had its share of drought and of the shortage of food  which have been compounded by the refugee problem. The persistent critical economic and social problems in Africa  coupled with the debt-burden  declining prices of commodities  vagaries of climate and weather conditions  environmental degradation  population increase  and social as well as political effects of structural adjustment  have all added to the deterioration of living standards and have frustrated efforts for economic recovery. Almost 40 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are currently faced with the threat of starvation. The Government of Kenya is most appreciative of the response of the international community and of the bilateral assistance from friendly countries  in the face of the severe drought and crop failure that gripped our country. The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs launched a Special Appeal for Kenya  alongside the Special Emergency Programme for the Horn of Africa. I wish to convey the thanks and gratitude of my country to the Secretary-General for this timely action and particularly for releasing to the United Nations Children's Fund $2 million from the Central Emergency Revolving Fund for the provision of water  emergency drugs  vaccines and shelter in the north and north-eastern areas of Kenya. We should like to make a further appeal for continued assistance in view of the overwhelming flood of refugees and the effect of the drought in Kenya. The holding of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio this year was a clear indication of the concern of humanity for the state of the global environment. It Emphasized the fact that the continuing deterioration of the environment is a serious threat to the survival of the human race and the planet Earth. The agreements reached in Rio represent a remarkable achievement by any standard despite the fact that they did not meet all our hopes and expectations in all areas. None the less  what is gratifying is that the results of the Rio Earth Summit  contained in the Rio Declaration and in Agenda 21  provide the basis for a new global partnership  embracing the rich and the poor. North and South  East and West. Noteworthy is the fact that  for the first time  the world community gave its united attention to the process of desertification  one of the problems facing the African continent and indeed Kenya. This process has given rise to untold levels of poverty and it is time we had an international legal instrument that would focus on this scourge. It is therefore pleasing to note that the Rio Conference called attention to the need to start work on an international convention on desertification  with special reference to Africa. In spite of what was accomplished at Rio  we cannot afford to be complacent. Much more needs to be done. The road from Rio will be longer and perhaps more challenging than the road to Rio. Programmes need to be implemented and treaties put into force and strengthened. While Kenya is ready to pursue the objectives of sustainable development  we have to emphasize that a positive move on the part of developed countries is needed in the implementation of provisions regarding new and additional resources and technical assistance  as well the transfer of environmentally sound technologies  to enable developing countries to play their role. Indeed  at Rio  the developed countries reaffirmed their commitment to reach the accepted target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development aid to augment their aid programmes. While this commitment is commendable  Kenya's view is that specific commitments should be spelt out  since the success and implementation of Agenda 21 will depend very heavily on  the availability of finance. We also wish to underscore that the implementation of sustainable development will be futile if developed countries and financial institutions use financial considerations as an excuse for interfering in the internal affairs of developing countries or as an opportunity to introduce conditionalities. The establishment of the Commission for Sustainable Development is important since it will provide a focal point of intergovernmental decision-making to effect the integration of the environmental and developmental strategies contained in Agenda 21. Kenya believes that the only way for the new Commission to be most effective in implementing Agenda 21 would be for the General Assembly to resist any organizational modalities and mandates that would create unnecessarily costly and large bureaucratic machinery. The Commission should operate as a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council within recognized rules of procedure and should be elaborated in the context of the ongoing revitalization and rationalization of the Council. The policy responsibilities of the Commission must be well defined to avoid conflicts with other bodies. It should be both future- and development-oriented  providing a forum for the review  further development and updating of Agenda 21 in the light of future economic  financial  technological  legal and other developments. At its forty-sixth session  the General Assembly adopted resolution 46/164  accepting the idea of convening a United Nations conference on human settlements  possibly in 1997  and requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on the item. My delegation fully supports this decision  which would offer a unique opportunity to evaluate and strengthen the progress of Habitat  taking into account the fact that urbanization is one of the fundamental environmental problems that we cannot afford to overlook. Before concluding  let me comment briefly on the Decade of International Law. At its forty-fifth session  the General Assembly declared the 1990s to be the United Nations Decade of International Law. Respect and adherence by all States to the principles and norms of international law would lead us to a more orderly world in which disputes that may arise can be resolved by peaceful means. All of us must  therefore  exert every effort to ensure that the aims of the Decade are promoted and that meaningful programmes are adopted so that the Decade may become a reality. It would also be very opportune if  in this Decade of International Law  the world were to witness not only the coming into force of the Convention on the Law of the Sea  but also its universal acceptance as the comprehensive legal order for the world seas. We therefore applaud the Secretary-General in these efforts aimed at making this a reality and we wish him well and success. We must  however  be very careful that universal acceptance of the Convention will not mean unravelling its core principle  which is that the high seas and the resources therein are and shall be exploited for the common heritage of all mankind.

"85",3717,"KGZ",47,1992,"Allow me to express my sincere congratulations to the President of the current General Assembly on his election. I should also like to wish every success to the Secretary-General in his work. This session of the General Assembly is the first one for Kyrgyzstan  as it is for other new United Nations Member States  and provides us with a unique opportunity to introduce ourselves us to the world community and to express our vision of future cooperation with the organization. Kyrgyzstan emerged as an independent State at a turning point in world history. The collapse of totalitarianism and profound geopolitical changes in the territory of the former Soviet Union enabled my Republic to seize this historic opportunity to establish itself as an independent State. Less than a month ago  we celebrated the first anniversary of our independence. From the very outset  we saw no other alternative in using the right of independent choice we obtained than the establishment of a pluralistic democracy as the only means of creating a decent life for the individual by ensuring political  economic and spiritual freedoms. The difficult process of creating a democratic legal State  strengthening inter-ethnic harmony and social accord and building the basis for a market economy is under way in Kyrgyzstan. Our criteria are the highest international standards for ensuring human rights and freedoms  and we are pursuing their implementation in all areas of political and legislative activity. These standards are set forth in the draft of our new Constitution  which our Parliament is soon to discuss. In the near future  Kyrgyzstan will also adhere to major international agreements on human rights. We appreciate the friendly view taken abroad of the democratic changes under way in Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan today is recognized by 107 countries the world over  and diplomatic relations have been established with more than 50 of them. It has become a member of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank and other international and regional institutions. Kyrgyzstan is open to sound  mutually beneficial relations and ready for partnership with those countries which share our ideals of freedom and democracy. We attach great importance to maintaining cooperation within the Commonwealth of Independent States. The meeting of Heads of State of the Commonwealth  which took place in Bishkek recently  might help strengthen integration  but we recognize the different situations involved and the various approaches taken to this integration. On the international scene  Kyrgyzstan will act as peace-loving  neutral  non-nuclear State. As such  our Republic is ready to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to tackle other issues related to the strengthening of strategic and military security. Our meeting takes place at a crucial turning point for the United Nations. The process of searching for the most adequate and appropriate principles for the Organization  in keeping with the new  changing realities of a post-confrontation world  is now under way. Distortions caused by totalitarianism in the sphere of interstate and interethnic relations have led to emergence of crisis zones in the vast area stretching from the former Yugoslavia to Central Asia. We support the ideas put forward in the report of the Secretary-General  ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. We believe that in order to prevent and settle conflicts  it is necessary to apply within the framework of international law all existing mechanisms of the United Nations and the CSCE. The main thing is the timeliness and adequacy of the steps undertaken. Preventive diplomacy and timely reaction should be given top priority in all peace-keeping efforts. We are especially concerned over maintaining stability in Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan advocates constructive steps and a regional orientation for maintaining peace and stability in the region. In this connection  we were greatly interested by a proposal for organizing a forum on interaction and confidence in Asia similar to the all-European process put forward yesterday by the President of Kazakhstan  Nursultan Mazarbayev  in his speech to the General Assembly. This forum  as we see it  could help to adapt to Asian realities the vast experience accumulated by world and European organizations in confidence-building measures and mechanisms for collective security. Kyrgyzstan is now passing through a harsh economic crisis  the reasons for which are evident and well-known. The situation has been aggravated by natural disasters. On two occasions this year an earthquake and a flood have led to the loss of human lives and caused enormous material damage. Obviously  it would be difficult for us to overcome all the problems of the transitional period by ourselves. It is therefore difficult to overestimate the importance of the economic  financial  technical and humanitarian assistance provided us by the world community. The cooperation of the United Nations and its specialized agencies with a large group of countries that became full-fledged members only recently is especially valuable both from the standpoint of solving their problems and with respect to reforms under way in the Organization. In general terms  this relates to the effectiveness of the United Nations and of its system. We appreciate the activities of the United Nations specialized agencies  which  through an adequate assessment of our status and situation  are active in setting up programmes in our country. The upcoming opening in Bishkek of a United Nations representative office will promote the speedy integration of Kyrgyzstan into international economic  technical  scientific and humanitarian cooperation. Our Republic became a United Nations member at a time of renewal and reforms. We are in favour of practical steps aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of this Organization as the key factor in establishing a new world order. I take this opportunity to confirm that Kyrgyzstan will adhere strictly to the provisions of the Charter and will make its contribution to the activities of the Organization. "
"86",3805,"KNA",47,1992,"I bring heartfelt greetings from the Government and friendly people of Saint Kitts and Nevis  and I am particularly pleased and  indeed  honoured to be called upon to address the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. Let me first join those speakers who have preceded me in congratulating the former President  Mr. Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  on his efficient and proficient handling of our past deliberations. Then I must hasten to welcome our new President  assuring you  Sir  of my country's active support and cooperation. Clearly  Mr. President  the very skilful and methodical manner in which you have been guiding and conducting our work augurs well for a productive session. Next I wish to commend most highly our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has been serving the cause of our Organization with diligence  dignity and dexterity in the face of challenging times. The Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis welcome you  Mr. Secretary-General  to this  your first session of the General Assembly as Secretary-General  and we have every confidence in your commitment to international peace and security as the bases for democracy and development. When we met last year for the Assembly's forty-sixth session it was in an atmosphere of great optimism. The cold war was over  Kuwait was liberated  freedom and democracy were breaking out all over Europe and in the former Soviet States  positive steps for the reduction of nuclear arms were taking place. The world waited with anticipation to reap the benefits of the all-embracing peace dividend. In my address then I said: ""The enhancement of education  the eradication of poverty  the reduction of unemployment  the maintenance of good health  the provision of affordable housing  the adapting of science and technology to socio-economic development these must be the dividends that flow from diverting global financial resources away from the amassing of armaments  to be invested in human development. This is the challenge we face. This is the new battle we must join and we must not fail."" (A/46/PV.25. p. 6) It is perhaps too soon to say that we have failed  but we have certainly not succeeded. Once again  the attention of the international community has been distracted by fierce and despicable atrocities in far-flung theatres of regional conflict. On the one hand  we are shocked by the gruesome and intense savagery of the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The reports of detention camp atrocities  indiscriminate killings  starvation and torture  seem like a reincarnation of less civilized times  and it is difficult to accept them as part of the twentieth century. On the other hand  the scenes of human degradation  suffering and death from starvation and disease emanating from Somalia appear at last to have jolted the conscience of the international community and stimulated a humanitarian response to the crisis. In these theatres of civil strife  our relief efforts are disrupted by those who are seemingly untouched by human suffering. Relief convoys come under fire  and food intended for the victims of war is hijacked and ends up in the coffers of those whose very actions are perpetuating the crisis. I am aware of the outstanding efforts of the Secretary-General to ensure that the United Nations has responded to these crises with urgency and in positive and practical ways. We must however do more. We must mobilize the resources  diplomatic and other  of the Member States to bring an end to the fighting and  secondly  we must continue to intensify the relief effort for those in need of the basic necessities of food  shelter and medicines. It is serious cause for concern that countries in which the economy is in shambles  and in which production of goods and services is practically at a standstill  can still find the means to procure massive amounts of arms and ammunition and sustain armed conflicts for many months and even years. Here again we see resources that should be channelled to address issues of human development being diverted into weapons of destruction for the perpetration of violence. It is therefore clear that there is also an urgent need for a reduction in both conventional and non-conventional weapons and I call upon the Assembly to pursue this objective. While much of our attention seems to be directed towards Eastern Europe let us be reminded that peace and development continue to elude the people of Haiti and South Africa. The people of Haiti still cannot breathe the pure air of freedom; they still suffer under an oppressive illegal regime which blatantly and monstrously repudiated the will of the people  which was so freely and overwhelmingly expressed in the elections of December 1990. Saint Kitts and Nevis  and indeed the entire Caribbean community  continue to condemn this dastardly assault upon the democratic process in Haiti  and we maintain our call for the restoration of constitutional democracy in Haiti. I call on the Member States of the United Nations to ostracize the illegal regime in Haiti and to take all appropriate measures to restore democracy and the constitutionally elected government in Haiti. In the meantime we must continue and increase humanitarian assistance to the people of Haiti through international relief organizations  and ensure that our assistance reaches those who need it most. We must also be prepared to mobilize significant development assistance to Haiti when democracy is restored. In relation to South Africa  we in the Caribbean have been strong in our condemnation of apartheid. I have no doubt that our principled stand  along with that of other countries has contributed to the eventual dismantling of the main pillars of apartheid. Encouraged by the African National Congress  and as a means of encouraging further progress  we relaxed some of the sanctions that we had imposed. The recent upsurge in violence  which appears to enjoy tacit support from elements within the ruling regime itself  must cause us to doubt the sincerity of the De Klerk administration to lay apartheid in its final resting place. The Government and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis call upon the General Assembly at this forty-seventh session to condemn the wanton killings in South Africa and to appeal to all parties to resume talks in good faith  for the sake of democracy and good government. We call for an end to the violence in South Africa. We urge the immediate resumption of the negotiating process towards a free and democratic South Africa. We re-emphasize our unshakable solidarity with the anti-apartheid struggle and we appeal to the South African regime to exercise more effective control over its security forces. The climate for negotiation has to be restored in order to facilitate the emergence and subsequent establishment of a democratic and non-racial South Africa. We seize this opportunity to invite the international community  if necessary  to remobilize its forces in the struggle against apartheid  in the struggle for freedom  peace and democracy in South Africa. Let us not abandon the oppressed people in South Africa. Let us stand firm instead until justice  equality and freedom become realities. The primary objective must be ""one person  one vote"". This is the only brand of democracy we in the Caribbean understand. This is the only brand of democracy we want for ourselves and for our brothers and sisters in South Africa. We commend the role the United Nations has played and continues to play in respect of Arab-Israeli relations. We regard the peace talks that have started as a positive development and we urge that they be continued in good faith by all parties concerned  so that a just and lasting solution which addresses all of the issues of fundamental rights  security and economic and social development can be achieved. The people in developing countries are still anxiously awaiting the ""peace dividend"". This body of nations must work assiduously at bringing an end to conflicts  at ending hunger and starvation. We must  in short  strive to move beyond a mere crisis-response modality and shift into a posture to effect just and sustainable development throughout the world. It is a monumental task  which will require massive mobilization of resources  sensible and sensitive application of those resources  and an unprecedented level of cooperation between developed and developing countries. There must be a major emphasis on human resource development so that the people may be empowered to drive the development process. In this decade of the disabled  and beyond  they too must be involved. My Government is making every effort to ensure that the disabled of our country are involved in the total process of mobilization. In order to increase public awareness and to assist in the development of the disabled  my Government has spearheaded a major fund-raising effort through the annual walkathon undertaken by Ministers of Government as part of our celebration of independence. We also support training programmes through our own school for the deaf and private sector support institutions.  The people must be given the tools education  basic infrastructure  appropriate technology transfer and the life-quality-enhancing support of affordable housing  good health care and facilities for recreation. Instead of a massive mobilization of financial resources for developing countries  however  we are faced with reductions in concessional financing and across-the-board cuts in aid. These will hit the poorest and smallest countries hardest and undermine our efforts to reduce poverty  stimulate growth and protect the environment. Free trade is being touted as the new panacea for all our ills. There is  however  no single prescription for the economic ailments of all countries. There is no one solution for the rich and the poor  for the industrialized and the non-industrialized  for the developed and the developing. Even within the category of developing countries  there are structural differences between small island developing countries and others. Special consideration must therefore be given to small island developing countries. In matters of trade we cannot be equal partners. How can we  when large countries  having the benefit of economies of scale  highly developed infrastructure and modern technology  can swamp our markets with virtually any product? On the other hand  the per capita cost to us of providing the infrastructure to support an export-oriented development is higher than it is in developed countries. In the Caribbean we recognize that we must accept the principal responsibility for progress in our own development. We have demonstrated a commitment to reform and diversification  we have taken bold initiatives involving greater fiscal and economic discipline  and we are willing to do more. But we cannot do the job alone. We have made significant progress in regional cooperation and are now poised to take further initiatives to strengthen our functional  economic and political cooperation. We know that we can do more for ourselves through more effective regional integration. As a Caribbean people  we have to be realistic in assessing the potential impact of our regional integration process. The members of the international community too must be realistic in designing their policies for interacting with us in the Caribbean community. The fact is that  as developing countries most of us being island developing countries in the Caribbean community we are individually small. When taken together and looked at in the international context  we are still small  and the basic problems  inequities and vulnerabilities of small developing countries still afflict us. We want to play an effective part in the international economic system; we want to be equal partners in the evolving global trading arrangements. In our case  however  equal does not mean identical  because we do not start from the same premise. The basic conditions and inequities which necessitated special arrangements under agreements such as the Lome Convention  the Caribbean Basin Initiative and CARIBCAN are still present. Therefore  while we support the call for an early and successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations  we urge that as we  the small island developing countries of the Caribbean  work assiduously to transform our economies  earnest consideration should be given to the continuation of preferential trading arrangements to small countries such as ours. In particular  special treatment of the sensitive commodities  sugar and bananas  is vital to our stable adjustment to the changing global economic environment. The other area for urgent action is the maintenance of concessional flows of aid to developing countries. I am aware that global recession and the recent uncertainties reflected in the financial system in Europe will put severe pressures on donor budgets and will thus encourage the trend towards the reduction of official development assistance. I must  in spite of the difficulties  renew the call for developed countries to recommit themselves to reaching the United Nations target for official development assistance amounting to 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product. A reduction in aid would undermine our efforts to promote sustainable development and protect the environment. Yet those objectives were the very heart of the consensus reached at the historic United Nations Conference on Environment and Development the Earth Summit held at Rio de Janeiro in June of this year. That conference provided us with a rare  almost unique  opportunity for global cooperation and partnership. We paused there to chart afresh the course for improving the quality of life for all peoples in our time and for future generations  through an integrated  caring and people-oriented approach to sustainable development. We left there with a clear commitment to balance the urgency of environmental preservation with the imperatives of human development. We signed the Convention on biological diversity to encourage the rational management of natural resources  to ensure that the people of developing countries will justly gain the benefits associated with the use of their resources. We also signed the Convention on climate change  because Saint Kitts and Nevis  and indeed the entire Caribbean region  are susceptible to the ravages of hurricanes  and  as island States  we are certainly vulnerable to the effects of global warming and a rise in sea level. The execution of those Conventions must have special meaning to our women and children. The United Nations has already committed itself to devoting special attention to them. Saint Kitts and Nevis fully acknowledges the importance and contribution of our women to sustainable development. Women in my country are fully involved as equal partners in the decision-making and development processes. The rights of women and the entitlement to such rights have been integrated into my country's development policies and programmes  which are implemented by a Ministry of Women's Affairs. We recognize the strong correlation between environmentally sound development and population growth  and we provide family-planning programmes involving education  information and accessible services. We maintain our commitment to our children through the provision of improved educational facilities and appropriate curricula  a variety of training opportunities  recreational facilities  improved housing and a strong programme of primary health care in which we maintain our standard of 100 per cent immunization against the common communicable diseases. The importance of our marine environment to the health  welfare and total development of our Caribbean people cannot be overemphasized. Consequently reports of the impending shipment of a large quantity of plutonium through the Caribbean Sea later this month are a matter of the gravest concern to us in Saint Kitts and Nevis. This is a matter which must and will be addressed by the Caribbean community. I call on the international community to support us in our efforts to protect our marine environment and to prohibit the movement of hazardous waste through our region. We in Saint Kitts and Nevis will continue to play our part in preserving our planet by implementing national policies and programmes based on domestic social and economic realities  including solid waste management  water quality improvement  control of soil and coastal erosion  forestry management  agricultural and fisheries development and preservation of our marine environment. In Rio  we endorsed an implementation programme known as Agenda 21. It addresses the major issues related to sustainable development. It charts the way to improved living standards in developing countries. We must now translate this blueprint into tangible action by providing the financial resources for its implementation. Within the programme  access to the resources must not be tied to conditions that would impose further burdens on the people of developing countries. Such resources must be made available on preferential terms  with special concessions for small island developing countries. I can stress the urgency of this requirement in no better way than to repeat what I said to the historic assembly in Rio: ""We cannot aspire to save the planet for future generations  while consigning the poor  the underprivileged  the underdeveloped of this generation to a life of persistent misery and deprivation."" The task *is enormous  the challenge is monumental  but within the international community we have the tools. All that is left is for us to summon the commitment to preserve  develop and manage our combined heritage with the objective of guaranteeing a better quality of life for all people  everywhere. "
"87",3831,"KOR",47,1992,"I should like to extend my congratulations to you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am confident that under your able leadership the Assembly will be highly productive. I pay my respects also to the Secretary-General for his dedicated efforts to promote world peace - the primary objective of this body. His experience and sagacity have so strengthened the Organization that it has been able to meet effectively the new and varied challenges of this rapidly changing world. I take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to those nations that became Members of the United Nations since the last session of the General Assembly. Today the world is beginning a new chapter in history. As I stand at this rostrum for the third time since 1988  I cannot but recall the profound and comprehensive transformations the world has undergone over the past four years. The global confrontation over ideologies is rapidly disappearing as dictatorial and authoritarian Governments crumble in succession. Instead  we are witnessing the birth of freedom  equality and respect for human dignity and individual creativity. This epic transformation is neither a victory for any one country nor a triumph of any group of nations; it is a victory for all of us living in this historic era. Peace and prosperity are no longer distant dreams; they now stand as realistic goals within our reach  for magnificent and inexorable waves of freedom and openness are sweeping across the world. Human endeavour towards peace and prosperity continues today. From Eastern Europe to the Cape of Good Hope  and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific shores  we witness solid progress towards a more harmonious and prosperous world. Not only have the United States and Russia begun all-out reductions of nuclear weapons  but regional disputes too are being resolved  one after another. Through the efforts of the United Nations  the 12 years of internecine strife in El Salvador have ended  and Cambodia is in the process of regaining peace and stability. Today United Nations peace-keeping efforts are becoming more effective everywhere. However  violence and the illegal use of force persist  even in this age of reconciliation and cooperation. The situation in Iraq  the dispute in South Africa  the famine in Somalia - these and other problems are evidence that before we celebrate the arrival of an age of peace we must marshall greater efforts to prevent undue suffering and misery. Watching the tragic bloodshed in the former Yugoslavia  I could not but feel that a long and tortuous road remained before we could secure lasting peace in our world. The Republic of Korea extends encouragement and support to the United Nations Protection Force for its courageous activities  under extremely adverse conditions  to maintain peace and provide humanitarian relief and assistance in the former Yugoslav region. We also strongly support the diplomatic efforts of the United Nations and the European Community towards an early resolution of this dispute. We are well aware of the many invaluable contributions the United Nations has made in the fields of peace-keeping  refugee relief and related humanitarian causes. I sincerely hope that the tragic situation in that region will be resolved quickly and that the role of the United Nations will be further strengthened. Today the world is becoming a larger whole capable of transcending confrontations and rivalries. A new world order is emerging on the basis of law and morality rather than in terms of power. The United Nations has worked for half a century  and the time is now opportune  to foster harmony and cooperation between nations. We must seize this moment to forge a new international order so that a permanent peace structure may be secured. The United Nations should play a central role in our efforts to attain this cherished goal  because this body is the one just arbiter and the forum where disputes may be resolved through dialogue and compromise. Speaking from this rostrum last year  I emphasized that the United Nations should redouble its efforts to prevent regional disputes and to strengthen further the collective security measures to prevent the illegal use of force. For these reasons I believe that the ""Agenda for Peace"" recently submitted by the Secretary-General is very timely and meaningful in promoting our common cause. This Agenda is a very forward-looking and substantive proposition  which will definitely strengthen the role of the United Nations in all areas of world peace and security  including preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-building. I sincerely hope that the members of this body at the General Assembly during the course of this session and in related organs - will seriously consider the proposals contained in the Agenda so that consensus may emerge within the international community. The Republic of Korea will faithfully and actively participate in all United Nations endeavours to maintain world peace and security and to safeguard the future of mankind. A new international order demands a new concept of international security. The era in which security was based on military power and on weapons of mass destruction has passed. Recently the United States and Russia agreed to destroy all ground-launched ballistic missiles within the next 10 years and to reduce drastically the number of nuclear warheads.  I wholeheartedly welcome this decision and hope that it will serve as the impetus for accelerated reduction of nuclear arsenals throughout the world. Today one of the most destabilizing trends in the field of international security is the rapid spread of nuclear and sophisticated conventional weapons to existing areas of dispute and potential regions of conflict. My Government places great importance on the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and fully endorses the strengthening of the proposed nuclear safeguard measures by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Furthermore  we will wholeheartedly support the extension of the Treaty in 1995. My Government welcomes the draft Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons  which the Geneva Conference on Disarmament successfully negotiated. I hope Member States will unanimously approve this important treaty at this session; my Government will accede to the Convention without delay. As the Secretary-General pointed out in his report  we face a number of critical challenges  such as the eradication of starvation and world poverty  the plight of refugees  respect for human rights and the protection of the environment. Emancipation from the yoke of poverty and underdevelopment is an urgent issue that we must resolve for the lasting peace and prosperity of mankind. We can speak of peace and prosperity only after we successfully eliminate such fundamental threats to human life as poverty  hunger  disease and underdevelopment. To the starved and wretched  justice sounds hollow. To the sick and disaffected  peace is meaningless. Just as ardent aspirations to freedom and prosperity ended the cold war  we must now combine our efforts to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment.  Today  although the East-West confrontation has ended  the gap between North and South is widening by the day. What is most needed to mitigate this disparity is a concerted effort between the advanced and developing countries. For their part  developing countries should concentrate greater efforts on economic development and the improvement of their standards of living. In efforts to eliminate poverty from underdeveloped regions and to improve living standards there  advanced countries should provide succour in the forms of economic aid  investment and the transfer of technology on an active and continuing basis. We can surmount these challenges if we all agree that there is but one world community  of which all of us are a part. The Korean people inherited generations of chronic poverty. What little remained on their land was reduced to ashes in the course of the Korean War  the most violent conflagration of the post-war period. Rising from the destruction of war  we have built within a generation an economy that ranks among the dozen largest trading nations in the world. Our country is not endowed with rich natural resources  and we have carried a heavy defence burden. We stand prepared to share this experience with the developing world and those countries under fundamental reforms. We distinctly remember the miseries of poverty and underdevelopment and the generous assistance and cooperation we received from advanced countries. We will act as a bridge between North and South by sharing information and know-how and by promoting exchange and cooperation. Korea will actively participate in  and make contributions commensurate with its ability to  the effective resolution of the North-South problem. The natural environment is not ours to abuse. It not only represents our past  but also foreshadows our future. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development last June will be recognized as a new beginning in the preservation of our environment. Having reconfirmed the fact that our Planet Earth is the very source of life not only for our generation but for posterity as well  the world community agreed on a plan of action to protect our environment at the global level. I sincerely hope that all countries will take the necessary steps domestically and cooperate in implementing measures internationally in the spirit of the Rio Declaration and the Rio Conference. Environmental preservation and economic development should no longer be treated as mutually exclusive goals  but as complementary objectives. However  it would not be fair to impose unreasonable environmental restrictions on those developing countries that began industrialization belatedly due to chronic poverty  underdevelopment and the lack of sufficient resources. A new path toward a century of peace and prosperity should not be designed at the expense of the developing world. Environmental protection has now become a national objective of my country. Last June Korea adopted for the first time a National Charter for the Environment  and we set up a special intragovernmental coordinating body to oversee environmental policy implementation. The United Nations is a most effective organization for solving such global issues as environmental protection. Korea will actively participate and undertake appropriate roles in all United Nations efforts toward this end. Systematic human-rights violations persist even as the waves of freedom and the rights of individuals sweep across the world. The violation of fundamental human rights cannot be justified under any pretext. The protection of these rights is our collective responsibility. International relief and assistance efforts should be strengthened to protect refugees from war and internecine strife as well as from poverty. The protection of minorities is a human-rights issue directly linked not only to the stability of the countries concerned  but also to world peace. Consequently  all Member States must observe their obligations faithfully. The Republic of Korea extends full support to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights. I hope it will serve as a momentous occasion for strengthening an international system for the protection of human rights. The winds of reconciliation and cooperation that swept across the Eurasian continent are now blowing over North-East Asia. I am pleased to report that the Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China normalized relations last month. As a result  the cold-war rigidities that kept North-East Asia frozen for the past 47 years have finally begun to melt away. This is a significant step towards alleviating the agony of the tragic fratricidal war in Korea. The vigorous pursuit of a Northern Policy to bring lasting peace to the Korean peninsula has returned a favorable response. During the past four and a half years Korea established diplomatic relations with 39 countries  for a total of 165 countries. Diplomatic relations between Korea and China and my official visit to Beijing next week are expected to contribute to reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and to peace-making efforts in North-East Asia. North-East Asia has thus begun the march towards a new era of lasting peace and common prosperity. Speaking to the Assembly from this very rostrum four years ago  I mentioned the desirability of a consultative conference for peace in North-East Asia. I note that many hurdles still stand in the way of the realization of such a proposal. Times are changing  however. Depending on our determination  we can turn such ideas into reality. In the highly sensitive region of North-East Asia  which has seen five major wars in the past 100 years  efforts to build a structure of lasting peace are very desirable for both regional stability and world peace. Therefore  I hope an opportunity for dialogue between all interested parties will be found for the purposes of building trust and promoting mutual understanding  confidence and common prosperity. Once mutual understanding and a forum of cooperation are established  I believe that we can realistically expect the emergence of a new order of peace in North-East Asia. Two years ago dialogue between the Prime Ministers of the two Koreas was initiated. Thus far  eight rounds of meetings have been held alternately in Seoul and Pyongyang  and a number of issues have been discussed. Late last year  the two Koreas adopted an ""Agreement on Reconciliation  Non-aggression  and Exchanges and Cooperation between the South and the North"" and a ""Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" Both documents came into effect in February of this year. We were filled with a sense of anticipation. For an ethnically homogeneous people that has spent the past 47 years in confrontation  this was a dramatic achievement. However  we have yet to see the implementation of the specific measures agreed upon by the two sides. The reality on the Korean Peninsula is that humanitarian projects  including the exchange of visits by separated family members  remain unrealized. The terms of the ""Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" called for the two Koreas to conduct mutual nuclear inspections by last June. But this measure also has yet to be carried out. I must point out that mutual nuclear inspections are the most serious obstacle on the path towards further progress in inter-Korean relations. North Korea's suspected nuclear development is casting dark clouds over the future of the Korean Peninsula. It is becoming a new factor threatening peace in North-East Asia and the world at large. As members are well aware  reconciliation  cooperation  openness and the creation of a new order of peace are clearly the current global trends. I sincerely hope that North Korea will be able to improve its relations with other countries. Participation in all regional cooperative bodies and a partnership with their southern brethren towards a new order of peace and common prosperity are what all my countrymen wish for North Korea. Where there is suspicion  however  there can hardly be true friendship. As a Member of the United Nations  North Korea is responsible for allaying all suspicions surrounding its nuclear development and thereby being accepted by the community of nations. At this very hour some 1.7 million heavily armed soldiers stand alert along a line dividing the Korean Peninsula. I find it difficult to explain why brothers should aim rifles at each other day and night in an atmosphere of anxiety and tension. But I have faith faith that our people will be reunited. The 47 painful years we have lived apart is but a brief moment for a people that has lived together as one nation for over five millennia. We will not be impetuous  nor will we be frustrated. With patience  we will continue to foster dialogue  exchange  and cooperation with North Korea. On our own  we can and will open a wide avenue of exchange and join hands in cooperation. And in the near future we should recover mutual trust on the basis of our common heritage and achieve the historic task of peaceful reunification. The Korean people is confident that it has transformed yesterday's despair into tomorrow's hope. In this endeavour we acknowledge the friendly support and cooperation offered by the United Nations and the international community  for which we shall be forever grateful. If Korea has achieved any miracle in recent years  that miracle belongs not only to the Korean people  but also to the community of nations represented in this Hall. This experience has nurtured our confidence that we can meet the challenges ahead. The task now before the Korean people is peaceful national unification. Recent history dictates that freedom and independence await the subjugated and that reunification awaits the divided. Only when the last scar of the cold war that which divides the Korean peninsula - disappears from the map will the world be able to close the historic chapter of the cold-war era. Last year I concluded my address with the following commitment: ""Henceforth  the Republic of Korea will play a leading role in building a world that will be a blessing to our posterity a world that will be freer  safer and happier; above all  a world of peace."" (A/46/PV.6. pp. 39-40) Today I reconfirm my resolve. Just as the divided Korean Peninsula was a focal point of tension and confrontation in North-East Asia  a unified Korea will serve as a fountainhead of peace and prosperity for that region. Today we have a most propitious opportunity to realize the founding ideals of the United Nations envisaged half a century ago. What is needed is a united will to cooperate and make the necessary sacrifices. This is posterity's demand upon our generation and history's command to our era. To build a more peaceful and prosperous twenty-first century is to realize the ideals of the United Nations and the security and well-being of all mankind. As I leave this rostrum  I foresee that a reunified Korea will usher in a peaceful and prosperous twenty-first century and that  when the first Head of State of a unified Korea finally stands before the General Assembly  its members will join as one with the Korean people in applauding that momentous occasion. "
"88",3877,"KWT",47,1992,"On behalf of the delegation of the State of Kuwait  I wish to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your election. Sir  reflects an appreciation of your country  Bulgaria  and your personal merits and skills  which will prove instrumental in guiding our deliberations towards the attainment of our common goals. On a bilateral note  it is my privilege to underscore the close ties that exist between our two countries  as shown in numerous concrete steps. In your current post  you succeed His Excellency Ambassador Samir Shihabi  the Permanent Representative of our sister country  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  who demonstrated outstanding skills and capabilities in his stewardship of the preceding session. His leadership was effective indeed throughout his term of office. This was no surprise to us  especially as Mr. Shihabi represented a sister country  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  which has made and continues to make generous and sincere contributions  that are appreciated by all  to the promotion of peace and security throughout the world. It gives me special pleasure to commend the outstanding role played by the Secretary-General of the United Nations  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  since his assumption of his office at the beginning of this year. The world Organization has now become the true focal point of international relations and the beacon of hope for the peoples of the world. In less than one year in office  the Secretary-General has demonstrated an impressive ability to face up to the evolving challenges on the world scene  and has managed to address the varying concerns in accordance with the established principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the overall mission of our organization. The Secretary-General's endeavour to redefine the role  function and orientation of the United Nations is characterized by precise thinking and clear vision  resolve and flexibility  both in concept and in enforcement plan  as demonstrated by the set of important recommendations contained in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"". In his approach  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has proved that he truly represents a symbol of the interface and interaction of various human civilizations  a role that his home country  Egypt  has played throughout its long history. In the same vein  we should not fail to underscore with a deep sense of appreciation the great achievements of the former Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  during his tenure. Mr. Perez de Cuellar should be recognized for his integrity in fulfilling his mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Charter and for his untiring efforts to promote peace on the basis of justice and to enhance the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. Kuwait recognizes with deep appreciation those achievements  salutes Mr. Perez de Cuellar and wishes him success in all he does. The international scene has undergone fundamental changes over the past two years  the most significant of which has been the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the spread of democratic orientation across Eastern Europe. That  in turn has led to the creation of States and entities that have joined the United Nations membership  thus consolidating further its universality. Kuwait takes this opportunity to extend its sincere congratulations to all those States that have been admitted recently to the United Nations membership. We trust that this new membership of the international community will represent a constructive addition to and consolidation of the edifice of world peace. As we draw nearer to the twenty-first century  we look forward to the emergence of new roles for the United Nations. The United Nations should not be content with peace-keeping  the ending wars that have broken out  and the defusing of volatile situations. Rather  the United Nations must make a more direct contribution to the containment and defusing of disputes in their early stages before they erupt into vicious conflicts. It must also shoulder the role of peacemaking. The United Nations should not be content with ensuring stability  despite the vital importance of that role. It must be a force for ensuring peoples' welfare and the fulfilment of peoples' aspirations. In today's world  the concept of peace transcends the framework of peace between states and embraces the peace of whole societies and peoples. As we work together on the formulation of the new world order and strive to make it one of the principal stanchions of the stability which we hope will reign in our world and imbue international relations  we are called upon to ensure the rule of international law through the strengthening of the United Nations role and the scrupulous application of its Charter. In our view  this will provide a genuine framework for the new world order and for the achievement of its lofty goals. Despite the fact that international relations in our world today are anchored in the tenets of the United Nations system  we believe that an effective and viable United Nations should be complemented by a more aggressive role for the regional organizations which would be instrumental in addressing many unresolved disputes and issues. The League of Arab States and the Organization of African Unity  for example  should be entrusted with supporting roles in dealing with the problems of Somalia; the European Community should play the leading role in the resolution of the escalating problems in the Balkan region; and the Organization of American States can become the leading player in dealing with the problems of Haiti and El Salvador. In the context of this desired role for regional organizations the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) stands out  especially through its firm support of Kuwait's struggle to defeat the Iraqi aggression. That unprecedented role of the GCC could perhaps be followed as a model in rallying a larger international effort when necessary. Kuwait believes that the Non-Aligned Movement  especially in the wake of its recent summit in Jakarta  and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  as well as the Group of 77  are models of regional organizations whose capabilities should be directed at facilitating the evolution and maintenance of world peace. In this sense  they are natural mini-counterparts of the United Nations  and they represent major dynamic forces that perform a coordinating function among their members. From this perspective we believe that the efforts undertaken by the United Nations in the liberation of my country  Kuwait  from the Iraqi aggression and occupation could perhaps be perceived as a new approach in the crystallization and enforcement of the concept of collective security  which preoccupied this world body since its inception  and was a hope in the minds of the authors of its Charter. Thus  the Kuwait case established a precedent when it demonstrated that the Security Council's resolutions can be implemented  as  indeed  they must be implemented. The Security Council has clearly succeeded in consolidating the underpinnings of peace and the elimination of many hotbeds of conflict in several regions of the world  in the aftermath of its successful moves to ensure the liberation of my country  Kuwait  from an invasion which  by its very nature  represented a challenge to the Charter of the United Nations and to the norms of international law that regulate relations between civilized nations. However  certain residual results of the Iraqi aggression still exist  and will continue to exist so long as the Iraqi regime persists in its refusal to comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions and tries to circumvent those resolutions and to renege on its previous formal commitments. For instance  there are still Kuwaiti and third country prisoners held hostage in Iraqi jails despite the intensive efforts and international pressures deployed to secure their release. Furthermore  the patently false claims repeatedly made by Iraq  in contravention of international treaties and commitments  continue to shake the parameters of stability throughout the region. Iraqi falsehoods also jeopardize the main objective of the input of the United Nations in providing the technical framework for the Iraq-Kuwait boundary demarcation process. This exercise is a major achievement on the part of the United Nations in regard to security and stability in the region. The Security Council's recently adopted resolution 773 (1992) welcomed the decisions of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission and underlined the Council's guarantee of inviolability of the international border between the two countries and its decision to take  as appropriate  all necessary measures to that end  in accordance with the Charter. Furthermore  Iraq continues to refuse to accept legal responsibility for its plundering of property owned by the Kuwaiti private sector and by Kuwaiti individuals  and continues to refuse to recognize the need to return all stolen property. Iraq also refuses to implement Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991) regarding the provision of essential humanitarian needs for the Iraqi civilian population and the payment of its dues to the United Nations compensation fund. In addition  Iraq  under all pretexts  shies away from any businesslike cooperation in regard to the fulfilment of its obligation to disclose all its stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and in regard to the elimination of such weapons. All of this places a new responsibility on the international community in general to bring further pressure to bear on Iraq  to remain vigilant to its practices and schemes  and to ensure its complete implementation of all the relevant United Nations resolutions. The principle of collective responsibility still stands  and the lessons drawn from that painful and bitter experience should be fully understood and never forgotten. Kuwait believes that security in the Gulf region is part and parcel of world security. This means that it is essential that all of us respect the sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity of all the States in our region. It also means non-interference in the internal affairs of those States  as well as the non-use of force or of the threat of force in the settlement of any dispute that may arise between them. From this premise  we have been following with grave concern the recent developments  with all their ramifications  in regard to the Abu Mousa island. In our view  these developments will have a direct impact on regional peace and stability. Hence  we are all duty-bound to work towards averting their repercussions so that the good-neighbourly relations that we already have with the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran may be preserved. While we declare our full support for our sister State of the United Arab Emirates  we hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will abide by the agreement regarding the island of Abu Mousa and will accept the application of international conventions for the peaceful resolution of disputes. We trust that  in the final analysis  prudence and wisdom will reign supreme in regard to this issue. As of late last year  we have seen a promising peace process under way in regard to the Middle East problem. The new realities and momentum that emerged following the Madrid conference should be maintained  with a view to securing the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) on the basis of the exchange of land for peace. It has become clear that land and peace are worth any price. The international community has thus a special responsibility to nurture the ongoing peace efforts and to ensure that the current peace talks  in all their aspects and forms  will bring to fruition the efforts that the United Nations has made with a view to guaranteeing the national rights of the Palestinian people particularly its right to self-determination and statehood - and the complete withdrawal of Israel from the West Bank  the Gaza Strip and the holy city of Al-Quds. We call upon the United Nations to prompt Israel to abide expeditiously with its obligations under international law and not to squander this historic opportunity. The peace process and the attendant efforts should follow an integrated approach in addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict that takes into account the United Nations resolutions regarding the question of Palestine and the Middle East issue. In specific terms  this means that Israel must withdraw from southern Lebanon in accordance with Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  and that the Lebanese people must be supported in consolidating their national-reconciliation efforts and in rebuilding their national institutions. It also means Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Arab Golan and the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions in order that a just and lasting settlement of this long-running conflict may be reached. The ongoing plight of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina gives rise to deep fears and apprehensions throughout the Islamic world and in the world at large. We categorically reject all practices that aim at the liquidation of the identity and existence of a people  a nation and a State on ethnic or religious grounds. We support the struggle of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and demand the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. We call upon the United Nations  along with its specialized agencies  to expand its role there  and we hold that regional organizations  particularly the European ones  should play a more active role in alleviating the suffering of that people. It is our collective responsibility to contain the ramifications of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina before they spill over into neighbouring countries. If the United Nations has been seized of this tragic issue since the very beginning  then we believe that there are other turbulent areas in the world that deserve active involvement on the part of the United Nations together with the competent regional organizations  with a view to containing and resolving the disputes afflicting those regions. In our view  this is a sound approach to underlining and enhancing the credibility of the United Nations and to defining clearly the parameters of the new world order. We are duty-bound to support both the United Nations and the regional organizations in a concrete fashion that gives real meaning to the concept of common security and stability and the principle of common destiny. The tragedy of the Somali people is cause for deep concern on our part  given the common values we share with them. The fratricidal strife in Somalia is extremely painful to us. Despite the slight improvement over the past few weeks in the delivery of food and medical supplies and in the control over the distribution thereof  Somalia continues to bleed  and it has now become incumbent upon all nations to provide more material assistance to Somalia and to strengthen their support for the Secretary-General in his endeavours to expedite the attainment of a set of noble goals  namely  the protection of an entire people from annihilation and the delivery of adequate supplies of food and medical services to that people. We in Kuwait  in view of our solidarity with the friendly peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia and in line with our humanitarian obligations and our commitment to alleviate human suffering  have shipped thousands of tons of food  medical supplies and basic human needs to those two countries. Furthermore  we have made direct financial contributions to the relevant specialized agencies in order to ensure their ability to operate in those areas. We shall continue to provide humanitarian relief assistance out of our deep belief in social justice. We follow with deep concern the persistent instability in Afghanistan and the continuing strife among the partners in the coalition Government. We call upon the Muslim people of Afghanistan to put aside their differences and to move towards national reconciliation. National efforts should in fact focus on building up national stability and security. Any political breakthroughs made by the United Nations will add to its growing record of achievements. But such accomplishments will remain fragile unless followed by more efforts to promote social stability and economic development  with particular emphasis on health  social services and combating ills of epidemic proportions  especially drug abuse. Moreover  the United Nations should explore new avenues to ease the foreign debt burden on the developing countries and to try to bridge the gap between wealthy and poor nations by means of a more earnest and constructive dialogue between North and South  with a. view to ensuring economic equity anchored in social justice. One of the aims of such dialogue should be confidence-building between donor and recipient nations. Such confidence will lead to joint efforts in a bid to stimulate the inflow of investments with a better economic and social return for both sides. This will indeed be yet another manifestation of an interdependent world community of nations. It is against this conceptual backdrop that we view the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)  known as the ""Earth Summit""  held recently in Rio de Janiero. The focus of the Rio Conference brought to the fore the growing world-wide interest in gaining a better understanding of the political  economic  and social aspects of human life. Despite the fact that the UNCED did not achieve all its expected goals  one of its major contributions was that it highlighted for the whole world  in an unprecedented manner  the importance of the issue of environment and made it abundantly clear that ecological concerns do indeed transcend both national and regional disputes. It has deepened our sense of belonging to a single ""global village"". The current changes and new challenges on the international scene are bound to cause dramatic transformations in many established concepts and assumptions that still dominate international relations. A case in point is the growing interest in the issue of human rights. In an evolving world  not only should human rights be defined in instruments but the concept of human rights should be expanded to include the genuine guarantee of the exercise of those rights to freedoms and human dignity  in addition to the satisfaction of basic human needs and the liberation of man from fear and want. Guaranteeing human rights has become a major demand of today's world and the international community continues to make it clear  time and again  that it will not condone any breech or violation thereof. Respect for State sovereignty should be in consonance with the guaranteeing of human rights. In conclusion  we note that the recent radical  international changes have placed before the United Nations enormous challenges and responsibilities. The growing confidence in its role and in the need for it to perform its functions make it imperative for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to the world Organization. It would be both unfair and inappropriate for us to keep adding to its responsibilities without providing it with sufficient material and political support to enable it to fulfil its mandates effectively. This means that the international community should put at the United Nations disposal adequate resources and powers  commensurate with its responsibilities. The Secretary-General has shown that while the United Nations is prepared to discharge its functions  the Member States are in turn expected to honour their obligations in full. This complementarity between the United Nations system and its Members will straighten out the relationship between mandates and resources. Thus we can eliminate the imbalance between what is required and what is available and the potential causes of friction that go with that disequilibrium. Under such circumstances  the world body would be able to live up to the expectations of the international community in the areas of peacemaking and peace-keeping  along with all the attendant profits in terms of stability  security  development  progress and welfare."
"89",3923,"LAO",47,1992,"Mr. President  on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  I wish to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am convinced that you will brilliantly fulfil the important mission conferred upon you by the Assembly. I also wish to express sincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has assumed his office and high responsibilities at a time when the world situation requires that the United Nations play an important role. We cannot miss this opportunity to pay a special tribute to his predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  for his active contribution to the defence of our Organization's cause. We warmly welcome the presence among us of new Members: the Republic of Armenia  the Azerbaijani Republic  the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  the Republic of Croatia  the Republic of Georgia  the Republic of Kazakhstan  the Republic of Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  the Republic of San Marino  the Republic of Slovenia  the Republic of Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  and the Republic of Uzbekistan. Their admission is an important step towards the universality of our Organization. The global situation is in a state of profound change  both complex and full of new promise. With the breakup of the Eastern bloc  military and nuclear confrontation have progressively waned. None the less  numerous civil conflicts  ethnic struggles  religious clashes and border conflicts continue to disturb many countries of the world  thus seriously threatening international peace  stability and security. All of this notwithstanding  it must be noted that the world climate is evolving towards co-operation  development and the settlement of global problems  including those related to poverty  to misery and to the environment. In the changing world in which the new international order is beginning to take shape  the United Nations must play a central role in the collective effort to define this new order  which should respond equitably to the rights and interests of all countries and peoples without discrimination and must be based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and those of the United Nations Charter. It is therefore necessary to revitalize  restructure and democratize the United Nations if we want the Organization to be capable of the tasks that lie ahead in this new era. We are still in an uncertain world characterized by many problems and conflicts in different regions. In Europe  the situation prevailing in former Yugoslavia continues to deteriorate dangerously. It is a major source of concern for the international community  as well as a threat to regional and global peace and security. The international community must take appropriate measures to put an end to that ethnic conflict in order to restore peace  security and normal life to that part of the world. In South Africa  despite certain political reforms the foundations of the apartheid system remain intact. The Pretoria regime continues to resort to violence to repress the black population  while the African National Congress of South Africa (ANC) is forcefully and constructively pursuing its struggle for the triumph of its just cause. The Lao Government fully associates itself with the international community in its efforts to support the struggle of the great majority of that people in order to make South Africa a democratic and non-racial country. In the Middle East  the situation remains tense and precarious. Israel is perpetuating its occupation of Palestinian territory and of the other Arab territories. We reaffirm the view that every effort for peace now under way with a view to a just  comprehensive and lasting solution in the Middle East  at the heart of which is the question of Palestine  should work towards rapid implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the other resolutions of the United Nations calling for Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands  as well as recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. In the Persian Gulf  following the end of the war peace and security have not yet been established because of threats of and attempts at further hostilities.  In Western Asia  Afghanistan remains a theatre of civil war. The international community must appeal to all the parties concerned to put an immediate end to their conflicts in order to achieve national harmony among Afghans and to establish political  economic and social stability. In the Korean peninsula  the signing of the North-South Accord on Reconciliation  Non-Aggression and Exchanges and the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea has contributed to promoting mutual understanding and trust. It has opened up a new prospect for peace  stability and cooperation in the Korean peninsula and strengthened peace and security in the North-East Asian region and in the rest of the world. In the South-East Asian region  in spite of certain factors of instability  the situation as a whole is moving towards peace  stability  cooperation and development in the interest of the peoples of the entire region. In this context  inspired by the desire to strengthen relations of friendship and cooperation with neighbouring countries  the Lao Government  applying its consistent foreign policy based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence  signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with the Kingdom of Thailand  became a party to the Treaty of Bali of 1976. It has also become an Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) observer. It will continue to work firmly for fruitful cooperation in South-East Asia  with a view to promoting the progress and prosperity of the region  thus contributing to promoting peace and development the world over.  As regards the question of Cambodia  the signing of the Paris Agreements of 23 October 1991 laid the foundations for a comprehensive political settlement to the conflict  making it possible to put an end to the suffering endured by the Cambodian people during a long period of civil war and to establish peace and tranquillity in the noble land of Angkor. Complete compliance with  and implementation of  these Agreements is required to meet the aspirations and the interests of the Cambodian people. In my own country  the implementation of our policy of renewal has led to important successes. Political stability and social order are solidly guaranteed. Democracy and the right of collective decision-making by the people have developed steadily in accordance with our level of economic and social development and the customs of the country. The adoption last year by the National Assembly of the first Constitution of the Republic makes it possible for our country to move progressively towards a State of law. In the framework of that policy we are focusing all our efforts on freeing the country of underdevelopment. To this end we have encouraged foreign investment  intensified cooperation with other countries and taken advantage of all economic sectors employing market-economy mechanisms in order to tap all our national potential and to improve the physical and spiritual living conditions of our people. The world economy is in a state of uncertainty. Last year it experienced the first global recession since the 1940s. Moreover  the recovery remains weak and precarious. The developing countries continue to suffer from coercive economic policies and practices. The stifling burden of foreign debt  the decline in resources allocated to development  the deterioration of the terms of trade  the worsening of the outflow of capital  the drop in commodity prices  the rise in protectionism and limited access to modern technology all obstruct their economic progress at a time when reforms and readjustments are under way. Since the world economy is a single entity whose components are interdependent and interrelated  it is urgently necessary indeed  crucial to develop a new world consensus and to obtain a commitment to the strengthening of international cooperation  and in particular the revitalization of the economic growth and development of the developing countries  in order successfully to implement the economic strategy of the Fourth United Nations Development Decade  1991-2000. One of the most important issues related to development is that of the environment  which is at the forefront of our international concerns. Climate change  air  sea and ocean pollution  desertification and the depletion of the ozone layer have all had a negative impact on our lives and on the future of mankind. In this respect  we believe that the recent United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which was held in Rio de Janeiro  laid the foundations of international agreement on cooperation aimed at integrating the environment into all development activities. It will therefore be up to the United Nations and its specialized agencies to implement effectively Agenda 21. At the same time  the aspirations of the international community to a better quality of life and social progress have become more pressing and increasingly important. In fact  protection of the environment  promotion of economic growth and development  and the eradication of poverty are mutually reinforcing and require a new global partnership. In this framework  we are awaiting with interest the planned convening of the World Summit for Social Development. The problem of the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs remains a source of global concern. The struggle against this scourge requires concerted  strong action by all countries. For its part  in order to contribute to the international effort the Lao Government has cooperated in the sphere of integrated rural development with certain interested countries  especially neighbouring countries  as well as with international organizations  including the United Nations International Drug Control Programme  and we are prepared to continue this cooperation. In conclusion  the Lao delegation wishes to assure the President  Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria  of its complete cooperation. We will work in a constructive spirit with other delegations to contribute to the success of this session of the General Assembly. "
"90",3966,"LBN",47,1992,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador Ganev of Bulgaria on his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that he will conduct the work of the session wisely and effectively and we take satisfaction in the bonds of friendship and mutual cooperation between our two countries. I should like on this occasion to pay tribute to Ambassador Samir Shihabi for the sagacious leadership and courage he demonstrated in presiding over the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. He indeed deserves our deep thanks and appreciation. I have pleasure also in extending warm greetings to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. We commend the resolve and ability he has shown in steering the work of the Organization over the short period of time that has passed since the start of his mandate and his declared intent to make the United Nations more compatible with the political changes that have taken place in international politics and the resultant increasing demands upon the Organization in the areas of peace-keeping  peacemaking  development and humanitarian assistance. I am duty bound to extend our esteem and appreciation also to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the former Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his able leadership of the Organization's work for 10 years and for the sincere concern he showed over the suffering of Lebanon during its protracted agony. Lebanon  a founding Member of the United Nations  welcomes the new Member States and considers their membership to be an enhancement of the Organization's universality  credibility and significance. Over the past few years  the world witnessed a series of historic events that have led to a fundamental transformation in international relations. With the collapse of ideological barriers  the cold war has come to an end and thus dialogue  cooperation and realism have taken the place of confrontation  alliances and mutual mistrust. New States have emerged  many political systems have changed  and some States have opted for more open economic policies. Throughout the world  all of this has generated a feeling of movement and given rise to expectations and optimism. These changes and new realities have had a direct impact on the status of the United Nations and its role in dealing with regional and international problems as the atmosphere of dentente has created more and better opportunities for the Security Council to deal more effectively with world problems and to adopt resolutions and implement them. The increased need for the United Nations system and its mechanisms has necessitated the structural modernization of the Organization in order for it to improve its performance at all levels. The dramatic transformations that have taken place in the world have provided humanity with an opportunity to tackle its economic and social problems and to move forward towards the building of a better world  based on a collective commitment to peace  interdependence in the face of crises and partnership in working for development and progress. While the Middle East region still continues to suffer from its chronic problems  a gleam of hope has appeared in the midst of the world's changing realities. A serious peace initiative has shaped up  starting with the convening in Madrid of a special peace conference on the Middle East on 30 October 1991  under the auspices of the United States of America and the then Soviet Union. In response to the letter of invitation from the co-sponsors of the conference  and on the basis of the United States letter of assurances which specified the necessity of fully implementing Security Council resolution 425 (1978) and of fully respecting and preserving Lebanon's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders  Lebanon has participated in the peace conference wholeheartedly and with clear determination. By so doing  Lebanon has committed itself  irrevocably  to the pursuance of the peace process within the principles and parameters upon which it has been based and through which the process is expected to achieve its objectives  especially the objective of comprehensive  durable and just peace  and the settlement of the the Arab-Israeli conflict in all its aspects and with all its complexities. Lebanon cannot help but be involved in this process of comprehensive peace on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and the land-for-peace formula. Given its history  cultural heritage and geographic location  Lebanon  since time immemorial  has played a major and outstanding role in the cultural development of this important region to which it belongs and of which it is an integral part. It influences what happens in the region and is greatly influenced thereby. Hence  Lebanon's complete solidarity with its Arab brethren and its involvement  side by side with them  in the search for real peace.  We must recall here that Lebanon has borne and continues to bear the consequences of the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict. Let me mention  in this context  a few of the major aspects: First  the presence of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Lebanon. In this respect  let us reaffirm  once more  our total and absolute rejection of the settlement of Palestinians on the soil of Lebanon. This is against our national interest  on the one hand  and  on the other  contravenes the principle of self-determination. Secondly  the Israeli attack against Beirut International Airport on 28 December 1968. Thirdly  the invasion of southern Lebanon by the Israeli army in 1978. Fourthly  the massive full-scale Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982  which reached Beirut itself  the only Arab capital ever occupied by Israel. Fifthly  no less than 150 000 fatalities and more than 400 000 injured or disabled over the past 16 years of bloody events in Lebanon  in addition to the billions of dollars worth of material damage resulting from destruction and devastation not to mention the human misery resulting from migration and displacement.  Sixthly  the continued occupation by Israel of parts of Lebanon's territory in the south and the western Bekaa. That occupation in itself  together with the attendant Israeli practices and acts of aggression  constitutes flagrant violations of the principles and norms of international legality. Herein lies the importance of implementing Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which calls for Israel's complete withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese territories. Lebanon has always emphasized the need to implement that resolution through the mechanism referred to in Security Council resolution 426 (1978)  as Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territories would create the propitious conditions for Lebanon to regain its strength and stability  so that it may contribute fully and effectively to the peace process and  subsequently  carry out faithfully and scrupulously the commitments resulting from that process. We believe that if Israel were to allow the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to perform its significant role properly  as mandated by the Security Council  UNIFIL would be able to discharge its mandate more effectively and successfully. To enable UNIFIL to do that would be to reaffirm and highlight the increasingly important role of the United Nations in peace-keeping. Hence our call for demonstrating the prime importance of the participation of the United Nations in the peace process as it is the accredited representative of international legality whose relevant resolutions constitute the very foundations of the peace process. The Lebanese army which has been reorganized and regrouped on a sound and effective basis has regained its ability to perform its duty in extending the authority of the Lebanese State over our entire national territory  up to the internationally recognized Lebanese borders. The Lebanese authorities are prepared to shoulder their full responsibilities with regard to the maintaining of law and order and ensuring that the south of the country becomes an oasis of peace and security under the rule of law and in cooperation with UNIFIL. The Lebanese delegation to the peace conference has received assurances from the Israeli delegation in the name of its Government to the effect that Israel does not have any territorial ambitions or designs on the land and waters of Lebanon. This gives us hope that Israel will translate those assurances into concrete actions by withdrawing completely from all the Lebanese occupied territories. Lebanon strongly believes in the right of all parties to mutual security  provided that the security of any one party is not achieved at the expense of another's. Proceeding from the foregoing  we declare from this rostrum and before this Assembly that the Lebanese Government and people are fully committed to the peace process and are determined to go ahead  regardless of the difficulties. We shall spare no effort in ensuring success for the peace process so that it may achieve its lofty goals. We in Lebanon attach great importance to the peace talks and realize that their success will be in the interest of all. We are aware also that to proceed in the opposite direction will be a blunder for which the region and the whole world would pay very dearly indeed. The Lebanese Government continues to address the tremendous problems and to face up to the challenges that confront Lebanon after years of devastating strife. It has taken major steps towards rebuilding its constitutional institutions in accordance with the Taif Agreement and  for the first time in 20 years  has organized national parliamentary elections.  The main task that now faces the Lebanese Government is that of rebuilding the infrastructure of basic services and the vital sectors of the economy. Our economic sectors still suffer from the destruction caused by war and invasion  and the Lebanese people continue to feel the horrendous effects of galloping inflation due to the decline in the purchasing power of the national currency. The State budget is in the grip of a huge deficit owing to the loss of basic sources of national income such as tourism and the service sector. Regional crises  the latest of which was that of the Gulf  have also had sharp negative repercussions on the country. The Lebanese still await the honouring of regional and international promises of help in revitalizing their national economy. The delay in supporting the reconstruction and development efforts that are already under way is very regrettable  particularly since in previous years hundreds of millions of dollars were poured into Lebanon to fuel the devastating strife and keep its flames alive. The revitalization of Lebanon's economy would be an excellent investment in the future of the region. Lebanon and the Lebanese have played a pioneering role in modernizing and developing the region  and they still have the dynamism and ambition to play anew that same constructive role. At this critical juncture the Lebanese economy is in urgent need of foreign financial and technical assistance  whether from fraternal or other friendly countries or from United Nations agencies and other organizations. A quick and effective investment in the order of billions of dollars is needed. Lebanese laws and regulations ensure for foreign capital funds and investments a free and open working atmosphere  the same atmosphere that  previously  had made Lebanon an important business and financial centre which attracted international investments and financial establishments of all kinds.  We look forward to the establishment of the Arab and international fund for the reconstruction and development of Lebanon  as it represents the promised and effective initiative needed to revitalize the Lebanese economy and set it on course anew. Despite the disappearance of a considerable number of international problems  a number of national problems have re-emerged to take their place after having remained dormant for half a century. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the resultant conflicts are prime examples. In this regard  we denounce and condemn the aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina which targets that republic's very existence. This aggression has caused the death of tens of thousands of innocent victims and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians. This tragedy requires decisive action on the part of the international community to stop the military operations  to preserve the independence and sovereignty of this young republic and to return all displaced persons to their homes and properties. We commend the humanitarian role of the United Nations Nations in providing relief assistance to the besieged towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina  in the face of considerable difficulties and dangers. Equally  we commend the sincere and persistent efforts made by the Organization and its specialized agencies to bring food supplies to the people of Somalia in their plight. We call upon the international community to redouble its efforts to put an end to the distressing human tragedy in that country. Thus far  the world economic situation and the relations between the developed and developing countries have not been positively affected by detente or by the political changes that have taken place in the world. The problems of foreign debt  the shortfall in development assistance  the rise in interest rates and the continued trade barriers all constitute serious obstacles to development in the South  whereas the developing countries are in urgent need for development if a decent standard of living were to be ensured for the overwhelming majority of mankind and if the prospects of world peace were to be guaranteed. The Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit last June highlighted the relationship between environment and development. There has been an increasing awareness over the past decades of the dangers that threaten the ecological balance and the future of life on the planet. The achievements of the summit were a promising start toward a series of wide ranging changes in the production and consumption patterns that countries must adopt with a view to avoiding climatic changes  depletion of the ozone layer  the spread of desertification  and air and water pollution as well as managing toxic wastes and radioactive materials. Here too  interdependence and shared responsibilities appear to be the only option available to us in our dealings with nature and in our attempts to achieve sustainable economic growth. While we welcome the resolutions adopted at the Rio Conference  we entertain the hope that the necessary funds will be made available to Agenda 21 for the 21st century  which will help ensure the well-being of future generations as well as the future of life on earth itself. The Government of Lebanon continues to pursue its policy of eliminating the traces of the tragic and devastating period that engulfed the country. During this year  we have managed to put an end to a problem that was associated with the name of Lebanon: I refer to the question of hostage taking. This solution was achieved thanks to the praiseworthy efforts of the Secretary-General and his personal representative  Mr. Picco  and with the cooperation of the parties concerned in the region. Lebanon has always  condemned this phenomenon  for it contradicts the basic principles of law and human rights. Such abnormal practices never served or sought to serve the interests of Lebanon. Indeed Lebanon has always been their victim. For many years  the mention of Lebanon or ""Lebanonization"" evoked images of fragmentation  devastation and human misery. Today  however  despite all its difficulties and sufferings  Lebanon stands before the international community as an example of steadfastness  rebirth  creative coexistence  and diversity within unity. All of these qualities made Lebanon what it was in the past and what will make it what it will be in the future: an oasis of prosperity  openness and a beacon. This is our plan for the Lebanon of tomorrow. To realize it  we expect support and backing from our brethren in the region and from all of our friends in the world. "
"91",4013,"LBR",47,1992,"We ask the President to accept our hearty congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We pledge to him the fullest support and cooperation of the Liberian delegation as he puts forth his best efforts in guiding the deliberations of the Assembly. We offer his illustrious predecessor. Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  our deepest appreciation for the able manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-sixth session  and we wish him well in his future endeavours. We welcome the advent of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a distinguished African scholar and diplomat  to the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations. His stewardship of the Organization since the beginning of this year has witnessed the utilization of the finest diplomatic skills  undiminished resolve  and broad vision to address the many challenging problems which now confront the international community. This singular commitment on his part to the cause of global peace and security  social justice and economic prosperity has inspired tremendous confidence that the United Nations will continue to be the appropriate forum for harnessing various ideas which can promote the betterment of mankind. We also welcome and extend a hand of friendship to the newly admitted Members of the United Nations. We entertain the fervent hope that their participation will contribute to the achievement of its lofty ideals and objectives. The cessation of the ideological antagonism which characterized the cold-war era aroused great expectations that our global village would be visited by a climate of international peace  tolerance and goodwill whereby our energies could be devoted to grappling with the myriad problems of underdevelopment. Unfortunately  with apocalyptic premonition  there are wars and rumours of war casting grim shadows throughout our one world. In Somalia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  in some of the nations emerging from the former Soviet Union  and even in my own country  Liberia  wars are raging  brought about by either nationalistic yearnings  ethnic and religious rivalries  or by sheer greed for wealth and power. Although the United Nations does respond  sometimes much too belatedly  to such crises  there is an urgent need for the Organization to employ its moral authority in a more effective and non-selective way at the early stages of conflicts to prevent the human tragedies which so frequently revisit mankind. In this connection the Liberian delegation notes with appreciation the comprehensive and insightful report of the Secretary-General entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  in which he outlines specific measures and proposals to enhance  in a more vigorous and non-selective way  greater United Nations involvement in preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace enforcement. Within this context Member States that are better endowed must exercise leadership to ensure that the United Nations becomes ready  willing and able to engage constructively in humanitarian intervention in internal conflicts  consistent with the guiding principles annexed to General Assembly resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991 and Article 2  paragraph 7  of the United Nations Charter. At this juncture we would wish to apprise delegations of developments in Liberia and of Liberia's continuing quest for peace. Since 24 December 1989  when rebel forces effected an incursion into Liberia from a neighbouring country  Africa's oldest republic has been embroiled in a tragic civil strife replete with atrocious mayhem  murder and madness. In a three-way armed struggle for power in which the ""enemy"" was defined with scarce exactitude  each faction preyed on the civilian population  whose cries for help were heard by a largely indifferent world. Liberia  a beacon of hope in Africa as a sovereign expression since 1847  a country which welcomed and assimilated into its society thousands of other Africans from neighbouring countries and elsewhere  was rapidly reduced to a land of grief and desolation. This fratricide impelled about 800 000 of our citizens to seek sanctuary in neighbouring countries. After the disintegration of the Government and the attendant breakdown of civil authority  and in order to avert further bloodshed  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) undertook a mediatory initiative by advancing a plan that secured the concurrence of all the interested parties. The ECOWAS peace plan required  inter alia  the deployment of a peace-keeping force  the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG)  as well as the formation of an interim Government of National Unity to include the warring factions  the political parties and the interest groups of the country. In August 1990 ECOWAS facilitated the convening of a national conference so that Liberians could deliberate on the future of their country  form an interim government and undertake the initial plans for free and fair elections to be conducted under international supervision and monitoring. The National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL)  the main rebel faction  led by Mr. Charles Taylor  failed to attend  apparently opting for a military solution that was still vainly expected to arise from what was already a war of attrition. At the Conference  the delegates worked within the scope of the peace plan that had been accepted by the warring factions as the basis for mediation. It required that none of the leaders of the armed groups would serve as interim President and that the interim President would be a caretaker and not participate in the elections. Accordingly  the Conference reserved for the NPFL leader the position of Speaker of the Legislative Assembly  the highest position in the interim government  from which he could still seek the presidency of the country in a free and fair election. The NPFL was also awarded a majority seating in the interim Legislative Assembly. However  this overture failed to induce the NPFL and its leader to find some common ground with other Liberians. The Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS  meeting at an extraordinary summit at Bamako in November 1990. negotiated a cease-fire declaration and urged Liberians to continue the search for peace by holding another national conference at which the NPFL could be present. ECOWAS convened a second national conference at Monrovia in March 1991  at which an NPFL delegation participated in the negotiation of an arrangement for the governance of the country along the lines of a framework it advanced. The euphoria that attended chose preliminary results were short-lived  as the conclusions reached were summarily rejected by the NPFL leader. A few months thereafter the NPFL alerted some of the leaders of ECOWAS that it was not prepared to participate in an interim government that would  alternatively  be disposed to negotiating  under the auspices of ECOWAS  another proposal of its own. The NPFL proposed a snap election  to be held within six months  to be preceded by the encampment and disarmament of all armed combatants. ECOWAS established the Committee of Five  headed by His Excellency President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'lvoire  to work with Liberians and help us reach an understanding. The negotiations took place in four different meetings  producing an agreement which  because of the venue  has become known as the Yamoussoukro Accord. This Accord has aroused declarations of support from the Organization of African Unity  the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the United Nations Security Council. But how has the NPFL reacted to the commitments it undertook? At the fifteenth session of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS  held at Dakar in July 1992  the 16 West African leaders reached a clear consensus and observed: ""The Authority determined that the uncooperative conduct by the NPFL  especially with regard to the encampment and disarmament of the combatants and the insertion of a buffer zone along the Liberia-Sierra Leone border  continued to pose a serious threat to the peace  stability and security of the West African region."" The Authority therefore mandated the Field Commander of ECOMOG to complete the implementation of the programme contained in the Yamoussoukro Accord not later than 30 days from the conclusion of the summit meeting. Furthermore  the West African leaders decided: ""That unless Charles Taylor and the NPFL comply with the implementation of the said programme  the Authority shall impose comprehensive sanctions against Charles Taylor and the NPFL-controlled areas of Liberia and any other party that fails to comply with the implementation of the programme; that all the Member States of ECOWAS shall take all necessary measures to give full effect to this decision; that the Committee of Five  in consultation with the Standing Mediation Committee  shall seek the assistance of the Security Council of the United Nations to make whatever sanctions are imposed effective and binding on all members of the international community in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter."" In support of the decision taken by the ECOWAS Heads of State  the Tenth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries  meeting in Jakarta in September 1992  said  inter alia  in its Final Documents: ""if ... there are parties still frustrating the efforts to create the required climate for the holding of free and fair elections in Liberia  stringent economic sanctions as proposed by the ECOWAS Summit ... [shall) be imposed on such parties and the areas they control."" It also ""appealed to the international community to support said sanctions  if and when invoked  as well as provide necessary assistance to Liberia and the Economic Community of West African States Ceasefire Monitoring Observer Group (ECOMOG)."" We expect that the Security Council of the United Nations will be equally supportive. Consistent with the spirit of its responsibilities  the Interim Government of National Unity has taken several measures aimed at enhancing the NPFL's capacity to cooperate in the implementation of the undertakings into which it willingly entered. We have successfully contributed to sensitizing those countries that can prove helpful in assisting with funding for demobilizing and rehabilitating combatants. An amnesty has been offered to enhance the prospects for reconciliation. We have secured food for the NPFL to help alleviate the strains incidental to the encampment of its troops  which  to use its leader's words  are currently ""living off the land"". To give confidence to the NPFL with respect to the pending elections  we offered it the position of Chairman of  as well as majority seating on  the Elections Commission. This we did even though the political party that it is now forming is only one grouping to enter an election with at least six other parties. It should be recalled that Dr. Amos Sawyer  President of the Interim Government of National Unity  will not be a candidate in these elections and that therefore the advantages of incumbency are not a factor here. Moreover  Dr. Sawyer has announced that  in order to ensure a unified country  if Mr. Taylor would concede his forces' being encamped and disarmed  and if he would renounce his claims to a bogus presidency in the area he controls. Dr. Sawyer would resign in favour of another Liberian acceptable to both sides  who would hold the country together through the remaining months leading to elections. We  the people of Liberia  know what we want. We want an end to the war. we want a unified country. We want free and fair elections. While we concede the existence of some deep-seated problems clouded by suspicion and demanding circumspection  our difficulties are being compounded by the influence that external factors and forces wield over the NPFL. This is not to suggest that Liberians are not ultimately responsible for the havoc we have wrought on our country  but it is important for the international community to understand and appreciate the variables which tend to make peace elusive in Liberia. The Liberian crisis was planned abroad. Many of the insurgents were trained outside the country. Those who initially provided the training  arms  and finances have tried to explain to us their motives  couched in spurious arguments of revolutionary duty to their oppressed African brothers. We must remember  too  that the insurgents crossed an internationally recognized boundary and appear still to be receiving the cooperation and support of some of our would-be brotherly peoples. We remain aware that as the NPFL advanced there was a systematic plundering of the country  with the extraction from Liberia of movable capital assets  from earth-moving equipment to power plants  from computers to automobiles  primarily by the route by which the insurgents came. We are also cognizant of the fact that a few multinational corporations  some with investments in the country  provided material and financial assistance to the NPFL  with the intention of hastening its advance. There are others which  acting on the presumption of an imminent NPFL victory  provided similar assistance to secure concessions in natural rubber  iron ore and timber resources. We are aware that some of these foreign corporations believe they have become too involved to disengage now  and they have sought the support or acquiescence of their countries in what is transpiring in Liberia.  We Liberians are concerned about the causes underpinning our present dilemma. We do not wish to see our country go the way many small countries have gone by being embroiled in a protracted civil conflict over the spoils of war. Liberia need not be destroyed in a quest for economic advantages. There is no reason for the pitting of Liberians against each other in a zero-sum game and the transformation of the country into a mass grave.  We recognize that we live in an interdependent world and accept the fact that economic ends or objectives will be pursued in our country. However  we are dismayed by the senselessness of the manner and the means. Results which can be achieved in an organized  civilized and equitable way need not be pursued in a manner replete with disorder  carnage and confusion. As we Liberians want to reconstruct our lives the future being all we have left we affirm here and now that all the signs of good neighbourliness we are already demonstrating are sincere and genuine and that they will continue to be a sustained national policy. In the same vein  corporate entities that were lured into errors of judgement will be expected to participate in time in open-minded discussions with the intent that they should become actual partners in progress with the people of Liberia. The intransigence and negative attitude of the NPFL has led to the emergence on the scene of a fourth force  the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO)  which has declared itself to be a group of Liberian refugees trying to find their way home. They also claim that their primary objective is to compel the NPFL to adhere to the Yamoussoukro accord. The ULIMO has engaged NPFL forces and recently  in a rapid advance  captured several areas that had been under NPFL control. We  the Interim Government  will continue our efforts to have a cease-fire arranged between these contending forces. There is an urgent need to avoid escalation through the likely involvement of the other forces  which have been encamped for more than a year  awaiting the encampment of the NPFL for the commencement of general disarmament. Under cover of the security blanket provided by ECOMOG  the Interim Government of National Unity has succeeded in re-establishing an acceptable  level of civil administration. We are pleased to note that since last year schools have been open  with banking  mercantile and other commercial activities resumed. Residents are being provided with basic social services within the limits of our resources. We wish to observe that  despite the emergency situation  we have been able to operate under the rule of law with a constitutional Government which respects human rights. We take pride in the fact that the people of Liberia have demonstrated both a spirit of cooperation and the tenacity and the will to reorder their lives  in spite of tremendous hardship. Monrovia  which had a pre-war population of less than 500 000  has grown to about 1.2 million as hundreds of thousands of our citizens continue to seek refuge in the relative safety and normalcy of the capital. This mass migration is placing a serious strain on the Government's meagre resources  taking into account that the principal sources of revenue are under NPFL control. As such  there is still a need for continued humanitarian assistance to the country. Concurrent with the effort to bring peace to Liberia and secure appropriate conditions for holding free and fair elections  Liberia and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have invited the United Nations to assist with the electoral process. The Secretary-General has already sent consultants to Liberia to evaluate the availability of population data and the situation of constituency maps  and to provide support to the Elections Commission. We wish to register our appreciation to the States Members of the United Nations for the several resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in response to the critical humanitarian and other needs of Liberia since the  civil strife began. We wish to thank all the countries  especially the United States  Japan  the European Community  the Nordic countries and others  which have made significant contributions in response to the appeals of the Secretary-General both for the United Nations emergency programme in Liberia and for assistance to the neighbouring countries which host Liberian refugees. We also express our gratitude to the United Nations system  and to all the non-governmental and private volunteer organizations which have continued to provide assistance to our people. We trust we can rely on the international community for its continued empathy and support as Liberia goes through the most difficult period of its history. The timely initiative of the Economic Community of West African States to mediate in the Liberian conflict was a laudable response by a subregion to a subregional problem  consistent with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. This initiative is most deserving of the encouragement and support of the international community. We therefore call on the United Nations to play an active role in mobilizing financial and other support for ECOWAS as it responds to the Liberian crisis  which continues to pose a threat to regional peace and security. On behalf of the Government and the people of Liberia  we wish once again to extend our heartfelt appreciation to all the member States of ECOWAS  particularly the Governments and peoples of Nigeria  Ghana  Senegal  Guinea  Sierra Leone  the Gambia and Mali  which are participating in ECOMOG. We thank all of them for the many sacrifices they are making to restore peace to Liberia. While we are preoccupied with domestic considerations  we have firm views which we would like to advance with respect to some of the issues on the international agenda. The painful and tragic situation in Somalia is a grim reminder to the people of Liberia of the ethnic strife  the wanton destruction of life and property  the grave refugee problem and the disintegration of the country that we ourselves experienced. The appalling human condition of the Somali people makes them deserving of treatment equal to  if not greater than  that given any other country experiencing a civil conflict. That is why we are most pleased with the recent initiative taken by the Secretary-General in arousing the conscience of the international community to the plight of Somalia. We also applaud the active role he is playing to resolve the conflict. With respect to developments in South Africa  the Government of Liberia views with serious concern the gruesome sectarian violence in that country. In view of the positive steps that the South African Government  yielding to international pressure  was taking to end apartheid  it is most distressing to receive indications of that Government's apparent collusion with the appointed leaders of homelands to unleash unprovoked violence and death on defenceless civilians engaged in a legitimate exercise of protest. Such action can only put at risk the gains that have been made by all South Africans. We therefore urge the South African authorities to take speedy action to arrest black township violence and exclude from the security apparatus those responsible for the recent atrocities. My delegation is encouraged by the reports that the leader of the African National Congress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  and President de Klerk have resumed talks on the country's political future. We appeal  however  to Chief Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha freedom movement to rejoin his compatriots in the negotiations for the establishment of a non-racial  democratic society. The tragic story of Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of continuing suffering  destruction and death. It heightens profound fears that if the situation is not urgently arrested the world could find itself involved in a major effort to prevent the extinction of a national group due to the horrendous policy of ""ethnic cleansing."" Liberia deplores that inhumane practice and calls for enforcement action in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. With regard to the situation in the Middle East  Liberia welcomes the renewed efforts by the parties to the crisis and others to move the peace process forward. It is our continuing belief that only a negotiated  settlement within the parameters of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) can bring a just and lasting peace to that troubled region. One of the perennial issues before the Assembly has been the need to ameliorate the poverty and underdevelopment that plague the developing countries. The mounting debt burden  the decline in commodity prices and increasing protectionism are some of the factors contributing to the economic stagnation in many developing countries. My Government is therefore concerned about the delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. We entertain the hope that the negotiations will be completed before the end of 1992  as envisaged. It was in appreciation of the disturbing economic trends that I have mentioned that the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly adopted a New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Liberia calls upon the international community to support the Agenda wholeheartedly in order to grant relief to African countries. Another important task of this session of the General Assembly is to follow up the decisions taken by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which was held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. The decision by most countries to sign the Conventions on climate change and on biodiversity  as well as to adopt a comprehensive programme for sustainable development. Agenda 21  reaffirmed awareness of the fundamental relationship between development and the environment. As the Secretary-General observes in his report  Agenda 21 constitutes the centrepiece of international cooperation and coordination activities within the United Nations system for years to come  it is therefore Liberia's sincere hope that at this session the General Assembly will take appropriate measures to ensure the full implementation of the historic decision that has been reached. The rapid pace of change and the shrinking of our planet by faster means of travel and communication have combined to make more relevant the interdependence of nations. As such  Liberia reaffirms its abiding faith in and commitment to the principles of the United Nations that have stood mankind in good stead. Like those whose vision led to the birth of the Organization at a time of great upheavals and challenges  we too must call forth the best in us to ensure that we bequeath to posterity a world safe from pockets of wars and the attendant dreadful consequences. In pursuit of that attainable goal we must banish from our minds all forms of mistrust  suspicion  fears and prejudices which  more often than not  define our behaviour in national and international affairs. If we muster the courage and the will to face squarely the new realities of the post-cold-war era  then the chances will be enhanced of a stable international environment in which the United Nations can promote social progress and development while keeping the peace.

"92",4059,"LBY",47,1992,"It gives me pleasure at the outset to join the speakers who preceded me in congratulating you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. My delegation is confident that your wide experience and diplomatic skill will contribute to the success of the session. I should like also to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the affairs of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am pleased also to convey our appreciation and praise to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for this consistent efforts  in the face of numerous impediments  to strengthen the role of the Organization in achieving the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter  as well as for his Agenda for Peace proposals aimed at enhancing the role of the United Nations in preserving international peace and security  ensuring justice and protecting human rights. I should like too to welcome the new Members of the Organization: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Slovenia  Moldova  San Marino  Tajikistan  Uzbekistan  Turkmenistan and Georgia. Their accession to the Organization's membership is a further step towards the complete universality of our Organization. It also enhances international acceptability of the principles and purposes of this great Organization and boosts its efforts to achieve justice  prosperity  progress and international peace and security. Since the last session  international relations and the international balance of power have undergone profound changes and transformations. Those changes have resulted in  among other things  the collapse and disintegration of what was known as the Soviet Union  and the end of bipolarity. The world has begun to seek the establishment of an alternative order whose features have not crystallized. In the meantime  there are signs that several of the cold-war problems such as certain regional conflicts  the dismantling of the apartheid system in South Africa and the slowing down of the arms race may be amenable to solution. These developments in international relations have created new opportunities and new challenges. The challenges must be confronted by the international community with all seriousness and determination.' This should be done by strengthening the spirit of understanding and reconciliation that now prevails in international relations. However  this optimism should not stop us from conceding that certain old questions and problems have not been resolved yet. Furthermore  those developments have created new hotbeds of tension in certain areas of the world  as evidenced by the eruption of the ethnic conflicts and civil wars that have cast their shadows on the international arena. Such unwelcome trends make it incumbent upon the international community to do more to strengthen the positive trends in international relations so that we may resolve the residual and the new problems alike. Within that context  my country supports the efforts of the States of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to reach a speedy solution to the Liberian problem. We also urge the international community to encourage the Afghans to settle their differences in a manner that would spare them new confrontation. And we call on the international community to work seriously to end the bloody conflict in the Balkans by encouraging the republics of the former Yugoslavia to settle their disputes through dialogue and negotiation instead of force and violence. The international community should redouble its efforts to put an end to the human tragedy of the Somali people and to take appropriate measures to reach a rational reconciliation  thereby guaranteeing a dignified life for the Somalis  who are facing a massive famine. As for the conflict between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab Emirates  over the islands of Abu Mousa  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb  we would like to state the need to adhere to the international norms and conventions that prohibit the occupation by force of the territory of another State. We call upon our brethren in Iran and the United Arab Emirates to allow reason  respect for good-neighbourliness  and the principle of sovereignty to prevail  and to search for a peaceful solution to this conflict  thereby sparing the region an escalation in tensions. The just cause of the Palestinian people has been with the United Nations since its inception. Notwithstanding the adoption of numerous resolutions by the General Assembly  the Security Council and other organs  the Organization remains unable to implement its own resolutions. As the Secretary-General states in his report to the Security Council on preventive diplomacy  ""The principles of the Charter should be applied consistently  not selectively  for if the perception should be of the latter  trust will wane and with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most unique quality of that instrument."" (A/47/277  para. 82) Due to clear discrimination against the Palestinian people who remain under the yoke of Israeli occupation and suffer all forms of oppression  repression  enslavement and injustice caused by an international community which employs double standards that people rose up in an intifadah against Israeli occupation  insisting  properly  on their right to self-determination and demonstrating that the will of peoples cannot be crushed by repression. We should like to reaffirm from this rostrum our support for the intifadah of the Palestinian people against injustice and for that people's right to liberate their land  to exercise self-determination and to establish their own independent and sovereign State. We urge the international community to translate its support of the Palestinian people into practical measures by pressing for the immediate halting of Jewish immigration to Palestine and the occupied Arab territories  the complete halting of the building of Israeli settlements  the protection of the Palestinian people and the implementation of all resolutions relevant to the Palestinian question and to the occupied Arab territories  so that peace and justice may prevail in all parts of the Middle East. Despite all the encouraging developments in South Africa over the past two years  recent events have shown that the situation there is still a source of tension and cause for concern. The recent eruption and escalation of violence is an ominous sign of a possible explosion that may jeopardize the process designed to abolish apartheid through negotiation. While welcoming the steps recently taken by the international community in this respect  my country will continue its support of the South African people's struggle to eradicate the system of apartheid  which  it seems  is unwilling to desist from its racist practices voluntarily and  chameleon-like  is desperately trying to disguise itself. Therefore  all of us must maintain the pressure on that regime to make it heed the will of the majority  the will of the international community and the relevant United Nations resolutions. The remarkable changes and developments in today's world impose new responsibilities on the United Nations in performing its role as an instrument of preserving world peace and security and promoting stability  reconciliation  development and prosperity for all. Small and vulnerable countries have taken heart from the Organization's increased capabilities  especially now that the Organization has achieved marked success in the settlement of disputes in Cambodia and Afghanistan  in the realization of Namibia's independence and in supporting the legitimate struggle of the people of South Africa to dismantle apartheid. Notwithstanding those positive indications in the Organization's work  it has been noted that some still continue to dominate the Organization and to use it  under various pretexts  to serve their own political purposes through the law of force rather than the force of the law  and by pursuing policies of political and military intervention as well as economic pressure. The pressures to which Libya has been subjected are part and parcel of those policies. The same is true of what has been visited upon the Iraqi people. Thus  we call for an end to the embargo imposed against the people of Iraq  for an end to their starvation  for respecting their sovereignty and for non-interference in their internal affairs. What has become known as the Lockerbie Case is one of the by-products of the present international situation and illustrates its effect on small countries that pursue independent policies and take independent positions. The case also shows the need to introduce basic changes in the mechanism by which resolutions are adopted in the United Nations  and especially in the Security Council  so as to make them more expressive of the will of the international community. The case also pinpoints the dangers inherent in the tendency of certain States to use the powers of the Security Council to  achieve their own private objectives and to use double standards in dealing with issues before the Council in a manner that deals high-handedly and arbitrarily with the sovereignty and rights of small and vulnerable countries. The Lockerbie Case was raised and forced upon the Security Council and dealt with under Chapter VII of the Charter  which does not apply  since Libya neither threatened world peace nor threatened or committed aggression against another country  actions it would have to have taken to be liable under the provisions of Chapter VII  which relates to the maintenance of international peace and security. Conscious of that  and based on its abhorrence of terrorism  of which it is a victim  my country expressed  in good will  its sincere willingness to cooperate in uncovering the facts and circumstances relating to the case. Upon being notified of the matter  my country took all required legal measures consistent with international law and conventions that do not violate Libya's sovereign rights. Regrettably  however  the interested parties refused to cooperate with the Libyan legal authorities  which had offered to conduct joint investigations of the two Libyan suspects. When the States concerned referred the matter to the Security Council  which adopted resolution 731 (1992) calling upon Libya to cooperate  my country  in letters to the United Nations Secretary-General  expressed its acceptance of the resolution and proposed a series of initiatives to implement it. Throughout  my country has been motivated by a desire to reach a settlement that would guarantee the rights of all parties and spare the region the dangers of  tension and instability. However  the Libyan initiatives concerning the implementation of the provisions of the resolution met the same fate as earlier ones  for the countries concerned rushed to the Security Council to seek adoption of another resolution imposing unjust sanctions against the small  peaceful Libyan people  without any legal basis or moral justification. That action completely ignored my country's declared commitment to effective cooperation in the implementation of Security Council resolution 731 (1992)  as set out clearly in document S/23917 of 14 May 1992. The commitment was welcomed by the great majority of the family of nations as represented in the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  the Organization of African Unity  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the League of Arab States  all of which expressed solidarity with the fair Libyan position from the very start of the crisis. In all of their decisions and final statements issued in September 1992 those organizations were unanimous on the following points. First  praised Libya's cooperation in seeking a peaceful settlement of the crisis within the context of Libya's national sovereignty  international law  and the principles of the United Nations Charter that govern relations between independent States. Secondly  called on the parties concerned to respond positively to Libya's initiatives calling for dialogue  negotiation  and non-escalation  in order to reach a solution to the crisis under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations and under the auspices of the Secretary-General  in a manner that would be conducive to ending the crisis and its repercussions peacefully  fairly and quickly. Thirdly  called upon the Security Council to lift the measures imposed on Libya  which has expressed its commitment to resolution 731 (1992) As part of its initiatives  Libya has recently called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to send an international committee to verify that Libya has met all the requirements of Security Council resolution 731 (1992) related to terrorism. Once again  the parties concerned prevented the Secretary-General from responding to this proposal  and - at a time when my country had expected the Council to lift or reduce the unjust sanctions in the light of Libya's positive response to the requirements of resolution 731 (1992) concerning terrorism  which we unequivocally condemn  and its complete willingness to provide a fair and unbiased trial for the suspects  which has been agreed to sought to persuade the Security Council to adopt a new resolution extending the sanctions for four more months. My country still calls for a peaceful settlement to this situation  a settlement that will safeguard the rights of all  maintain the principles of international law  and save the world from escalation and confrontation. The unjust sanctions against my country have caused a great deal of human and material harm  loss and suffering to the Libyan people. My country has already detailed those losses and damages in official circulating documents of the Security Council. The embargo has affected numerous sectors  especially in the fields of health and social services. One example of this is the fact that the delay in the arrival of medical supplies and instruments has led to the deaths of a large number of children  and pregnant women who died in labour. It was also impossible to send abroad over 3 000 medical cases that can not be treated locally  including cases of heart disease  kidney transplants  bone-marrow transplants  neurosurgery  and burns. One hundred and fifty gravely ill patients  who could not be treated locally  died while being transported overland to airports in Tunisia and Egypt. In addition  the overuse of land routes to and from the Jamahiriya resulted in an increase in road accidents during the last four months of this year compared to the same period in 1991. The number of accidents rose from 2 401 in 1991 to 3 788 over the past four months. Deaths from these accidents rose from 389 to 528  an increase of about 35 per cent. As for economic losses resulting from the air embargo  they have amounted to $2 157 million as a result of the fall in revenues generated by exports of fruits and vegetables  in addition to a 44 per cent drop in non-oil exports. The sanctions also resulted in the interruption of many industrial activities due to the shortage in means of production and spare parts  not to mention agriculture. The losses in animal and agricultural production  for example. are estimated at $1 062 803 000.00 as a result of the non-arrival of medicines and sera necessary for protecting the livestock sector against animal epidemics and communicable diseases. Those who prompted the Security Council to impose these sanctions on our small  peaceful population which has limited resources and has threatened no one bear the political  legal  and moral responsibility for the deaths of women  children  the aged  the handicapped  and the sick. They also bear responsibility for the decline in the standard of living  the slow pace of development  the spread of epidemics  and the imprisonment of an entire people inside its own borders. There is no doubt that all of this relates directly to human rights. History will bear witness to what is being perpetrated in the name of the Security Council against a small  peaceful population. Thus  my country would like from this rostrum to call upon the international Organization and the international Security Council  out of respect for the principles of justice  to lift these sanctions  which have harmed the Libyan people and the peoples of neighboring States. It also invites the concerned parties to engage in dialogue and to cooperate in order to reach a solution to this dispute based on sovereignty and mutual respect in accordance with international norms and laws. I must put before this international forum some facts that are no doubt universally accepted. The first fact is that all countries  large and small  must respect the Charter of the United Nations and uphold international law if the world is not to slip into a state of anarchy  which is in no one's interest. The objective of the United Nations should be the protection of the sovereignty of States and respect for their laws. The second fact is that the Security Council  the authority entrusted with maintaining international peace and security  should not become a tool used by some world Powers as a cover for their hegemonistic designs. The third fact is the need for an international judicial organ entrusted with trying those who commit acts of terrorism of any sort or source. Hence  we welcome the call for the establishment of an international criminal court to look into international criminal cases. The consolidation of security and cooperation in the Mediterranean region is high on the agenda of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya  for we believe that security and peace in that region is vital  not only to the coastal States  but also to the peace and security of the world. Thus  my country remains convinced that effective security in the region can be achieved only after the causes of tension that beset the Mediterranean are removed and after the foreign navies and military bases are withdrawn from it. Moreover  cooperation among its coastal States should be increased  coordinated and intensified. That is why my country would like to underscore the findings in the final declaration of the Tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement Countries  which called for supporting the efforts aimed at transforming the Mediterranean into a zone of peace  security and cooperation on the basis of the principles of respect for the equality and sovereignty of States  non-intervention in the internal affairs of others  and the non-use or threat of force.  My country has consistently affirmed that it supports disarmament because it is aware of the terrible dangers that armaments pose to our planet. In this context  Libya submitted to the Assembly a proposal calling on the United Nations General Assembly to look into the serious phenomena of concern to all nations  such as international terrorism how to deal with its causes and how to eradicate it; weapons of mass destruction  and offensive strategic weapons  which constitute a terrifying danger for all  including those who own them. The proposal refers also to offering compensation to the peoples who were colonized and subjected to repression and suppression by their colonizers. Our proposal deals also with other important issues  such as the question of refugees  exiles and the kidnapped  in addition to reviewing the Charter of the United Nations. It proposes studying various economic and social problems and the ills that afflict humanity with a view to finding a solution for all these problems and to realizing stability  prosperity and happiness for the whole world. In addition to this  it is important to solve certain political questions which have been with the United Nations since its inception. All those questions are contained in document A/46/840 of 9 January 1992. Once again  my country renews its call for disarmament through the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction of all countries which possess  produce or stockpile them  without exception or discrimination. My country  as party to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty and to the Treaty on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons and the Geneva Protocol  supports all efforts aimed at curbing the arms race and at eliminating nuclear weapons. That is why we welcome the recent agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation further to reduce their nuclear weapons. My country also welcomes France's accession to the non-proliferation Treaty. To further expand this tendency  my country supports the establishment of zones that are free of all nuclear  chemical and bacteriological weapons  including Africa and the Middle East. It also supports the proposal of the Arab Republic of Egypt which calls for declaring the Middle East an area free of weapons of mass destruction. This objective  however  is obstructed by persistent difficulties resulting from Israel's continued production  possession and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction as well as its testing of these weapons and its refusal to heed repeated international appeals to submit its nuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In this present era of change one concrete fact emerges  namely that the international community has not shown the same concern over questions of economic development as it did in regard to other questions such as those of political crises. Economic problems  which are a significant factor in the obstruction of development and growth  are still with us. This does not seem logical  especially at a time when the world looks forward to a new era of security and stability. If this new era is to materialize  appropriate measures should be taken to solve the intractable economic problems of the developing countries in particular. These include the problems arising from protectionism  lack of transfer of technology  reverse flows of resources  external debts and low commodity prices. Furthermore  the imposition of arbitrary measures and sanctions  such as economic embargoes  trade restrictions and the freezing of funds and assets by certain developed countries against a number of developing countries  must be halted. In addition  it is very important for the international community to honour its commitments vis-a-vis certain programmes  such as the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s. Africa expects a great deal from this programme which is supposed to bolster development efforts started on the continent at the regional level by establishing the African economic community  and at the subregional level in the form of groupings such as the Arab Maghreb Union  to which my country is honoured to belong. This union aims at intensifying cooperation among its member countries and with the rest of the continent. It also seeks to enter into wider cooperation with other countries of the world  especially the European Mediterranean countries  and to enhance cooperation between the countries of the South and the North. The results of the Summit on environment and development which was held in the middle of this year are a great achievement that bespeaks the international community's determination to protect the world's natural resources. The commitment of the world to preserve the environment was evident in the agreements on climatic change and biological diversity that were reached at that Conference. The important thing now is to cooperate internationally and effectively in implementing the conclusions and recommendations of the Earth Summit. In this respect  my country welcomes the decision of the Summit concerning the setting up of a standing developmental committee and hopes that this committee will become a forum for implementing the decisions of Agenda 21 which are aimed at preserving the environment while pursuing development. Conservation of the environment requires both international cooperation and national efforts. My country participated in the Rio de Janeiro Conference and signed its conventions and agreements. At the national level  my country accords top priority to questions of development. Accordingly  my country has begun to combat drought and desertification through the great man-made river project which will carry millions of cubic metres of water from the southern part of Libya to the arable land in the coastal area where the greatest part of our population lives. Our national plans aim at the reclamation of thousands of hectares of land for both agriculture and human settlement. Despite all this  my country still suffers from a severe shortage of water which is necessary for its economic development plans. This shortage not only threatens my country  but will imperil the continuation of life in North Africa and the Middle East unless it is dealt with through international cooperation. I must state here that our aspirations after development face certain difficulties which my country has raised in several regional and international forums  including the General Assembly. The Secretary-General himself spoke about those difficulties in his report. An Agenda for Peace. I am here referring to mines and the remnants of war. During the Second World War  Libyan territory was used as one of the main theatres for military operations. Our people have paid an exorbitant material and human price for a war in which our country had no stake. Since the end of that war  the Libyan people have continued to suffer from the remnants of the war and the mines and explosives planted by the warring armies in its territory. Many regional and international organizations  including the General Assembly  have adopted resolutions calling upon the countries responsible to submit the required information and technical assistance needed for the removal of those mines and remnants  and to pay compensation for the damage caused by them. Today  we reiterate our call to those countries to act in a responsible manner  to respond positively to the appeals of the international community and to implement the provisions of General Assembly resolutions relating to the remnants of war. The environment in my country is also threatened by the harmful effects of pollution in the Mediterranean  caused by the wastes poured into its water by foreign navies stationed in the area  the over-consumption and over-production of the developed Mediterranean countries and the dumping of hundreds of tons of pesticides and combustibles in its waters. This has caused an environmental imbalance that is being further aggravated by the exploitation of the Mediterranean by countries from outside the region. Human rights issues are the focus of the international community's attention and are at the top of its scale of priorities. While appreciating the role of the United Nations in ensuring the exercise of human rights and basic freedoms  we must state that those rights are not scrupulously respected in a number of regions. In addition  the double standards and the selectivity that mar the conduct of certain countries in the area of protecting human rights have prevented the United Nations  and especially the Commission on Human Rights  from effectively performing their role in this area. We hope that the World Conference on Human Rights  to be held in Vienna in mid-1993  will afford us opportunities to deliberate on all these questions and will adopt practical measures to deal with them and identify the ways and means whereby human rights may be protected and defended against violations.* My country attaches great importance to human rights and to the dignity and welfare of man. This was reaffirmed in the great green document on human rights  which includes numerous basic principles for the promotion of human rights. This has been crowned by effective and legal procedures  such as the law on enhancing freedoms  which was promulgated in 1991  the establishment of a national human rights commission and an international committee for the Qaddafi human rights award. Furthermore  Libya has acceded to most international agreements and instruments relating to human rights and measures are being taken to meet our commitments arising from accession to these agreements and instruments. One of the items on the international agenda is the setting up of a new world order. There is no doubt that such a world order will not function properly and effectively unless we overcome and rectify certain shortcomings of the United Nations  since the Organization will be the world body that will play a fundamental role in the management and coordination of that new world order. Thus  the most urgent task now is to reinvigorate the United Nations  restructure and democratize it. My country welcomes the efforts being made at present to reform the Organization and enhance its effectiveness  including the encouraging initiatives of the Secretary-General. However  a great deal remains to be done in this respect  such as ensuring full respect for the Charter  and consistent adherence to its provisions  without selectivity and without any breach of its principles. We must also ensure that the Organization is not dominated by any one and that its resolutions are respected and implemented non-selectively. Furthermore  the role of the General Assembly should be strengthened in a manner that would ensure the effective and full implementation of all its resolutions  as those resolutions are the true expression of the sum-total of the positions of all the Member States. Also  the current composition of the Security Council should be reviewed and expanded in order for it to reflect the increase in membership of the United Nations. It is also highly important to review some of the provisions of the Charter. We would like specifically to focus attention on the veto right in the Security Council. My country was the first to call for the abolition of that privilege  because it is one of the main impediments to the most important role for which the United Nations was established  namely  the maintenance of international peace and security. We have lately felt satisfaction at the expansion of this call. Many countries  including some current members of the Security Council  have voiced similar views  and have come to share our conviction that a system of collective security that continues to be subject to a veto by some countries can never be depended on to maintain peace and security. In a few years time  we will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Over the past four decades  the Organization has performed a remarkable role in decolonization and has worked tirelessly for the consolidation of international peace and security. It has taken many initiatives towards the achievement of economic development and social well-being. Hence  my country's welcome for the call to convene an International Conference on Human Rights in 1993 and an International Conference on Population in 1994  as both conferences will afford an opportunity for the re-assessment of international programmes of assistance to developing countries  with a view to achieving an optimum balance between population growth and development resources. My country welcomes also the call for convening an International Conference on Women in 1995  and attaches great importance to the World Summit for Social Development  because it will give political impetus to national  regional and international efforts and activities aimed at meeting the social needs of many developing countries. As all those world conferences will take place under circumstances of international change and transformation  my country looks forward to their results and hopes that they will lead to the laying of solid foundations and the formulation of clear-cut approaches that would lead to international efforts aimed at the strengthening of peace  security and stability for all as well as the creation of opportunities for the progress of all mankind. In these critical times and in the context of this unstable international situation  the small countries of the world look towards the United Nations with all their hopes for a brave new world of peace  security  justice and equality for all that would be built by the hands of all nations alike  large and small  wealthy and poor; a brave world in which the values of freedom  democracy and human rights are upheld and which will be free of violence  injustice and dictatorship; a world of love and brotherhood  where God's light shines above the whole Earth the one God  who is Lord of the universe. We sincerely hope that the United Nations will rise to the great challenges that face it. The President of the Assembly can count on my country's cooperation in every endeavour that will promote  enhance and realize these principles and objectives I have spoken of. With peace and love from the small  peaceful Libyan people to all your peace-loving peoples. "
"93",4117,"LIE",47,1992,"Permit me to extend to you  Mr. President  our heartfelt congratulations on your election  which demonstrates Member States' conviction that you have the ability to conduct the work of this session of the General Assembly with diplomatic skill and efficiency. I assure you of the support of the delegation of Liechtenstein. I should like to also express to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi  our recognition of his outstanding conduct of the business of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. Furthermore  I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to you  Mr. Secretary-General  for your efforts better to equip the United Nations to meet the new challenges it faces as a result of the far-reaching changes taking place in the world. We hope that the Organization  under your leadership and in close cooperation and agreement with Member States and other United Nations organs and bodies  will be able to continue to perform its important duties effectively. It is my hope that close cooperation will develop between you and my country. Two years ago Liechtenstein was accepted as the one hundred and fifty-ninth member of the United Nations. This occasion was for my country the culmination of its efforts to become an equal partner in the international community of States and to share responsibility for overcoming the global and regional problems we face today. The two years of our membership have been marked by far-reaching political changes. As one of the consequences of these changes  20 new Members have been admitted to the United Nations since 1990. Accordingly  Liechtenstein would like particularly to welcome those countries that have become Members of the United Nations this year: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Croatia  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Since its entry Liechtenstein has sought to be an active member of the United Nations  although as a small country our possibilities are very limited. We are thankful for the understanding Member States have shown for our special situation. All States  whether small or large  whether powerful or powerless  need the United Nations. Small States  however  have special grounds for belonging to the world Organization. One of these is the fact that the United Nations is based on a requirement of universal respect for the law of nations; sovereignty  especially that of a small State  can be secured  ensured and guaranteed only when all States  especially the large and powerful  respect international law. We have confidence in the United Nations  but at the same time we are aware that the Organization cannot resolve all conflicts. It can  however  establish standards of conduct for the civilized behaviour of nations towards one another. For a short time after the end of the cold war we believed that we were going through a phase of almost exclusively positive changes and upheavals. Democratic Governments were replacing authoritarian regimes  and millions of people were attaining the freedom they had long been denied. But that time was short-lived. Today the international community of States finds itself facing no fewer problems than before. Instead of a diminution  there has been a deepening of the North-South conflict; regional conflicts driven by ethnic  religious  social and cultural differences are coming to a head; and environmental damage is threatening us and future generations. Simultaneously  however  expectations have risen and prospects improved of the United Nations being able to play more fully the role that was envisaged for it when it was established. Liberation from the burden of the big-Power confrontation has indeed made our peoples and nations clearly aware of the world's mutual interdependence  but we are still not of one mind regarding the order in which to list the problems to which the United Nations should devote its priority attention. Quite obviously  the structures of an organization founded 47 years ago need to be adapted to the realities and new demands of these greatly changed times. We therefore welcome the Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  and see it as providing a useful basis for the efforts to improve the capacity of the United Nations to establish and maintain peace in the world. We believe that the proposals regarding preventive diplomacy in particular  contained in section III of the report  need to be looked at very closely with a view to creating means of preventing disputes or limiting their escalation. Internal conflicts have become a special challenge to the community of States. Ethnic  social or religious disagreements often give rise to regional instability. We are aware of the fact that a number of the new States Members of the United Nations  in particular  are in an extremely difficult economic and political situation. Liechtenstein would like in this connection to express particularly its sympathy with the victims of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war unleashed by the aggression of Serbia and Montenegro is causing great human suffering in that country. We are following with deep concern the continuing reports of massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law  for which all parties to the conflict are responsible. The killing of innocent human beings and the destruction of an irreplaceable cultural heritage must stop  and all parties must immediately make efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to their difficult problems. We support the declaration of principles issued on the occasion of the London Conference  held on 26 and 27 August 1992  and the framework established by the Conference participants within which a comprehensive political solution to the crisis is to be sought. We express our hope that the political will demonstrated in London will be transformed into specific actions and that the follow-up negotiations taking place in Geneva will soon yield positive results. It is within that framework that I should like to refer to the initiative that the Head of State of the Principality of Liechtenstein  His Serene Highness Prince Hans-Adam II  introduced in his address to the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. On that occasion His Serene Highness referred to the need to find ways of promoting peaceful solutions to the many conflicts which have their roots in the tensions which exist between communities within States. His Serene Highness considered that such solutions should be sought within the framework of the principle of self-determination. Liechtenstein is aware of the consideration already given within the United Nations and indeed within other bodies - to the principle of self-determination. We acknowledge the great international effort devoted to this question in the past. The right to self-determination as a principle is now universally accepted. I would recall not only that self-determination is one of the foundations of the Charter but also that most States represented in the Assembly are already under certain specific legal obligations in this area by virtue of Article 1 of each of the great human rights Covenants of 1966. There it is formally and with legally binding effect acknowledged that: ""All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic  social and cultural development."" Despite all this  and with some notable exceptions  the practical and peaceful application of that principle has often been lacking. Tensions between distinctive communities within States  or between such communities and the State itself  persist in many parts of the world. Regrettably  they have in a number of instances led to outbreaks of serious violence. Apart from the human suffering which results  such tensions and violence often affect neighbouring States  and may have a more widespread impact on the maintenance of international peace generally. Much can be done to try to limit the suffering once the violence has started; but how much better it would be to go to the root of the problem which is often to be found in the frustrations of distinctive communities when they are denied the legitimate expression of their communal identities and aspirations. I am glad to say that His Serene Highness's statement last year attracted the interest of a number of delegations. During the past year we have undertaken extensive consultations  and we have benefitted greatly from constructive suggestions which delegations have been kind enough to make. We are most grateful to all those Governments for the interest they have shown. We have also sought  and taken into account  some independent expert views. It is against this background that Liechtenstein believes that the international community  through this Assembly  should take steps to make the right of self-determination more effective  and by doing so contribute to the avoidance of some future conflicts. It is our conviction that the time has now come for the international community  through the United Nations  to offer a realistic way forward  by establishing a practical framework through which communities can give expression to their distinctive qualities. Such a practical framework would need to satisfy four main requirements: First  there should be flexible and graduated forms of self-determination involving different levels of autonomy  taking account of the differing needs of differing communities and the States of which they form part; a subdivided community which allows its various parts to pursue the common goal in their own way can on occasion be a very good expression of the principle of self-determination;  Secondly  communities invoking the principle of self-determination should renounce resort to violence and commit themselves to pursuing their aims through peaceful means only; Thirdly  assistance in the effective realization of the principle of self-determination should be available through independent procedures; and Fourthly  a proper balance must be maintained between self-determination and the territorial integrity of States. Subject always to those requirements being met  we believe that the international community should recognize that self-determination is an inherent attribute of all communities which possess a distinctive social and territorial identity. This involves the free choice by each community of its political  social  economic and cultural destiny in accordance with the best interests of its members. Self-determination  it must be stressed  is not necessarily or even primarily a matter of moving towards independent statehood. Indiscriminate independence would lead to the fragmentation of the international community and would insufficiently respect the territorial integrity of States. In reality  however  full independence is  if only for purely practical reasons  the least likely outcome in most cases. Respect for diversity can be adequately reflected in other ways. Self-determination can take various forms  as may be best suited to each community's and each State's particular circumstances. It is important to retain the essential flexibility of the concept. But in all cases where there exists a community with a sufficient degree of distinctive identity  it seems right that a certain basic level of autonomy should be acknowledged. I am referring to such very elementary matters as non-discrimination against the community or its members  their freedom to practice and enjoy their distinctive community characteristics  and their participation in appropriate ways in public affairs  particularly in matters directly affecting the community's interests. A commitment to acknowledge such a modest degree of autonomy for all communities that merit it should not  we believe  cause serious problems for any Member of the United Nations. More advanced levels of autonomy will be appropriate for communities whose particular circumstances demonstrate their fitness to enjoy them. But we do not think it would be realistic for the United Nations to seek to lay down detailed mandatory requirements for the self-determination of communities with a vast range of distinctive characteristics  settled within States whose own histories are so diverse. Anything beyond the sort of basic level of autonomy to which I have referred is probably best left to be developed on an optional basis and case by case the circumstances being so diverse that each is best left to be treated on its own merits. Nevertheless  there would  in our view  be some advantage in the United Nations indicating the kinds of further elements which might find a place in the more advanced levels of autonomy. These further elements of autonomy would progressively add to the degree to which the community conducts its own affairs but would only be available to a community with satisfactory experience and even then  only if the State concerned is ready to accept the community's more advanced level of autonomy.  In this complex area we cannot assume that any general principle or procedures which might be agreed internationally will be applied without difficulty in particular cases. We should therefore also envisage that some procedures be available to assist if any difficulties arise in the application of the principle of self-determination and to assist with the peaceful resolution of any differences there might be. A number of delegations with which we have discussed our ideas in general terms suggested that it would be advantageous for the matter which  as well as being of great political importance  is also of considerable technical complexity - to be the subject of some further examination by a group of experts so as to facilitate the progress which may eventually be made in this Assembly. We have accordingly concluded that the most appropriate course will be for the Government of Liechtenstein to invite each Government represented in the Assembly and that includes those here as observers to nominate an independent expert to attend an informal meeting of experts in Liechtenstein next March. We hope that the experts attending that meeting will be able to assist us in further developing the ideas advanced initially by His Serene Highness at the forty-sixth session of the Assembly. We envisage that the experts nominated to attend will do so in their personal capacities  since we believe that by adopting procedures which avoid committing Governments we are more likely to have a constructive and expert discussion. Invitations to nominate experts to attend the meeting will be issued during the course of the present session. In the light of the views expressed at the meeting of experts  the Government of Liechtenstein will consider how best to return to the Assembly  perhaps at its next session in 1993  with proposals for carrying further the initiative introduced last year by His Serene Highness. As the international community makes progress  however haltingly  towards preventing the outbreak of violent conflicts between States  it becomes all the more important that together we seek ways of avoiding the no less inhuman consequences of civil wars between communities within a State. In informing the Assembly of the lines along which our thinking on this important and sensitive matter is developing  I hope that I may have demonstrated the depth of our concern that some way should be found of controlling one major source of much violence and human suffering in today's world. May I express my hope that the new spirit of cooperation in the United Nations will help enable us to discharge the responsibility entrusted to us and to find  in consensus  solutions to the manifold problems that we face. My delegation is ready to make its contribution in order to achieve  in efficient cooperation with other delegations  the objectives of the United Nations. "
"94",4164,"LKA",47,1992," The delegation of Sri Lanka congratulates Mr. Stoyan Ganev of Bulgaria on his election as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We assure him of our full co-operation and support. We wish to record our deep appreciation of the determined manner in which his predecessor. His Excellency Samir S. Shihabi  conducted the affairs of the forty-sixth session and of the keen interest he took in moving forward the process of revitalization of the General Assembly. We welcome the new Member States and wish them every success in their legitimate national and international endeavours. It is my special honour to convey to the General Assembly the greetings of the President of Sri Lanka  His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa  and his sincere good wishes for the efforts of the United Nations to ensure a just and peaceful world. The cold war is over. Momentous developments continue to dominate the international scene. The consequences of these developments for a peaceful world have yet to fully unfold. New independent States have emerged. The transition to a stable and equitable order is full of uncertainties and challenges. Several peace initiatives to resolve conflicts offer hope. Nevertheless  there is simmering discontent within and among nations. Unrest and turmoil prevail in parts of the world.  The violence in the territories of former Yugoslavia continues unabated. The tragedy in Somalia appals and shames the human conscience. The peace processes that began in Afghanistan and Cambodia have encountered setbacks. In South Africa a non-racial and democratic Government is yet to be established. The question of Palestine still remains on our agenda. We hope that the Middle East peace process will enable that troubled region to soon enjoy the peace for which its peoples yearn. We thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization in these and other areas of activity during the year. The Secretary-General's report on an ""Agenda for Peace"" is innovative and challenging. The proposals in his report must be considered with the care and seriousness they deserve given the instabilities that prevail and the uncertainties that lie ahead. The central focal-point for any action in this regard should be a revitalized and democratized United Nations. The Secretary-General himself has observed that ""the foundation stone to this work is and must remain the State"". The fundamental sovereignty and integrity of the State are crucial to any common progress we seek to achieve. Preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and post-conflict peace building must be pursued in a manner that meets the legitimate aspirations of all Member States. In keeping with the principles of universality and sovereign equality  the post-cold war peace process must encompass and involve all Member States. This is fundamental to the legal and moral authority of the United Nations. The General Assembly should continue to be the principal policy-making body of the Organization. We support all efforts to ensure more effective functioning of the General Assembly as a forum of multilateral diplomacy to achieve our common objectives. The role of the United Nations in conflict prevention and conflict resolution should be pragmatic. It should contribute to the stability and long-term viability of the international system. The Secretary-General has reminded us that unlimited ""fragmentation"" of sovereign entities would make it more difficult to achieve peace  security and economic well-being for all. External intervention in any guise cannot be justified  except in accordance with the provisions of the Charter  particularly in cases where domestic solutions have not been entirely exhausted. To ensure the efficacy of our collective efforts towards fulfilling the ""Agenda for Peace""  it is imperative that the United Nations assume a decisive role in formulating and putting into effect an ""agenda for development"". Lasting solutions can be found only through enlightened development-cooperation policies pursued in tandem with strategies for preventive diplomacy. As the principal organ entrusted with the maintenance of international peace and security  the Security Council now functions without the shackles that made it ineffective during the cold war. However  its present configuration continues to reflect the realities of the immediate-post-war power structure. The Security Council could be made more representative. It is important that its procedures be democratic and transparent. Its decisions should reflect consensus  arrived at after proper discussion  and respect for national sovereignty. There should be a better balance in the relationship between the General Assembly and the Security Council. The restructuring of the United Nations in its economic and social areas has already begun. There is a need for better coordination of global economic policies and for more effective policy-making and policy-implementation. Coordination and integration of operational activities of the specialized agencies and other bodies  functioning under the Economic and Social Council  and strengthening of the field presence of the United Nations have become vital. This will reduce duplication  inefficiency and a too-diffused focus of United Nations assistance. The ultimate aim of the reforms must be to enable the United Nations to be more effective in the promotion of development cooperation for social and economic progress. However  in our enthusiasm to reform the United Nations in the social and economic fields  we must maintain the principles of democracy  universality and respect for the sovereignty of States. We wish to commend the Secretary-General for his bold initiatives in streamlining the work of the Secretariat. We hope that continuing efforts to maximize efficiency in the Secretariat will not diminish  but will enhance  the capacity of the United Nations to respond to the pressing socio-economic needs of the developing world. We welcome the Secretary-General's efforts to reorganize the Secretariat and to utilize fully its human resources. These efforts should be matched by Member States' meeting their obligation under the Charter to make available the required financial resources. If the present financial crisis of the United Nations is to be resolved  these resources must be provided on time. This year has witnessed a reaffirmation  by the nations of the Bon-Aligned Movement  of the validity and relevance of non-alignment and of its basic approach in addressing international problems and development. The tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  held in Jakarta last month  emphasized the need to build a new and equitable international order based on political and economic democracy both within and between nations. The Jakarta Message conveys a clear consensus that the Non-Aligned Movement is not a captive of its nomenclature  which reflects the historical context in which the first Summit Conference took place. In our commitment to promote and preserve the ""dignity and worth of the human person"" we believe that the best defence of human rights lies in democracy and openness in societies. For over half a century Sri Lanka has had a proud record of uninterrupted universal adult franchise and respect for the electoral verdict. My country is a party to the Covenants on human rights. In Sri Lanka  steps are being taken to establish a human-rights commission to strengthen the fulfilment of our constitutional obligations relating to fundamental rights. We have an enduring commitment to both national and international accountability. Sri Lanka's policy of openness and of cooperation with national and international bodies in the field of human rights is derived from democratic traditions and institutions that are an integral part of Sri Lanka's value system. Socio-economic aspects of human-rights problems have found their manifestations everywhere. This is evident from violent and undemocratic expressions of grievances in both developing and developed countries. We believe that a cooperative rather than a coercive approach would help international action to achieve the desired results in the field of human rights. Sri Lanka will participate constructively in the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 to develop such a positive approach to the promotion of human rights world-wide. International peace  security and development are indivisible. It is no longer possible to conceive of security essentially in military terms. The cold-war era  in which a highly militarized concept of security dominated East-West relations  is over. Today  socio-economic factors have become major determinants of global security. Multilateral disarmament and world peace and security are inextricably linked. This makes it necessary for the United Nations to play the central role in global disarmament. The United Nations should also be a catalyst in facilitating regional disarmament. The monitoring of the illegal arms trade and its elimination should be a priority on the multilateral agenda on disarmament and conflict prevention. The illegal arms trade and the highly destructive evils of drug trafficking and terrorism are interlinked and mutually supportive. States should not permit their territories or their citizens to be used for the perpetration of acts of destabilization against other States through support for  or tolerance of  arms smuggling drug trafficking and terrorism. Multilateral action to address these real threats faced by democratic societies should constitute an indispensable element of the peace agenda of the United Nations.  Sri Lanka strongly supported multilateral negotiations aimed at a total prohibition of the entire chemical weapons cycle. The successful conclusion of the convention on chemical weapons demonstrates the competence of the United Nations in multilateral negotiations. Sri Lanka was among those countries which signified an early interest in becoming an original signatory to the convention. We hope that States parties to this convention will promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of chemicals in accordance with its letter and spirit. Efforts to establish a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean continue. In view of the changing international situation  the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean was of the view that the General Assembly might wish to consider alternative approaches. The Tenth Non-Aligned Summit Meeting in Jakarta took cognizance of this view and reiterated the determination to continue efforts to achieve the goals of the Declaration as considered at the meeting of littoral and hinterland States held in 1979. We hope that the new spirit of cooperation evident elsewhere in the world will embrace the Indian Ocean region as well. My delegation is pleased with the conclusions reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro. We endorse the principles enunciated in the Rio Declaration  the programmes in Agenda 21  the commitment to a shared partnership by the provision of adequate new and additional funding and the transfer of the necessary technologies to developing countries. Sri Lanka has signed the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. We expect that the creation of a commission for sustainable development will without delay move forward the process of ensuring the sustainable development to which all nations and peoples committed themselves in Rio de Janeiro. The United Nations must take a visionary perspective in shaping the future of a world already transformed into a global village by modern technology. Yet  developing countries are still in a disadvantaged position owing to the non-availability of the necessary technologies. Among these  space technology is useful in the monitoring of the changing global environment and can assist developing countries in maximizing the use of their resources. However  the high cost of space and other advanced technologies prevents developing countries from reaping their potential benefits. The United Nations and its specialized agencies must therefore work to ensure equitable access to these technologies so that the benefits can be shared by all. This will enable the development of a new regime of technological democracy. The Convention on the Law of the Sea was signed 10 years ago. The Preparatory Commission continues to labour painstakingly to ensure that the resources of the seas and oceans a common heritage of mankind will be used for the benefit of all. We welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General to bring about universal participation in the Convention. In different parts of the world regional organizations are being strengthened. Sri Lanka hid the honour this year to be elected as Chairman of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC). The dynamic leadership of His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa  President of Sri Lanka  has significantly moved forward cooperation among the seven States members of SAARC on a number of initiatives. A South Asian Commission on Poverty Alleviation  established this year  will enable fresh approaches to be taken on the basis of shared experiences in alleviating poverty in our populous region. Sri Lanka's own approach has been to provide opportunities and access to the poor to participate actively and productively as partners in national development  rather than being treated as passive recipients of charity. A South Asian Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA) seeks to promote trade and commerce among SAARC countries. Efforts to expand cultural exchanges and to enhance people-to-people contact at various levels are under way. Regional recognition has been granted to the SAARC Chambers of Commerce and Industries. The Second SAARC Ministerial Conference on Children in South Asia was held in Colombo in September. The Conference resolved to set up several goals and a time frame for their achievement. The specific goals deal with education  child-welfare and children's rights. SAARC is also looking forward to promoting mutually beneficial cooperation with other regional and international organizations. This has been a year of heightened activity in the SAARC region. The countries of our region are determined to maintain this momentum. In this context I quote the words of our President  His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa: ""A sense of innovation must animate SAARC cooperation. We cannot remain static. Fresh and imaginative approaches are needed. We have to face new challenges. New ways have to be found to deal with old problems that have lingered  defying solutions. ""We in South Asia  have the ability to forge together a unity based on our ancient ties. Let us accept the challenge to build together a solidarity of mutual respect; one which will strengthen each individual nation in its independence. A solidarity which will weld our nations into a purposeful and dynamic unity. We will be then be able to face with confidence our common future"". These sentiments are a beacon for regional cooperation in South Asia. In meeting the challenges that lie ahead it is abundantly clear that the United Nations offers the best hope for humankind. The strong and the weak  the rich and the poor  the industrialized and the developing are all represented here. It is only through our deliberations that the problems of our world come into global focus and solutions can be provided accordingly. For the first time after the Charter of the United Nations was signed in San Francisco  47 years ago  the peoples of the world through their representatives here assembled have it in their power to provide new directions for ensuring peace  security  prosperity and social justice in keeping with today's realities. The challenges are many; equally  the opportunities are great. We owe it to the millions who crave equity and justice and a better life in larger freedom that we shoulder our responsibilities with courage and perseverance. We cannot afford to falter or fail. We must succeed."
"95",4206,"LSO",47,1992,"On behalf of the Lesotho delegation  and on my own account  I wish first and foremost  to congratulate you. Sir  on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is indeed a deserved acknowledgement of your personal attributes  as well as eloquent recognition of the important role that your country has always played in world affairs. I cannot but also seize this opportunity to express our appreciation to Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia for the dedication and competence with which he conducted the deliberations of the forty-sixth session.  We are proud to see at the helm of our Organization an eminent son of Africa  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. We warmly congratulate him on his well deserved election to the office of Secretary-General. His achievements to date are a source of satisfaction and pride to us all. We share in the joy of welcoming to the family of nations all the new Member States. Their presence within our ranks is a further fulfilment of the principle of universality of the United Nations. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly has begun against a backdrop of renewed confidence in the ability of the United Nations to facilitate the resolution of a vast array of problems facing humanity. Thanks to the demise of the cold war and the debilitating Power-bloc politics of old  the inherent dynamic of the United Nations has been unleashed  giving reason for optimism that the Organization is now poised to assume a major role in shaping the new world order. Even as the main elements of the new order begin to crystallize  their attendant uncertainties necessitate that we duly voice some of our primary concerns and desires regarding international relations in the post-cold-war era. It is our firm belief that the socio-economic and political transformation the world is undergoing will not culminate in a better and safer world unless it is guided by the ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and unless we acknowledge that  diverse as mankind is  its fundamental interests are common and indivisible. Without our being complacent  it can be said that  with the ideological antagonism of the past now overcome  never before in the history of international relations has such a congenial atmosphere prevailed for collective action towards creating a secure and viable future for mankind. One positive development in this connection is that  increasingly  there is among States  large and small  a happy convergence of shared values and ideals for a better world. It is in this spirit that we should focus undivided attention on the problems confronting the world. Potentially disruptive to the new world order and to the cohesion of nation States is the resurgence of the phenomenon of intolerance  which is assuming prominence in many parts of the globe. Intolerance  whether manifested through racism  religion or ethnicity  breeds discrimination and is a negation of civilized norms and a threat to world peace. Optimistic as we are that a new world order will bring about an enlightened approach to inter-State relations  small States have no option but to continue to emphasize the centrality of the principle of sovereignty and equality of States. Tendencies towards domination and hegemony are still a factor to reckon with  hence our concern with the issue of the security of small States. Equally  we cannot fail to register the lingering perception on the part of developing countries  particularly small States  that the post-cold-war era can potentially lead to their political and economic marginalization. We trust that a matter of such importance as this will evoke an appropriate response on the part of the international community in the period ahead. The new world order we are striving to build will remain on a shaky pedestal unless it places at the centre issues relating to the dignity of the human person. Happily  there is already a global consensus acknowledging that democracy and respect for fundamental human rights are a starting-point for international stability and a foundation for a world free from national and regional conflicts. It is in this context that we hail the decisions of the Assembly to convene in the not-too-distant future international conferences on human rights  on women and on development. The clarion call of the moment is for countries of the world to create truly democratic societies. We note with satisfaction that many countries in Africa are increasingly embarking on that road. In the case of Lesotho  arrangements are very advanced towards holding the first genuine democratic elections since Lesotho attained independence in 1966. It may be recalled that the military assumed power in 1986 in order to restore peace  to foster national reconciliation and to set in motion arrangements for a return to democratic rule. We have pledged to return to the barracks and to hand the reins of power to a democratically-elected government. Our commitment in this regard is both unshakeable and irreversible. Furthermore  the military will not be a contestant at the forthcoming multiparty general election. Its primary role will be to ensure that the election is free and fair. To achieve maximum transparency  several countries as well as international organizations have already agreed to send observer missions to witness the process. The cause of restoring democracy in Lesotho has been found worthy of material support and encouragement by many friendly countries  including the United States of America  the United Kingdom  the Federal Republic of Germany  Canada  Sweden  Denmark and Australia. For this we are profoundly thankful. In the same breath  we would also like to express our deep appreciation for the assistance and support received from the Commonwealth  the European Economic Community (EEC)  and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). In keeping with its resolution 46/137 on ""Enhancing the effectiveness of the  principle of periodic and genuine elections""  the United Nations has provided highly valuable assistance through the Geneva-based Centre for Human Rights. It goes without saying that in the wider context Of the democratization process  the holding of democratic elections is but the beginning. The vital test will be to sustain democratic rule. Newly-emerging democracies will have to contend with the challenges to stability brought about by poverty and underdevelopment. The efforts of many developed countries in nurturing the seed of democracy will need to be complemented by enhanced resource flows from developed countries to assist developing countries not only to escape from the vicious circle of underdevelopment  but also to institutionalize a culture of democracy. We in Lesotho are about to hand over power to a civilian government against the background of serious socio-economic problems accentuated by a devastating drought engulfing the whole of the southern region. I express heartfelt thanks to all those who responded positively to the Geneva Pledging Conference organized in June by the United Nations and the Southern African Development Community to mobilize international assistance towards mitigating the plight faced by countries of the subregion. We are happy to join many delegations in congratulating the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). Lesotho is in full agreement with the perceptions and conclusions set forth therein. The stability of our subregion remains a source of concern. South Africa continues to be in the grip of violence. While we note that the parties concerned have agreed to resume talks  we urge the South African Government  the liberation movements and all other democratic forces to continue the process of negotiations leading to the creation of a new and democratic South Africa. Similarly  we encourage them to persevere in their efforts to find viable modalities for the cessation of violence. We welcome the recent decision by the Security Council enabling the Secretary-General to monitor violence in South Africa and facilitate the restoration of negotiations. We equally appreciate the recent release of some political prisoners and hope that the remaining political prisoners will be released on schedule as agreed by the parties concerned. Notwithstanding continuing initiatives by the OAU towards conflict management and resolution in Africa  many Africans continue to suffer as a result of internal strife and regional conflicts. We are hopeful that the suffering in Mozambique and Angola will soon be brought to an end. We fully welcome the involvement of the United Nations in the ongoing process towards restoring normalcy  which will give the people of the two sister countries greater hope for the future. The human suffering and political impasse in both Somalia and Liberia deserve urgent attention by the international community. The human tragedy unfolding in those countries is immeasurable. While commending the active role of the United Nations in the resolution of the conflicts as well as in addressing the humanitarian dimension  it appears necessary to extend that role to include the involvement of United Nations peace-keeping forces. We are equally saddened by the senseless carnage in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The problem of Western Sahara is still with us notwithstanding preparations for the deployment of the United Nations Mission to supervise the proposed Western Sahara referendum. We appeal to both Morocco and the Polisario Front to co-operate fully with the efforts of the international community in resolving the question of Western Sahara. Pursuant to the Madrid peace talks  we welcome the ongoing peace efforts regarding the Middle East question. Lesotho remains firm in its belief that there can never be a lasting solution to the problem of the Middle East unless Israel fully recognizes the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and withdraws from all occupied Arab territories. However  we are encouraged to note a promising change of attitude in Israel since the change of Government. Security Council resolution 668 (1990) and the signing of the peace Treaty in October 1991 by all parties to the Cambodia conflict  as well as the joint statement of the leaders expressing full support for that Security Council resolution  gave hope that peace was in sight. We urge all parties fully to respect the peace accords  as well as to comply  without fail  with the terms of Security Council resolution 766 (1992). It is our belief that world security cannot be assured through the threat or use of force or by stockpiles of dangerous weapons. We therefore recognize the validity of preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping as viable constituents of the international security agenda. We cannot lose sight of the now universally acknowledged linkage between peace  security and development. Peace is a fundamental element of human existence. It is a universal ideal  and its achievement a perpetual quest of mankind. On it depend our survival  advancement and happiness.  With the demise of the bipolar structures  the whole world  particularly the developing world  had hoped for bright prospects of strengthening development co-operation through the release of financial  material and human resources hitherto tied up in military expenditures. Regrettably  the issue of the peace dividend did not materialize as anticipated. Instead  the spectre of donor fatigue has contributed to the lessening of interest in bridging the economic gap between North and South. We believe that the only way out of this state of affairs is to reactivate the North-South dialogue in earnest. The perennial problem of external debt remains a constraint to our development efforts. The situation is further compounded by trends towards protectionism and other discriminatory policies in international trade against imports from developing countries. We therefore urge the developed creditor countries to urgently strengthen and broaden initiatives towards debt relief. In good faith  they should also facilitate a speedy conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in a balanced and equitable manner that will reflect the interests of the developing countries. The convening of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  in Rio last June  presented a unique opportunity to us all to reaffirm our commitment to the preservation of the environment. Important international agreements were adopted. The major challenge before the international community is to fully honour and implement the commitments made. The provision of adequate financial and technological resources for the implementation of Agenda 21 is an imperative."
"96",4232,"LTU",47,1992,"Allow me to express to you  Mr. President  and to the free people of Bulgaria my sincere congratulations on behalf of Lithuania on your election to such an eminent post. It is fitting that you  an active participant in the creation of a new Europe  should preside over the deliberations of this Assembly as it seeks to establish the foundations for a revitalized United Nations. The task that confronts us is a result of the many significant changes in the world. Exactly four years ago in Lithuania  in the Cathedral Square of Vilnius  people were beaten because they sought freedom. They had gathered to commemorate the day in 1939 when  the Second World War having already begun  Hitler sold to Stalin the as yet unconquered land of Lithuania with all its people and all their rights. Almost half a century later  in 1988  no more rights had been secured. So on that day  28 September 1988  in Cathedral Square  some staged hunger strikes for the release of political prisoners and others sang songs and demanded freedom for their homeland  while still others attacked with shields and rubber truncheons  beating those that sang.  Such was the struggle for rights and ideas a struggle that needed to be understood and appreciated. And in the international commentary and portrayal of this struggle  there also ensued a battle of ideas for right and truth. Such was the non-violent struggle for liberation waged by Lithuania in the name of independence and universally acknowledged Christian principles unifying the ideas of truth and freedom. A year has passed since that day in September when the Lithuanian flag was raised at United Nations Headquarters. In that year we watched as the Soviet Union - that great totalitarian empire stretching from the Baltic to the Sea of Japan flickered and disappeared  and how that country was replaced in its seat here at the United Nations by a new democratic Russia assuming its predecessor's rights and obligations. We also watched as parallel movements for national independence brought down a small communist empire in the south of Central Europe on the Adriatic coast. And we watched as both of these processes were accompanied by the rather ambivalent sentiments and positions of the Western States that is  of their leaders. The world order is moving in a positive direction we will see less evil yet these changes seem to bring about a nostalgia for the old order to which so many had grown accustomed. Lithuania's position was not one of ambivalence. We supported politically Armenia  Georgia and Moldova and the Muslim nations of the former Soviet Union  proposing peaceful solutions to their problems. We were the first to recognize the independence of Slovenia and Croatia in 1991  and this year we recognized the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. Although this may not have been much  these policies nevertheless reflected a position arising from our own experience and the principles we cherish. And what is that experience? The campaign against us was waged by magical means that perhaps can be best described as communist voodoo politics  in which nothing is called by its proper name. So we learned how to identify these phantoms and shadows and we found that such ghosts  when called by their proper names  soon begin to fade. The evil empire continues to fade away  but it has not vanished altogether. Sometimes quite the opposite appears to be true its spirit is so lively that it just may rise again among us and above us. For this reason  when we call for the condemnation and trial of Soviet communism  when we see and expose attempts to restore the USSR  we are in effect supporting democratic Russia and international peace. Democratic Russia  which condemned the 1940 Soviet annexation of Lithuania and recognized our independence  re-established in 1990  should not refer to the Baltic countries as ""newly emerged"" States. Those officials who continue to promulgate this misnomer do a disservice to the truth and to their country  which is struggling to renew itself  to rise above the lies of the past. This applies also to some other labels and intentions. We do not think  for example  that the Serbian army  operating in neighbouring countries  could be called a ""peace-keeping force""  even if the troops painted their helmets blue. We do not think that such forces  authorized to act both on their own and on neighbouring territory  should unilaterally establish their outposts wherever they please  without the neighbouring country's consent. We think that States and their armies should be called by their proper names. ""Serbia"" and ""Montenegro"" are fine names  appropriate enough for a federation title  so let old ghosts fade away. Defending one State's actions against another under the guise of ethnic protection is dangerous.  specifically if the goal is to politicize what is clearly a legal matter. It is even more dangerous to hide in this way the true nature of military actions. When an assault is called by a more neutral term  such as ""conflict""  this third-party position benefits the aggressor and that position becomes neither objective nor neutral.  Lithuania has experienced this and I think that Lithuania's experience of defending itself with the truth  and by avoiding political entrapments  can be a useful example to others  including the Organization. Lithuania  Latvia and Estonia have a big neighbour where a variety of political forces are vying for power in sectors of society and government. Some elements are democratic  some less so  and others not at all. Those media circles in neighbouring Russia that inherited the characteristic mind-set of the old empire are at present promoting aggressive anti-Baltic sentiments  a substitute ""cold-war"" policy which surfaces in the statements of its officials time and time again. Allow me to share some concepts and statements  emanating from the conservative elements of the Russian Parliament and the Foreign Ministry  which alarm Russia's smaller neighbours. Foreign countries are there divided into two categories: the inner sphere and the outer sphere. Similarly  Lithuanian composer Bronius Kutavicius's musical score for four of the instruments used have the designations of near violin  distant violin  near piano and distant piano. The stage violin is the one that the listener can reach from the front row and thus may feel the inclination to grab as his ""vital interest"". Universal musical harmony is of less concern to him. The 30 June 1992 document of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Russian Parliament recommends this position. The concept is not new; it has been around since the time of Ivan the Terrible. It was used by other States less successfully. The ""inner sphere"" is designated as an extraordinary or special-interest zone. This concept having been defined - and  if necessary a Molotov-Ribbentrop-type pact may be signed military force may be used and the former inner sphere is no longer a foreign land. Then the outer sphere becomes the inner sphere and subsequently a special-interest zone. Territorial expansion continues  and will continue  if resources permit  until no foreign countries at all remain. For those who believe this process of territorial expansionism to be natural the opposite process is quite painful. For this reason attempts are made to block it  to stop the withdrawal of troops from the neighbour's territory; for this reason one must find someone to protect with this army as a pretext not to remove troops. Those politicians like President Yeltsin who think democratically and have a broader perspective  who want to withdraw the army and to normalize relations  are called traitors who do not defend the State's imperial interests. ""Your interests are our interests""  and ""Your rights are our rights""  is said to fellow nationals abroad  especially to those who think that their prime interest and right is the restoration of the order and traditions of the former empire. I take a different view. For example  in my opinion the best interest and natural right of the Russian community in Estonia is to learn a little of the Estonian language and after a few months to acquire Estonian citizenship  according to the law about which there is so much outcry at present. We hear no protest from Lithuanians living in Estonia  and Lithuania does not plan any sanctions against that country. We will not suspend any of our treaties with Estonia and we will not ask the United Nations to impose any sanctions against it. I have not heard that similar actions have been demanded by Israel or Ukraine  although the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation in his statement to the Assembly at this session was also concerned about other nationalities residing in Estonia.  We disagree with the opinion expressed in the Russian periodical Diplomatic Bulletin that a referendum or other type of vote in one State may be regarded as an act of force against another State  with a presumed right of that State to resort to ""reactive measures  and not necessarily ones of an equivalent character"". Such diplomacy is based on the hope that: ""Russia will not be condemned  at least by those nations which at that moment will be directing their planes towards a Libya or an Iraq"". These are words uttered in August 1992  but they sound as if they were uttered in January 1991. When we hear from this very rostrum that it is necessary to use force to protect human rights we immediately begin asking ourselves who is this policeman-defender who comes  let us say  from Russia to Moldova or from Serbia to Bosnia. In Dubrovnik and in Sarajevo he defends his minority rights in very strange ways. It reminds me of an old and macabre dissident joke from the days of Stalin. The first man asks ""Will there be a third world war?"" The second answers ""No  there will not  but there will be such a battle for peace that not one stone will be left on another."" For this reason we would not want to see Russian peace-keeping forces transforming themselves into forces that would impose a Russian peace  a ""Pax Ruthenia""  in the inner sphere of foreign countries. We wish that somebody would remember the human rights of the hundreds of thousands of people deported from the Baltic countries  including the right to compensation  and that someone  possibly the United Nations  would help to raise from the bottom of the Baltic Sea the poisons of the Second World War that were dropped off our shores by the Soviet army. The right of anyone to live on the shores of the Baltic Sea is now in danger. We would like to see the world community help all nations rising from the Red plague and to see the family of nations assist Russia economically and also in its search for democracy and justice. It should be a matter of universal concern that the dead hand of communism should not drag down into its marble mausoleum the entire nation and possibly all mankind. We should resist this danger by upholding other values  not those from the realm of ghosts of the past. Lithuania and the other Baltic States again present a challenge to Russia  and the world will see how it responds. Maybe the economic pressure and measures of an undeclared blockade directed against us are not direct punishment for destruction of the empire or help to our leftist opposition in Lithuania. Maybe these are just the difficulties of Russia itself  although probably not exclusively of an economic nature. We also have these difficulties and thus we know them well. Recently signed bilateral agreements on the withdrawal of the Russian armed forces from Lithuania give us hope. These agreements were welcomed by the democratic world and a multitude of people of good will. I do not doubt that the United Nations will urge that such agreements should also be signed between Latvia and Russia as well as between Russia and Estonia. Moreover  the process of withdrawal of the armed forces should be carefully monitored in order that the four States may as soon as possible achieve normalization of their relations under conditions of security  prosperity and friendship between all the nations of the region. I thank you  Mr. President  for the opportunity to express that hope. In conclusion  I should like to say a few words about United Nations structural reforms. These reforms are also tied to our experience. When a large State pressures and accuses a small neighbour  the latter should find support here  at the United Nations  which is duty-bound to defend small States. Changes in representation could be made  such as establishing a Group of Small European States at the United Nations with its specific vision of global problems and shared concern for preserving national identity. Perhaps that ""Little Europe"" could initiate a solidarity movement in behalf of small States around the globe. The Security Council could be expanded to include three new permanent members - Japan  Germany and India and the exercise of the right to veto from that day forward could require not one but at least two permanent members' invoking that right at the same time. I respectfully request that these ideas be included in the ongoing debate of ideas being considered at the United Nations. "
"97",4276,"LUX",47,1992,"At the outset I should like to convey to the President of the General Assembly my heartiest congratulations on his unanimous election. He is one of the principal architects of the advent of democracy and profound change in Bulgaria. I am certain he will guide with skill and efficacy the work of the General Assembly  which I hope will carry on resolutely in the reform of its programme and its working methods. To our new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  I should like to express the great pleasure of the Government and people of Luxembourg on his election to head our Organization. The decisions he has taken and the proposals he has put forward since the beginning of the year make it fitting for me to pay tribute to him for his lucidity  courage and resolve to make of the United Nations an organization that is capable of answering the challenges of our time. I welcome the representatives of the 13 new countries that have joined the United Nations since the beginning of this year  bringing the number of Members to 179. Last Tuesday my colleague Douglas Hurd put forward the positions of the twelve member States of the European Community concerning the major problems that confront the international community at present. Clearly  I subscribe to everything that was said by the representative of the State which occupies the presidency of the Council of Ministers of the European Community  so I shall limit myself to stressing several issues that are of particular concern to the Government and people of Luxembourg. Two tragedies giving rise to the utmost concern are occurring at present. I refer to the famine in certain parts of Africa and to the civil war in Yugoslavia. Both of these show once again that the international community's right to humanitarian interference in regional conflicts can no longer be called into question. The famine in Africa threatens the lives of an extraordinarily large number of human beings  and it must immediately be at the focus of our attention. We are confronted  on one hand  by an overwhelming drought  that has afflicted all of eastern and southern Africa and  on the other hand  by the lack of organization in the production and distribution of foodstuffs that has resulted from civil wars. In the Sudan and in Somalia  the European Community has continued  over the last few months  to intervene with the parties involved to ensure that those parties will allow and guarantee the distribution of international food aid. It is indeed outrageous that a government or armed factions should interfere with this operation. I am glad that our Organization has sent military forces to Somalia to guarantee food distribution. My country is contributing to all these efforts by providing financial assistance which  per capita  is among the greatest in the world. We believe that the United Nations should consider what measures it might undertake to ensure that famine is no longer used as a weapon in the civil war raging in the Sudan. The continuing tragedy in Yugoslavia is of the most profound concern to the people of my country. Unfortunately we are witnessing a resurgence of most of the criminal practices of nazism  including even the horrendous ""ethnic purification"" applied to persons from a different sociological group. The problems raised by the presence of minority populations in the republics of the former Yugoslavia cannot be resolved by military intervention; they can be resolved only through negotiated arrangements modelled on those proposed in November 1991 by the European Community. I make a solemn appeal to all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia to support energetically the efforts of those leaders who wish  fully  unreservedly and without any hidden agenda  to implement the measures defined at the London Conference on 26 and 27 August. Only in that way can peace and prosperity be re-established. Only on that basis can an equitable solution be found to the problem of nationalities or minorities the problem that gave rise to this conflict  just as it was at the basis of the bloodshed which  unfortunately  continues in certain areas of the former Soviet Union. With regard to this extremely complex problem  I should like to make some further observations. As the representative of a small country that owes its existence to the principle of self-determination  I am clearly not in a good position to deny this right to other peoples. However  I must make the point that  where several types of population are closely linked  the application of  this principle is not sufficient to resolve the problem of nationalities As we have seen  it can serve as a pretext for attempts at conquest and at the annexation of territory  as well as at the forcible expulsion of minority populations  and even the extermination of such peoples. The solution to the problem of minorities can be based only on the following principles: rejection of the idea that frontiers can be changed by force; the granting to national minorities of special status ensuring respect for their ethnic  cultural  linguistic and religious identities; the adoption of arrangements for cross-border cooperation to enable these minorities to maintain close contact with their compatriots in neighbouring countries. In this respect  it seems to us that Italy's solution for the Haut Adige/South Tyrol is exemplary. The establishment  by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  of the machinery of rapporteurs for human rights  as well as the post of commissioner for minorities  should make possible the early identification of potential nationality conflicts and the search for means of prevention. It seems to me that the world conference on human rights to be held next year in Vienna could provide the appropriate framework for an attempt to define certain fundamental rights of minorities and  if possible  to codify them in a new legal instrument. If it were possible  in addition  to establish machinery for an independent forum to verify  at the request of a wide group of people  respect for these minimum rights through the legislation of a given country  that would help to avoid armed conflicts in the future. In the last analysis  the problem of minorities can be resolved only if all peoples living in a territory can be made to feel that they belong to one  family so that they put emphasis on that which unites them rather than on that which divides them. It was united action rather than division that enabled the European Community to secure a new instrument the Maastricht Treaty for the purpose of pursuing their policy of integration  but with respect for national identities. In this regard  I should like to welcome the decisive step that the people of France took by saying ""Yes"" to the Maastricht Treaty  which my country ratified two months ago. Luxembourg has always been in the vanguard of European integration. From experience it knows that the key to its wellbeing and its security lie in the Community and that only together with its partners can it exercise its sovereignty fully. With regard to the problems of the Middle East  we are very gratified at the more conciliatory spirit motivating the new Government of Israel  at the gestures that have already been made by that Government  and at the willingness expressed by the Syrian authorities to conclude a peace agreement. It must be understood  of course  that negotiations for the establishment of an interim regime in the occupied territories can in no case come up with a result short of the Camp David Accords. With regard to Iraq  we continue to demand that the existing regime implement all Security Council resolutions as rapidly as possible. The Iraqi Government bears full responsibility for the deterioration of the humanitarian situation in particular  because it has not yet implemented resolutions 706 (1991) and 712 (1991). Iraq must cease all military action and all other repressive measures against the civilian population. In South Africa  the halt of the work of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) has been most disappointing for my Government. Together with our European partners  we call on all the parties concerned to resume it as soon as possible in a constructive spirit. The problem of violence can be solved only if the police show restraint and if all political movements give categorical instructions to their members definitively to renounce the use of force. I congratulate the Security Council on its resolution 772 (1992) of 17 August  which allowed for the sending to South Africa of a number limited  it is true of United Nations observers to examine ways to strengthen the machinery for the transition towards a non-racial democracy. I must obviously express our views concerning the work now going on within the United Nations. First  I should like to express to our Secretary-General my full appreciation of his excellent report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  which he presented at the beginning of the summer. It contains important proposals on preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. The new international political situation is favourable for stronger United Nations action  which I hope to see  particularly in the following three areas. The first is preventive diplomacy  which would assist us in anticipating and avoiding the outbreak of new conflicts. Would it not help the proper management of international affairs to ensure more active and systematic use of the various means for such diplomacy? The Secretary-General has a crucial role to play in this respect. We could also make better use of the potential of the International Court of Justice to resolve disputes between States. The second area is that of the make-up and functioning of a genuine system of collective security. The United Nations must be in a position when necessary to act very quickly  especially in cases of aggression or threats of aggression by one country towards another. To do this it must have available at very short notice the necessary human and material resources. Certain countries I mention in passing  France and the United States - have already responded very positively to the invitation in this regard by our Secretary-General. The third area is that of the means for establishing peace. Unfortunately  all too often the diplomatic action of our Organization  sometimes in cooperation with regional organizations  such as the European Community  is not followed up. Too many cease-fires have been broken recently  too many embargoes on the delivery of weapons have been violated  for us to remain indifferent to such flouting of international law. Never before has the United Nations made so many tangible contributions to the cause of peace and reconciliation throughout the world. Nothing emphasizes the new credibility and effectiveness of our Organization more than the dramatic increase in its peace-keeping operations in recent years. Thirteen such operations were carried out before 1987. Thirteen have been launched since 1987. The United Nations is now ensuring the implementation of peace agreements in El Salvador  Angola and Cambodia. It is contributing to calming the serious conflicts in Somalia and Yugoslavia. At present in Cambodia and Yugoslavia the United Nations is carrying out two of the most important operations in its history  involving a total of more than 40 000 personnel  both military and civilian. The growing diversity of the tasks entrusted to our Organization highlights its ability to adapt to different situations. Today the United Nations is disarming adversaries and gathering and destroying weapons; reforming governmental institutions which are not up to their tasks; repatriating refugees; clearing mines; monitoring elections and respect for peace agreements and human rights agreements; and providing humanitarian assistance and aid to refugees. It is an honour for my Government to be able to contribute to the United Nations Protection Force in Yugoslavia  admittedly modest in absolute numbers  but nevertheless representing 10 per cent of my country's army. The cost of peace-keeping operations has considerably increased  and their importance demands that there be not the slightest delay in payment. The United Nations must be in a position to prepare  launch and carry out such operations on a sound financial basis. The establishment of a revolving reserve fund would substantially strengthen that basis. Meanwhile  all countries must agree to meet their financial obligations without delay. At its last session our Assembly adopted a resolution (resolution 46/36 L) concerning the establishment by the United Nations of a universal and non-discriminatory Register of Conventional Arms. Luxembourg hopes that during this session the technical procedures required can be determined and that the Register will become operational by the beginning of next year. The United Nations will thus be making an important contribution to the necessary global transparency in arms transfers and to the vast disarmament movement  which must continue. I welcome the agreement reached last June between President Bush and President Yeltsin concerning a drastic new reduction in strategic nuclear arsenals. The forthcoming conclusion of negotiations concerning a Convention on chemical weapons marks a fundamental step in the international effort to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction. I hope that all members of our Assembly will approve the Convention without reservation and will immediately sign it. Our Assembly has recorded significant progress on the basis of another initiative of the European Community. This relates to the measures decided on to strengthen United Nations coordination in the area of emergency humanitarian assistance. The creation of the post of Emergency Relief Coordinator  to which Mr. Jan Eliasson was appointed  and the establishment of a central revolving fund of $50 million now enable the United Nations to cope more effectively with humanitarian crises. Luxembourg welcomes the broad democratization movement developing throughout the world. It involves political changes which are often painful  complex and difficult  but they are necessary in order to build a better future. A growing number of Governments involved in such processes are requesting electoral assistance from the United Nations. Given the particular importance of free and honest elections  I believe the United Nations should continue to strengthen its capacity for acting in this area. I also propose that the United Nations cooperate with other international organizations with experience in this field in particular  the Council of Europe. My Government believes that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio  was a historic event. It is true that not all our hopes were fulfilled and that many of the decisions taken lack clarity and courage. But who could deny the importance of the preparatory work and the awareness which it brought about? A world-wide process was launched. Major political commitments were made at the highest level. However  the real battle still lies ahead. The convention on climate change and the convention on biological diversity still must be ratified and implemented; above all  they must be finalized and finely honed. The negotiation of a convention on desertification still remains to be dealt with  and international cooperation on the protection of all forests- which is essential is still undefined. Agenda 21 opens up a vast field of work in all areas of the environment and development. Progress needs to be made in this respect on the national  regional and international levels  with the participation of all players in society and in particular of non-governmental organizations. Poor countries must accept the fact that environmental protection is not a luxury; and rich countries must ask themselves if and to what extent their means of production and consumption are compatible with the demands of sustainable development. The future of the planet cannot be jeopardized by national egoism. My Government has decided to increase substantially the amount of aid earmarked for humanitarian assistance and development cooperation. It is prepared to work together with all those who are interested in promoting human development; transparent and honest management of public affairs; the participation of all  and above all of women  in the development process; and in a general sense  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The tasks.before our Organization are numerous and most significant. A major process of transformation and restructuring lies ahead. Three years from now  we shall be marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. Let us hope that by that time we shall have established a revitalized Organization  one that can effectively shoulder the responsibilities that the peoples of the world are so eager to entrust to it. "
"98",4302,"LVA",47,1992,"Please accept Latvia's congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly  Sir. The people of Latvia wish you a successful term as its leader. Latvia wishes to pay its respects to those nation States which have recently been admitted to the United Nations and looks forward to cooperation with them. More than a year has passed since the Republic of Latvia  with the support of the world's democracies  restored its independence. This past year has been characterized by the renewal of our State institutions. The restoration of independence is a complicated process during which we have learned from our mistakes. Our own experience and that of other nations has contributed to making the transition process more effective. The goal of independent Latvia to become a democratic free market State has not changed. Unchanged also are Latvia's efforts simultaneously to find an optimal solution to two acute and unavoidable problems: the correction of the injustices fostered by the illegal occupation and the protection of the rights of all residents of Latvia. The majority of States never recognized the annexation of Latvia. This was of vital significance for the restoration of our independence. It is only now that we have begun fully to understand the complexity of our situation. The stabilization and development of our independence is largely dependent on the objectivity with which the consequences of the former colonial policies are evaluated and on the manner in which they are eliminated. I would even say that in the recent past the restoration of independence in the Baltic States was of the utmost importance for security and stability in Europe. Today the international appraisal of the consequences of the annexation is just as crucial. A flawed approach to this question  which would legitimize these consequences  could severely destabilize the political situation in Latvia. But now I invite representatives to take a fundamental and unprejudiced look at the consequences of the half-century-long illegal incorporation of Latvia into the Soviet empire. Foreign military troops are still stationed on the territory of Latvia. Moreover  the Latvian Government has been denied the right to monitor these forces. The lack of control over this army  its sometimes chaotic demobilization  and its wilful and covert merging with economic enterprises and civil institutions in Latvia  create the threat of unsupervised arms transfers  even to international markets. Today there is no other nation State in the world with as many active or retired military persons per civilian as in Latvia. Our small nation has been pressured to provide social guarantees  including living accommodation  to the military forces of a great Power upon their withdrawal from Latvia. Meanwhile  Latvians who were deported to Siberia on a mass scale in 1941 and 1949 are still unable to find housing in their homeland. Latvians who fled to the West as a result of oppression by the former occupation regime  and who now wish to return to their native land  are also unable to find accommodation. The great neighbouring Power also attempts to determine the political basis of our State the composition of its body of citizens. We welcome the adherence of the Russian Federation to the Helsinki Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  particularly paragraph 15  in which the participating States committed themselves to end the ""stationing of foreign armed forces on the territories of the Baltic States without the required consent of those countries."" (A/47/361. annex  para. 15) In our turn  we can affirm the willingness of Latvia to see that the commitment expressed in this paragraph is fulfilled in our negotiations with the Russian Federation. Unfortunately  to date we have not seen similar interest on the part of Russia. It is a matter of concern that the view has been expressed in the Parliament of the Russian Federation that the agreement already concluded on the withdrawal of troops from Lithuania should be annulled. In the negotiations with Latvia  the Russian delegation is constantly changing its position even on matters previously agreed upon. Therefore Latvia  together with Estonia and Lithuania  requested that the issue of the complete withdrawal of foreign military forces be included on the agenda of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Latvia also invites the Security Council to send observers to the negotiations with the Russian Federation  and is looking forward to the other party's consent. Aside from the serious issue of foreign military forces in Latvia  one of the most serious consequences of the annexation of Latvia is the dangerous alteration of the demographic situation as a result of forced migration and the Soviet Union's colonial policies. In the last 50 years no other State has had its indigenous population reduced to the status of a near minority as a result of both immigration and the loss of a large part of its indigenous population during occupations by two criminal regimes. Communist and Nazi. Latvia must now devote great efforts to preserving its State language  the major component of Latvian culture and heritage. Another truth is becoming more transparent. We cannot utilize only existing schemes and models to solve our internal problems. Our unique demographic situation requires us to solve the citizenship question with respect to immigrants on the one hand  to create a secure environment to preserve our national identity  and on the other to give immigrants every opportunity to integrate into Latvia's society while preserving and developing their own languages and cultural traditions. The State of Latvia  of course  is interested in expanding its body of citizens  but not with retired officers of the former Soviet army who  even now  do not recognize the independence of Latvia. There are other States from which the armed forces of the former Soviet Union are being withdrawn but the possibility of granting the citizenship of these States to former Soviet officers has not been an issue. The current domestic debate suggests that the Latvian Parliament adopt a law on citizenship in which the principal criteria for granting citizenship would be a 10-year residency and a basic knowledge of Latvian. Such a law  if accepted by a referendum of citizens  would have legal force. Currently  all permanent residents of Latvia are being registered and are being given the opportunity freely to declare their intention to become citizens of Latvia or to remain citizens of another State which is their country of birth. Furthermore  the laws of Latvia guarantee  according to international standards  each individual's human rights  which quite frequently  consciously or unconsciously  are confused with the right to citizenship. Some political forces in Latvia have requested that decolonization policies be carried out. The notion of a colonized country in twentieth-century Europe may seem strange. However  an examination of evidence provided by 50 years of annexation suggests the possible validity of this notion. When referring to decolonization  in no case do we imply that all immigrants must or will leave Latvia. However  our internal situation requires clarity on the very important question of who must leave Latvia. First  the former Soviet military forces must leave. Secondly  all those foreign citizens to whom the existence of an independent Latvia is unacceptable must leave. Thirdly  those who wish to live among members of a single ethnic group  in Russia or elsewhere  will leave on their own initiative. However  the great majority of immigrants will stay in Latvia  and our desire is that they be integrated into our society. In regard to the protection of human rights in Latvia  we wish to follow examples found in independent and democratic States: the indigenous people  Latvians  should have the same rights as similar groups in other States  whereas minority and immigrant groups should have cultural autonomy  including opportunities to use and develop their language. We reject the accusations  made here by the Russian Federation  that the rights of minorities are being violated in Latvia. We are ready to have our human rights situation examined by experts of the Commission on Human Rights. We are linking our hopes with the experiences of States that have travelled the road of decolonization  and from these States we expect understanding and support. The economic reforms  which have brought good results to many of these States  are very attractive and can be used by us. The situation in the world  especially in Europe  is changing qualitatively. In the past  the world order was dictated by the great Powers or  to be more precise  by military-political blocs created by the great Powers. For better or for worse  this system worked  even if through mutual fear rather than mutual trust. The stated goal of the former world order was the maintenance of world peace and stability. Contradictory or delayed actions are not the best means of increasing stability. The international recognition of Slovenia  Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina was delayed precisely because of such considerations; the tragic consequences of such a delay are still with us today. In international relations there exist problems of yet a different nature  problems related to the unification of nations as well as to the representation in the world community of sovereign parts of a divided nation. The Government of the Republic of China in Taiwan has been created by the tides of history. In our opinion  the international community has been unfair in ignoring this fact. Does not international experience bear evidence that participation in the international community by two sovereign parts of one nation provides an opportunity for a productive dialogue between these parts? The United Nations must pay attention to the problems of both large and small States. In our opinion  the security of small States should be a central concern of the Organization  since there does not exist a balance of power or agreement on goals between small States and their larger neighbours at this time. In my opinion  when discussing the relationships between nations  one must remember that there are neither great nor small nations. A nation is only as great as its will. Large and small States  however  can be equally free even if not equally powerful. We place high hopes in the United Nations. Latvia values highly the documents of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  in particular ""Agenda 21"". We therefore reiterate our proposal  first made at Rio de Janeiro  that a conference be convened in Latvia on the subject of ""Disarmament for Environment"". We ask the United Nations and all States for their support. Latvia is grateful for the support received from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). A UNDP representative now resides in Riga and assists the Latvian Government in the preparation of projects on technical assistance. A matter of great importance to Latvia  from the viewpoint both of respect for our sovereignty and of our capacity to pay  is the determination of the assessment rate for the contribution of Latvia to the regular budget  a rate that will in turn determine our total contribution to the United Nations system. Respect for our sovereignty requires that the assessment be determined on the basis of data accepted by Latvia itself  rather than on data provided by the State Statistical Committee of the former Soviet Union in particular  because it is not and never has been the position of Latvia that it is a successor to the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union. Latvia unequivocally supports the statement adopted at the first summit meeting of the Security Council that the Secretary-General be invited to study methods of strengthening and making more effective the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. We support efforts that will decrease threats to the maintenance of international peace and security and to our own sovereignty. Regrettably  in the presence of the internal instability of large neighbouring States  the security of small States is not guaranteed. Latvia would support the granting of authority to the Secretary-General to use not only diplomacy against aggression but force as well. Of course  it will be necessary to create and approve a legal basis as well as a mechanism for the implementation of such authority. We shall always be responsible to our nation for observing United Nations legal norms and principles. Were we to fail in meeting our responsibilities  we would not excuse ourselves by reference to our limited political experience  nor to our economic problems. It is our hope that no State will use its size or its economic and military power as an excuse for ignoring United Nations standards. Latvia values highly the report ""An Agenda for Peace""  the inspiration for  and author of  which was the Secretary-General. Latvia hopes that United Nations support for the rightful demand to withdraw foreign military forces will be evidence of the good will of world opinion and a good example of preventive diplomacy. "
"99",4349,"MAR",47,1992,"Allow me at the outset to extend to you the congratulations of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco on your election as President of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are confident that your presiding over our deliberations will yield the best of results. I should like to assure you of our full cooperation so as to facilitate your mission and render successful your endeavour  bearing in mind the importance of the items on our agenda in these critical times and taking into account the good relations that exist between our two countries. I should like to commend your predecessor  Mr. Shihabi  Permanent Representative of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for the wise manner in which he conducted the work of our last session at a time of grave crises and rapid developments. I am also pleased to welcome the new Secretary-General of our Organization  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and wish to extend to him our highest regard and assure him of our support for the tireless efforts he has exerted since he assumed his new post at the beginning of this year. We should also like to commend him for the brilliant work entitled ""Agenda for Peace""  which he submitted to the Security Council for its consideration and which our Assembly will have to reflect upon in the coming days. I also wish to pay tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  former Secretary-General of our Organization  and to commend the praiseworthy efforts and successful initiatives he undertook throughout his 10 years in office as Head of the United Nations. Thanks to his wise and skilful handling of disputes between Member States  Mr. Perez de Cuellar earned the sympathy  esteem and cooperation of all. The sensitivity and caring he showed toward the developing countries in defending their rights and interests is highly appreciated. I am also pleased to welcome the delegations of the friendly countries that  in recent months  have become Members of the United Nations. Morocco was among the first countries to extend its recognition to those States  and I am pleased to greet the representatives of Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. We hope that these countries will make progress  be successful and enter into an era of peace and security so as to allow the international community to benefit from their political  intellectual and economic capabilities. The events of the last two years produced radical changes that have put paid to one era in the history of international relations and ushered in a new one  which we are still trying to come to grips with. The ideological  political and economic gap between East from West has disappeared with the ending of the cold war and the emergence of a group of newly independent states which are trying to find a. foothold in the international arena. In the meantime  the other States of the world  large and small  are trying to reassess their positions in the new and unclear political equation of the world. At the same time  attempts are being made to create a new world order of unclear outlines and unknown objectives. Nevertheless  upon reflecting on what is being said from time to time regarding these attempts  one can surmise that the new world order might be based on the principles of democracy  a market economy and respect for human rights. These are principles which  we believe  are quintessentially positive. However  we have certain queries regarding the terms of their application and their real content. Indeed  the world is made up of States and peoples whose political  economic and economic stages of development vary and whose material conditions  natural resources and cultures are vastly different. This fact leaves no room for a mechanical application of the aforementioned principles. Systems that may be appropriate for a developed rich country may not necessarily be suitable for a developing third world country without proper adjustment to its particular circumstances or the assurance that the application of such principle would be beneficial in its case. We fully support scrupulous respect for human rights and believe that no one with any common sense can deny such rights. We believe that human rights issues  in their political context based on respect for individual liberties and the rule of law  will inevitably prevail. In other words  the social and economic aspects of human rights are of far-reaching importance and should be carefully addressed by every State. It is regrettable  however  that the developing countries cannot fully control their economic issues in today's circumstances. Recent economic trends have integrated the economies of all countries into one global entity. That is why the recession that recently hit the economies of some developed countries has had a negative and harmful impact on the economies of the developing world. It has aggravated their debt burdens  reduced the prices of their basic commodities  and compounded their economic and social problems. The integration of local economies in a global framework and the interdependence of societies and interests underline the need for a global dialogue in which we can all engage before a just and equitable new world order can be established.  It is no longer feasible to exclude the overwhelming majority of States from the participation in the decision-making process in relation to issues that affect the entire international community on the political  economic  and social levels. We believe that the United Nations is the best forum in which to conduct such a dialogue with a view to laying the foundations of what the Secretary-General  in his latest report on the work of the Organization  called an international partnership for development based on the principles of equity  sovereignty  common interest  and mutual responsibility. Without such dialogue  it would be difficult if not impossible to ensure the stability of the world economy or to alleviate the difficulties facing the developing countries. Starvation  debt burden  shortages of economic and social needs  and the illegal immigration of the unemployed to the developed world would remain hardships afflicting not only the countries of the South but the countries of the North as well. In saying this  we do not wish to engage in any negative diatribes of criticism or accusations. We simply want to highlight certain facts that should not be forgotten at a time when numerous signs indicate that the formulation of a new world order is at hand. In other words  the North and the South are today linked by mutual interests mere than ever before  and should therefore shoulder their shared responsibilities in a world that is undergoing profound changes. It is in this spirit that we have invited our partners in the European Community to reconsider the traditional approach to their cooperation with Morocco. The understanding with which they have received this proposal is a source of special satisfaction to us. Morocco has long enjoyed a special relationship with the European Community  the framework of which has been made redundant by current and future stakes. Consequently  we are happy that both parties are now convinced that it is in their mutual interest to carry out qualitative and radical changes in their relations through the establishment of a free-trade zone and a partnership in various fields. We look forward to the extension of this kind of positive cooperation to relations between the European Community and the other members of the Arab Maghreb Union so as to open new prospects for a. more balanced and beneficial relationship. The dialogue initiated between the States of South-Western European and the States of the Arab Maghreb Union was an encouraging start in which a climate of mutual understanding prevailed. A series of principles were laid down with a view to enhancing cooperation between the two shores of the Western Mediterranean basin  where traditions of close historical ties have existed for centuries in various fields. We therefore hope that the Five plus Five Group will soon be able to overcome the present obstacles and to resume its dialogue  which we believe will contribute positively to the consolidation of the foundations of stability and cooperation in the region. Morocco firmly believes that the establishment of the emergence of the Arab Maghreb is inevitable and that its setting up on sound and solid foundations is more than necessary and beneficial to the countries of that region  the Mediterranean  and the entire world. This is a conviction that is shared by all peoples of the Maghreb  linked as they are by history  religion  language  and culture. To be sure  the Maghreb Arab Union encountered some obstacles at the outset  as has been the experience of others in similar circumstances. However  we are determined to overcome such obstacles and to move forward with a view to implementing the agreed principles and  in particular  to bring about the economic integration which would revitalize the economies of our countries and reinforce the foundations of our development. Not far away from the Arab Maghreb  the Middle East region continues to be in the grip of tensions which have persisted for over 40 years  as a result of the Palestinian question and the attendant Middle East crisis. However  our consideration of this question at this session is accompanied by certain favourable indications as it takes place in the wake of the ever face-to-face meeting between Arabs and Israelis  in Madrid in 1991  and the subsequent meetings of the parties to the conflict  with participation by the States involved. We welcome this tendency. Morocco has always advocated dialogue  in the conviction that there can be no peace without it. It was in this spirit that Morocco took several initiatives towards that end  both at the Arab summit meetings it hosted and at other international forums. Although the process that was initiated at the Madrid Conference has run into a number of difficulties  recent political changes in Israel are encouraging indications with regard to the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and the land-for-peace principle  as a basis for a settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict. The very fact that dialogue has been initiated is a positive and constructive step which  we hope  will lead to the implementation of the aforementioned principles and thus make it possible to achieve progress towards the desired equitable and definitive solution to these problems. Henceforth  the peoples of the region  who have for too long suffered the vicissitudes of colonialism  instability and cold war will be able  like other peoples of the world  to enjoy a new era of cooperation and prosperity. Another source of concern is the continued state of tension in the Gulf region in the wake of the Gulf war which has left deep scars in the Arab world. We understand the bitterness engendered by that war  just as we appreciate the sensitivities of the peoples and officials in the region because of the tragedies that afflicted them. We also realize the gravity of the decisions which have left the Arab world torn asunder. However  we are convinced that the wisdom and far-sightedness of our brethren will prevail  and that reason will overcome passion in order to allow outstanding problems to be solved and the Arab world to return to solidarity  cooperation and understanding. In this regard  the Kingdom of Morocco  as is its custom  is engaged in sustained efforts to unify Arab ranks and to seek common positions. The events of the past few years in Europe have diverted world attention from the situation in Africa. Thus  a whole continent has been forgotten and marginalized  regardless of its deepening economic crisis  the aggravation of its foreign debt problems and the collapsing prices of its export raw materials. It is regrettable to note that the special session of the General Assembly in 1986 devoted to the economic situation in Africa has not helped the African economies  which since them have noticeably deteriorated. It is equally regrettable that the aid provided to Africa by the developed countries has been limited to meagre humanitarian aid to the victims of natural disasters and other endemic scourges such as famine and drought. The African economic crisis is cause for great concern  as stressed by the Secretary-General  in his latest report on the activities of the Organization (A/47/1). We believe it is the duty of the developed countries to pay particular attention to the problems of development in Africa with a view to rebuilding the foundations of the African economy through a special programme that should be set up for that purpose as has been done recently in the case of Central and Eastern Europe. Morocco  which has always paid particular attention to the problems of our continent  remains faithful to the bonds of brotherhood  friendship and solidarity which bind us to our sisterly African countries. In this context  Morocco wishes to reaffirm its solidarity with the states of Africa  which have been adversely affected and would recall that  despite the difficulties of the Moroccan economy  it earmarks 95 per cent of its international cooperation budget to the assistance of brotherly African peoples. While we welcome the imminent end to a number of African political crises  we are still concerned by the persistence of hotbeds of tension caused by internal problems and by civil wars and their tragic consequences. My country welcomes the recent developments in Angola which have led to a process of accommodation under United Nations auspices following the signature of an agreement between the parties to the conflict. Therefore  Morocco has contributed a national contingent to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II  and hopes that the implementation of this agreement will help re-establish peace and harmony in this friendly country. The international community has been shocked by the Somali tragedy  which is unprecedented in the annals of history. The civil war and tribal rivalries have effectively torn that country apart  destroyed its institutions and its economy and have led to utter anarchy. Furthermore  they have caused a famine that has resulted in thousands of deaths  mainly amongst the very young and the very old.  We are grateful to all those who send humanitarian assistance to the people of Somalia and welcome the decision by the Security Council to dispatch the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) to monitor the situation and coordinate the distribution of humanitarian assistance. We appeal to the international community to continue to send such assistance to this afflicted people. As for South Africa  we have noted with satisfaction the resumption of the dialogue between the Government of Pretoria and the African National Congress (ANC) despite the recurrence of violence and actions of reprisal among brothers. We urge all parties to stop the violence and to show the spirit of tolerance and sense of responsibility which  in the past two years  have helped to overcome many an obstacle. We also hope that the continuation of dialogue on constitutional reforms will lead rapidly to the abolition of apartheid and to the emergence of a multi-racial  democratic and united South Africa. Since the end of the cold war  rising extremism  nationalism and ethnic conflicts in some parts of the world have created hotbeds of tension and violence  the most dangerous of which is Bosnia-Herzegovina. Massacres  the mass killing of innocent people  the terrorization of children and elderly people  the incarceration of civilians in concentration camps and the so-called ""ethnic cleansing"" perpetrated by the Serbian forces are heinous crimes that offend our conscience and are a setback to the international efforts aimed at the elimination of practices which  we thought  had become things of the past. The Kingdom of Morocco strongly condemns those acts and calls upon the international community to stand by the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in preserving their national unity  independence  territorial integrity and cultural identity by resorting to all the coercive measures provided for in the United Nations Charter to force compliance with its decisions on this issue. The recent recommendation of the Security Council to the General Assembly regarding the succession of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should be understood by the two republics of Serbia and Montenegro as notice served on them that they should behave as members of the international community  cooperate fully with the United Nations and desist from their heinous practices and unacceptable behaviour. This year  Morocco has assumed its seat as a non-permanent Member of the Security Council. This happened at a very important juncture  when the tasks and responsibilities of that organ have increased substantially. Morocco  being an Arab and an African nation  spares no effort in coordination with the countries of the two groups in bringing the ‚Ä¢ sensitivities of both groups to the deliberations of the Council. In so doing  Morocco is guided by the desire to give precedence to the logic of dialogue  understanding and persuasion in trying to achieve the best solutions. ! The historic events which have taken place over the past year and altered the course of international relations have prompted the Members of the t Security Council to hold a high-level summit meeting on 31 January 1992 in order to consider the important developments that have taken place on the international scene  to define new priorities for the international community and to devise a strategy aimed at revitalizing the role of the United Nations and reinforcing its effectiveness. The Kingdom of Morocco  represented by His Majesty King Hassan II  took part  along with other leaders of the Members of the Security Council in that high-level meeting. On that occasion  they reiterated their determination to uphold the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law as well as their commitment to the preservation of international peace and security  to disarmament and arms control  and to economic and social development. My country wishes to commend the increasing role of our Organization in peace-keeping operations. That role is reflected in the many successful operations carried out recently throughout the world  operations in which United Nations forces have been able to effect disengagement  stop hostilities and bloodshed and protect people and property. On the basis of the Paris Agreement signed by all parties and endorsed by the Security Council  we hope that United Nations efforts in Cambodia  where the United Nations has mounted the largest and most ambitious peace-keeping operation in its history  will lead to a lasting peace in that country. Morocco takes pride in its participation in the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Angola  Cambodia and Somalia  pride which is equalled only by its commitment to fulfil its international duties and its strong belief in the role of our Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security. In spite of these accomplishments  we believe that some aspects of our Organization need to be reformed if we are to make the United Nations more effective in serving the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of its Member States and to regain the desired balance between its organs.  In this regard  it is inconceivable that while we commend the increasing role of the United Nations in preserving international peace and security  our Organization remains inadequately funded for the achievement of that objective. In his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  the Secretary-General made substantive proposals and recommendations  in particular on preventive diplomacy and peace-keeping  peace-making and peace-building efforts. We firmly believe that those recommendations deserve careful consideration by the different organs of our Organization with a view to their adoption and implementation. The setting up of a new world order requires a new reading of the provisions of the Charter - a Charter which was written in 1945 under circumstances which differed completely from the situation in 1992. Indeed  the number of Member States has increased from 51 in 1945 to 179 Member States today. The political map of the world has underwent radical changes and the centres of power shifted and international economic relations have become more complex. The question of so-called Western Sahara has entered its final phase following the adoption of the United Nations peace plan in 1988 and following the establishment of the cease-fire in September 1991. Since that time  the Security Council has given firm and complete support to the implementation by the Secretary-General and his Special Representative of the settlement plan and of the instructions devised for the organization of the United Nations referendum. In spite of the numerous delays which interfered with the holding of the referendum - something which my country deplores the Kingdom of Morocco has continued to adhere firmly to the settlement plan and to the commitments it has undertaken. Moreover  as underlined by the Secretary-General in his report contained in document S/24464 of 20 August 1992  my country continues to extend its full cooperation to the establishment of the mechanisms envisaged and the implementation of the rules agreed upon with a view to organizing the referendum as soon as possible. In this context  Morocco hopes that realism will prevail over obstructionism and procrastination. Following the progress achieved recently in disarmament and the increased awareness of the international community of environmental issues following the Earth Summit in Rio this year  we should like to express our hope that those positive indications will be consolidated by yet another success. We hope that this will be the start of a process that will rid humanity of the ills that beset it in this  the last decade of the twentieth century. We believe that our Organization should be the catalyst that directs all efforts towards the achievement of such goals. In so doing  we will pave the way for the generation of the next century to live in a world which is worthy of mankind: a haven of peace  tranquillity and prosperity. "
"100",4398,"MDA",47,1992,"Allow me first to convey to you  Mr. President  the heartfelt congratulations of the Republic of Moldova on your election and to wish you every success in performing your important duties. I should also like to take this opportunity to express once again my gratitude and my country's gratitude to the participants in this forum. It was thanks to their support that the Republic of Moldova  more than six months ago  became a member of the great family of the United Nations and is now able  in that new capacity  to add its efforts to those of other States in promoting the noble values and ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. I believe that this lofty rostrum of the United Nations General Assembly is the best place to analyse  even if briefly  the processes and transformations we are witnessing today and to discuss our common problems. Beyond doubt  our civilization is undergoing profound and dynamic changes  and for that reason it is acquiring a new quality  a different content. The collapse of communism  the end of the cold war and the fall of the Soviet empire  followed by the appearance of many new independent States  whose peoples cherish freedom and democracy  are all changes of great importance for the future of mankind. At the same time  we are witnessing a constant deterioration of some global problems  such as the appearance of new regional conflicts which threaten the internal stability of those States and which also affect international security. It is clear that those problems and the solutions to them require the concerted efforts of the entire international community. Accordingly  the United Nations  the most representative international body  has an essential role to play as a universal centre for our collective action. Regarding the revitalization of the United Nations and its restructuring to reflect recent events  I believe that as the guarantor of international peace and stability  the United Nations should expand its efforts for peace by improving its peace-keeping machinery  by stepping up its activities in the field of preventive diplomacy and by working out new  more effective machinery to coordinate actions aimed at enhancing respect for the norms of international law and ensuring the security and interests of small States such as my own country. I am convinced that today  more than ever before the United Nations is capable of resolving the problems confronting the world community. It is through such action that the great principles of the Charter which during the time of the cold war remained merely ideals can be effectively implemented and respected. The United Nations  which in earlier days was a forum for ideological polemics  is now becoming a body for international cooperation  a highly authoritative body inspired by a profound constructive spirit. We are fully convinced that the admission of new States to the United Nations family means a mutual responsibility for them and for the United Nations. The events that led to the incorporation of the Baltic countries Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania following the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact are well known. Following that treaty  which had been imposed by force and has since been declared null and void by the parliament of the former USSR  the territory of my country was annexed and subjected to forced assimilation aimed at making us forget our Latin origins and become part of ""the Soviet people"". The proclamation of our Republic's independence and sovereignty and its admission to membership in this world Organization opened the way to our freedom with due regard  of course  for the strict observance of the norms and principles of law accepted in international practice. It is in that context that I wish to state that our goal is to advance towards a model of social organization in our Republic which will match the high standards developed by mankind in the socio-economic  juridical  political  spiritual and other fields. The year 1991 marked the beginning of the existence of independent States with different socio-political and economic systems in the territory of the former USSR. Each of them is seeking ways and means to build a State based on law and the institutions and machinery appropriate for a market economy. We believe that the international community's support should be conceived and adapted to suit the actual conditions existing in each newly independent country. For that reason  with a view to supporting the specific reforms for the transitional period  the efforts of the United Nations and of its specialized agencies will achieve positive results only if they are coordinated with the socio-economic programmes devised and promoted by those countries. The recent admission of the Republic of Moldova to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank guarantees the success of the reforms and also gives substantial support to our young State  which is firmly committed to a process of democratic development. However  the conflict unleashed in the eastern parts of Moldova is a major obstacle to the promotion of our economic reforms and to the democracy to which we are committed. The pro-communist imperialistic forces constituted by the representatives of the old ""nomenklatura"" the military-industrial complex and the higher echelons of the former Soviet army have unleashed a full-fledged war against the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova in order to separate its districts situated on the left bank of the Dniester. At the same time the creation of guards' units  which also include mercenaries from other States  and the involvement in the conflict of the Fourteenth Army  which is under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Russian Federation  are flagrant violations of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova and of the norms of international law  constituting open aggression against our young State. We believe that this conflict can be resolved at the regional level  but there must also be active participation by the United Nations. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his efforts to end the conflict. Following his initiative  a United Nations mission paid two visits to my country in the last three months to investigate the situation. On 21 July 1992  motivated by a sincere desire to put an end to the hostilities  the President of my country signed with the President of the Russian Federation the Agreement on principles for a peaceful settlement of the armed conflict in those districts of the Republic of Moldova which were involved. The Agreement had some positive effects: there was a cease-fire  as well as a disengagement of the armed forces involved in the conflict. Similarly  because of the presence of peace-keeping forces  human lives have been spared. Nevertheless  the situation is still tense. The imperialistic separatist and pro-communist forces do not comply with their obligations to the letter. They are continuing to consolidate their own positions so that the dismemberment of the trans-Dniester territories of the Republic of Moldova has now become a fait accompli. The constitutionally established juridical and administrative organs of the Republic of Moldova in that area have been forced to leave their premises. Parallel with this  organs of the so-called Moldavi Republic of the Dniester have been set up. In that area  there are frequent violations of human rights. The Moldovan population  in particular the representatives of the local authorities as well as veterans  has been the victim of an extensive campaign of psychological and physical persecution. People who do not support the separatist policy are dismissed and many displaced persons who have returned to their homes have found them occupied by mercenaries. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Agreement  former guards are included in the peace-keeping forces  and this has led to acts of violence against civilians. People living in the eastern districts of the Republic still possess a large quantity of weapons. For the reasons I have described  I emphasize that there is a need for the permanent presence of a group of United Nations observers and also of some human-rights experts in the Republic of Moldova to analyse the situation on the scene. From an analysis of the causes and development of the conflict  we can conclude that one of the factors that have contributed and still contribute to  the destabilization of the situation is the presence of foreign military forces in our territory. We must state with regret that the Moldovan-Russian negotiations concerning the withdrawal of the Fourteenth Army on the terms set for that withdrawal have been hampered by the representatives of the Russian Federation  who are equivocating about the negotiations and consequently about the withdrawal of that army of occupation. Furthermore  assertions to the effect that the Fourteenth Army can act as a guarantor of peace are not justified. It is an army of occupation  which  as recent events have shown  is a permanent source of tension and conflict  and the deployment of so-called peace-keeping forces belies its supposed status of peace guarantor. The technical reasons that have been adduced are likewise inexplicable. If the political will exists  the 4 000 or so military personnel can easily be withdrawn. For the resolution of this matter  we expect much from the democratic forces of Russia  which could demonstrate that country's devotion to democratic values. In the present extremely complex situation it would be very useful to have the support of the United Nations with a view to securing guaranteed political cooperation and a demonstration of genuine political will on the part of those involved  particularly Russia. We are convinced that the universal prestige of the United Nations and your support would make possible the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the Fourteenth Army and an easing of the conflict before it degenerates into a conflagration with unforeseeable consequences. Accordingly  I welcome the fact that one item of the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly is an amendment  submitted by the Republics of Estonia  Latvia and Lithuania  on the complete withdrawal of foreign military forces from the territory of the Baltic States. However  I hope that that problem which  as I have already pointed out  is of great importance to my country will be discussed as part of a wider debate which also deals with the withdrawal of the foreign armed forces now in my country's territory. The Government and Parliament of the Republic of Moldova are aware of the fact that orienting domestic legislation towards international standards in the field of human rights is the only effective means of consolidating the democratic process. The country I represent has acceded to the main international instruments on human rights. The supreme legislative forum of our Republic will soon complete its preparation of the new constitution  and that will greatly enhance the process of building a State based on law and a pluralistic democracy. Peace and cooperation are the two main pillars of the foreign policy of the Republic of Moldova. Accordingly  security problems in my country are very important. Geopolitically  Moldova is a meeting-point between eastern and western Europe. For that reason  we seek to establish friendly  cooperative relations with all States  without belonging to any military bloc. I should like to take this opportunity to convey cordial congratulations to Georgia  to Slovenia  to Croatia and to Bosnia and Herzegovina on becoming Members of the United Nations. We are convinced that only human solidarity can promote democracy throughout the world  put an end to conflicts and stop the violations of internationally accepted norms of behaviour. The Republic of Moldova is deeply devoted to the ideals of freedom  democracy and human dignity  which are the main tenets of its policy. "
"101",4443,"MDG",47,1992,"The General Assembly's choice of Mr. Ganev to lead the work of its forty-seventh session is a worthy tribute to his outstanding qualities and to the role his country  Bulgaria  has always played in international relations. I convey the congratulations of the Republic of Madagascar to him  and on behalf of my delegation assure him of our cooperation. We are grateful to his predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for having accorded the strengthening of the General Assembly's authority the highest priority among his concerns although this did not keep him from discharging his other responsibilities with grace  competence and skill  even in the most sensitive of circumstances. I turn now to our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a member of our National Academy. He is certainly aware of the great regard in which he is held in Madagascar  and we know that his experience  his sense of duty and his humanism are all guarantees of the success of our Organization. In this time of profound change  requiring the involvement of all  we again express our support for and confidence in him. Finally  we address our best wishes to  and welcome  the 13 new Members: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. We are pleased to be able to count upon their invaluable cooperation and to offer them our own in return. When I spoke at last year's session  I mentioned the need for a new charter in referring to the prospects of what was being offered us as the ""new world order"". I will not repeat my conclusion  especially since the declarations adopted by the recent Summit Conference of the non-aligned countries have reinforced the sense that my suggestion  as daring as it may have been  only reflects the aspirations of a fairly significant sector of humanity. I realize nevertheless  in the light of the events of these past 12 months  that it might not seem timely not because it in any way disturbs the conservatives  but because we are unfortunately compelled to yield to the vagaries of the international situation. And we ask ourselves: At what point can we truly speak of the new world order? Shall we call it the new order  the new world order  or the new international order? Are we sure of winning consensus around a concept that can only be the fruit of joint efforts? Indeed  before we talk of order  let us try to look within ourselves and around us! Rare are the developments that cause us satisfaction. To be sure  work on the chemical weapons convention has finally been concluded; the operation in Cambodia seems to be supported by the parties; the international peace conference on the Middle East has shown signs of rather positive developments  in spite of some understandable hesitancy; in South Africa  the recent agreement between De Klerk and Mandela should pick up the broken thread of negotiations in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa; the political situation in Angola  Mozambique  and El Salvador is brightening; democracy is regaining stature and acceptability everywhere; and the Earth Summit in Rio unfolded in the best possible conditions. However  shadows persist. There are instability  human tragedy  and political chaos in many countries; the eruption of a nation and the threat of  an entire people's disappearance in Somalia; violence and massacres in the Balkans; floods of refugees in Africa  especially  in Asia  and even in Europe; deadlock in Cyprus; foot-dragging in Western Sahara; human rights trampled by hatred  intolerance  and xenophobia; monetary and financial crisis in the industrialized countries; and mounting poverty in third world countries. This record  though incomplete  is not very encouraging. In any event  it hardly lends itself to prognostications on what the new world order is to be. We will indeed be able to discourse validly on the subject once we have mastered disorder and political  economic  and social insecurity on the national  regional  and international levels. This finding  whose particular bitterness pains us  should not inhibit our ability to reflect and to judge. Nor can anyone say that we are entitled to hide behind the sense of malaise indignation  even in order to refuse to seek joint solutions  however imperfect  to the problems that we have often created for ourselves. As a Member of the United Nations  and above and beyond any considerations of national interest or ideological affinity inasmuch as ideologies still exist - it is up to us to affirm and constantly reaffirm the central role of our Organization in establishing peace and security  prerequisites for progress and social justice. That is the essence of the 1945 Charter. These will remain the goals of the charter that will need to replace it. That is why the Non-Aligned Movement again took up this theme from a fresh but not unprecedented perspective  so as to apply it to the democratization of international relations and the development of solidarity and equality  not forgetting the promotion of legality. One criticism of the 1945 Charter is that it does not take sufficiently into account the desirable balance between the main bodies of the Organization the General Assembly  the Security Council  the Economic and  Social Council  the Trusteeship Council  the International Court of Justice  and the Secretariat. To each body its own responsibilities and attributes! Each historical era has its own limitations and its own imperatives. Since people continue to call for a comprehensive approach to problems in order to achieve integrated solutions  it is important to take a new  pragmatic look ever respectful of the spirit of the Charter at certain provisions of the Charter. Let us take the special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council: Exercised on behalf of the entire Organization  they arose in the situation that obtained immediately upon the Second World War. Now  the alliance has not survived the victory over totalitarianism. The cold war  which in some sense crystallized and distorted the use of the veto  is now part of history. The same applies to the concept of ""enemy"". Meanwhile  newly independent States and new Member States have called for participation on a more responsible basis and a more equitable allocation of what they see as privileges in fact  the implementation of democratic rules within the Organization. It is therefore not astonishing to hear speak at one point of expanding the Security Council  at another of eliminating the veto right  or at another still of extending or modifying the exercise of that right. One fact remains: the right of veto  as envisioned in the 1945 Charter  is challenged by everyone throughout the world except those who have it. Let us apply the rules of the democratic game  and concede at least one point: the 1945 Charter can and must be revised. It will still be necessary for the five permanent members to agree as a whole to renounce their implicit veto right when it comes time for ratifying whatever changes the sovereign Assembly may adopt. That is the only way for us to overcome the impasse. It is necessary at the same time to define more rigorously the concept of international security not to abridge the authority of the Security Council but to strengthen that of other bodies. Political or strategic circumstances and considerations have given that concept political  economic  social  humanitarian  ecological and even legal ramifications. It is thus possible  invoking jurisprudence  to recommend measures against a State or a regime in unexpected spheres  arbitrarily chosen on the basis of defence considerations or the promotion of special national or regional interests. In that context  we want to state our appreciation for the Secretary-General's report ""An Agenda for Peace"". Despite the rigid framework within which that study was carried out  its vision is stimulating  its analyses relevant and its recommendations acceptable. We hope it will help shed new light on the concept of responsibility free from hegemony  so that this notion will attract more open  unambiguous support. I felt it necessary to stress the democratization of international relations because the strengthening of the Organization depends on it. Only an organization whose central role is set out in the documents  practice and acceptance of its members can guarantee the establishment and maintenance of relations among nations based on trust  equity and equal participation. We lay stress on the same principles when we address the problems of development  for we are convinced that their solution depends in large part on the status of international peace and security. So long as the international political situation is under a burden  the search for a solution to the development crisis will be in vain. The Organization indeed  the entire United Nations system is working along those lines  and we are glad that debate both at the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade  and Development (UNCTAD) and at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was marked by strengthened international cooperation for development. This theme reappeared at the high-level discussions in the Economic and Social Council. This awareness is reflected also in an acknowledgement that stress must be placed on the role of the United Nations as the only forum in which we can deal with these problems in an integrated manner. We must draw up universally accepted principles and rules; ensure coordination among the various development forums; harmonize the modalities for action by financial  monetary and trading institutions; and above all be aware of the political dimension of the decisions we shall have to make at all levels. That is the role of the Economic and Social Council; we must streamline and consolidate its functions in analysis and orientation to make it more effective system-wide. On the institutional level  we note a willingness to create controls and the beginnings of that process although unequal means do not always favour consensus among the bodies concerned. Then there is poverty. It is unbearable for its victims; it is unacceptable in a world that espouses solidarity. It has always been the lot of Africa  Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean  where economically fragile  poorly integrated  dislocated  marginalized societies barely survive  side by side with pockets of prosperity. I want to make special reference to my own continent of Africa  where poverty and its attendant disease  natural disasters and social conflicts have devastating  degrading effects. How can we ignore the fact that by the end of the century  although we expect 400 million fewer impoverished people in the world as a whole  there will be 100 million more in Africa? We are sometimes criticized for self-pity and for not making the efforts necessary to eliminate poverty in our countries. We are not immune to such criticism  but is it not true also that poverty will be eradicated only if the pace of economic growth is accelerated and if together we can solve the problems that are the underlying causes of underdevelopment? Give us the tools for action  quickly and under tolerable terms. In that context  I want to stress the urgency of reconsidering the question of our external debt; initiatives taken thus far have had no significant impact  despite the best intentions and despite a number of generous gestures made. We believe that initiatives must be reviewed and expanded to ensure the resumption of development and growth. To be complete  these initiatives must include additional resources  whether these come from official aid  the ""peace dividend"" or transfers in the form of investment. In that context  we hope an international conference on development financing will take place and will respond to our difficulties in implementing the various programmes and plans of action that have been adopted for the development of the countries of the South. Environmental protection and the promotion of sustainable development are the great challenges of the 1990s and beyond. We must therefore ensure the swift implementation of Agenda 21. Though an ambitious programme  it is commensurate with our respective responsibilities. Madagascar welcomes the convening in 1993 of the World Conference on Human Rights  in 1994 of the International Conference on Population and Development  and in 1995 of the World Summit for Social Development. The holding of those conferences reassures us in our determination to establish a society based upon social justice and true democracy  as reflected in the Constitution recently adopted by the people of Madagascar. We wish to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General and to the institutions and the friendly countries which have supported us in this process. New prospects for action are opening before us in the political  economic and social spheres. We have discussed them  reflected on them  and compared and contrasted our ideas regarding them. We have not always managed to avoid recrimination and confrontation  but over four decades which will soon be five we have constantly sought the best ways and means of promoting and perfecting cooperation between our peoples and between our States. With this cooperation we have everything to gain; without it we have everything to lose. This certainty could have been a valid guide for us in our common quest for more peace  more justice and more progress in a word  for bringing about a more humane world. We could have succeeded long ago had the course of events been more in our favour and had we agreed together to turn our visions into reality. General instability led us to doubt ourselves and also one another. However  the fact that we are gathered here bears witness to our readiness and determination to turn towards the United Nations in order to draw renewed certainty from it. This is not a risk-free undertaking  since it reveals our weaknesses and shortcomings. It is  however  worth making the effort in order to enable us to adjust our commitment to the challenges that continually assail us. Let us hope that it will lead to a renewal which is beneficial to the Organization and which in the final analysis will help us to keep the promises we have made to our peoples. "
"102",4481,"MDV",47,1992,"It	is	my	great honor and pleasure tocongratulate Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His election to this important office coincides with a critical juncture in the history of the United Nations when the world is taking a turn towards a new era in international relations  and I wish him success.I should also like to take this opportunity to extend my delegation's deep appreciation to his predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  who demonstrated outstanding skills of diplomacy and dedication during his term of office.It is also my pleasure to pay tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the leadership and vision he has brought to the Organization at a time of crucial change.Since we met last year  13 new Member States have taken their seats in our midst. I should like to extend a warm welcome to Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. I am confident that our Organization  which has always striven for universality  will greatly benefit from their participation in the work of the United Nations.He face a time of challenge and opportunity. The impasse that characterized international affairs for more than four decades through super-Power confrontation has ended  giving way to a new era of international cooperation. He dare to hope that the noble aspirations envisioned in the Charter of the United Nations may be within reach. Yet the way ahead is not without obstacles. New conflicts motivated by ultra-nationalism  ethnicism and even religious intolerance confront us daily.In these turbulent times the United Nations must play an active and constructive role in soothing the fears and anxieties of its Member States.In order to do so  the United Nations will need the full support and cooperation of all Members at the highest level  both large and small. The United Nations must be provided with the requisite support and resources needed to address the vital tasks that lie ahead. Never has the need for a strong and vibrant United Nations been greater  when we are on the threshold of a new century  a new awakening.He believe that the concepts put forward by the Secretary-General in his report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  deserve serious consideration. The need for both peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts with greater emphasis on the use of preventive diplomacy and post-conflict peace-building measures has never been more urgent. None of these indeed is a mutually exclusive concept  but they are closely interrelated and need to be implemented in a comprehensive manner. Too often  a conflict is allowed to rage on for too long  before the international community is convinced to act firmly  and too often this may be too late.Maldives is aware of the increasing financial pressure placed on the Organization as it is called upon to play an ever greater role in both conflict prevention and conflict resolution. It is imperative that the membership of the United Nations be committed to supporting these activities not by mere rhetoric but in substance. However  it may be fair to say that the smaller and the economically weaker members of this community will not be able to share on an equal level the burdens of the rapidly expanding peace-keeping and peacemaking activities of the Organization.Unchecked escalation of conflicts anywhere in the world affects all of us in varying degrees owing to the integrated nature of the global political economy. Yet we do not possess equal resources to address these problems. Perhaps it may be appropriate to consider directing a portion of the so-called peace dividend hoped for in the post-cold-war period towards United Nations peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts. That would ease the financial pressure being acutely felt by member nations  frequently unwitting victims of others' wars.During the past year we have witnessed a number of dramatic developments in the international arena  which inspire both hope and despair.The situation in the Middle East and the question of Palestine still remain to be solved. He are encouraged by the ongoing peace talks and commend all parties involved in the peace effort for their courage and fortitude in coming to the negotiating table. He feel that no permanent peace in the Middle East can ever be attained unless the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people are protected  the Arab lands occupied during the 1967 war are returned and the right of all States in the region to live in peace is guaranteed. In this respect we firmly believe that the guiding principles in any negotiated settlement should be United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).My delegation supports the efforts of the Secretary-General to facilitate the establishment of a national government in Cambodia by the middle of nest year. The participation of all concerned is vital  and we encourage all parties fully to cooperate with the Secretary-General in the implementation of the peace settlement.The progress that has been made in South Africa gives us reason for hope. However  we are disturbed by the repeated incidences of violence that have hindered the process of negotiations and disrupted efforts for dismantling apartheid and for the constitutional reforms that will ensure the rights of the black majority. We were heartened by the resumption of talks between the Government of South Africa and the African National Congress (ANC). We hope that the momentum will not be halted by a further outbreak of violence yet again.Despite the liberation of Kuwait at the end of the Gulf War  the international community and the people of Kuwait continue to be haunted by the tragic consequences of the invasion and the brutal occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. Maldives believes in the inviolability of international borders between countries and in this respect fully supports Security Council resolution 773 (1992)  which addresses the root causes of the conflict. We are deeply concerned about the fate of all Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners still being held in Iraq and hope for their early release and return to their homes and families. We consider this to be an issue of an urgent humanitariannature.In my address to the Assembly last year  I cautioned that we should not allow our post-cold-war euphoria to blind us to the possibility of new threats which may endanger international peace and security  such as nascent belligerent nationalism  political hegemony  excessive protectionism and racism coming to the forefront once again.It is with regret that I note that many of the fears that I had then are coming all too true today. The emergence of age-old rivalries based purely on ethnic differences and religious intolerance in the Republics of the former Yugoslavia have shocked and horrified the international community. The atrocities being committed against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the name of ""ethnic cleansing"" defy description. The oppression of ethnic minorities  indiscriminate killings and illegal arrests of innocent civilians must cease immediately. The international community should commit itself fully to the task of restoring peace in that region so that its peoples may resume their lives in peace and harmony.The world has seen remarkable progress in the realm of disarmament in recent years. Most noteworthy in this respect has been the agreement reached between the United States and the Russian Federation to reduce their nuclear arsenals by nearly 70 per cent. While we welcome that agreement  we should not be satisfied until the danger of nuclear proliferation is totally eliminated and the existing stockpiles are drastically reduced.The international community may consider putting its foot down harder in regions where the possibility of nuclear proliferation and the use of nuclear arms exists. Such pressure should be extended sooner rather than later  as proven in the experiences of the recent Gulf crisis. But that approach should be considered an integral part of the process of global disarmament.We have always supported the concept of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace. However  such zones cannot be realized without the desire and commitment of the States of the respective regions. We feel that the convening of international conferences or broad-based meetings on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and zones of peace should be preceded by consultations and a degree of agreement amongst the States concerned.Maldives considers that proposals for zones of peace and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones should be re-addressed or revived in the context of the current and newly emerging international situation.With regard to the proposals relevant to our own region  Maldives continues to support the establishment of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia. However  it may now be time to reinvigorate the process through the application of new and fresh ideas. We believe that the current international climate may make nations receptive to many of the ideas that were formerly not acceptable when the world was held captive to bloc politics.Maldives has always supported the prohibition and elimination of all forms of weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear  chemical and biological ones. We are happy to note that during the current session  a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons is to be adopted. We fully support this convention and intend to become one of its first signatories.While we are heartened at the progress being made in the field of disarmament  we have yet to see a very tangible return in the form of a peace dividend. The continuing economic deprivation in the developing countries poses a greater threat in many ways to the security of mankind than did the cold war. It is imperative that the developed countries direct their attention and resources to the assistance of the developing countries in their efforts to become more self-reliant.The continuing and widening disparity between the developed and developing countries remains a matter of concern. It is futile to believe that the world may enjoy peace and progress while two thirds of humanity lives in utter deprivation. We call on the developed countries to liberalize their trade practices and expeditiously to conclude the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The inequities inherent in the international economic system must be remedied and the developing countries given a fair and just opportunity to improve the socio-economic well-being of their peoples.This is the first opportunity the entire international community has had to comment jointly on the legacy of Rio. It is to be hoped that we all emerged from Rio imbued with a sense of commitment and the determination to implement the policies emanating from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. More than any other  my country is aware of the severe consequences inherent in ignoring the continuing degradation of the environment.Maldives is proud to have been one of the initial signatories of both the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions and we shall very shortly ratify them. We urge all others to do the same in order that the provisions of the Conventions may be implemented.One of the very important documents of the Rio Summit was Agenda 21.This session of the General Assembly has been charged with the task of organizing and implementing certain decisions included in that Agenda. One of those is the establishment of a commission on sustainable development  which Maldives fully supports.As a small island State with minimal resources that are inadequate to confront the monumental environmental challenges we face  Maldives eagerly anticipates the convening of the Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States in 1993. We hope that all countries will participate in that conference to the fullest extent possible.I should also like to recall at this juncture that during this session we are marking the second anniversary of another summit of equal importance the World Summit for Children. The Declaration endorsed by that Summit has now been signed by some 140 Heads of State or Government  and over 130 countries have prepared or are in the process of developing national programs of action to achieve the goals set out in the Declaration. It is now time for the implementation of these programs. Maldives has been working closely with the members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to execute the national programs of action adopted in the region.We have just completed a ministerial conference on children  held in Colombo  where the Colombo Resolution on Children was adopted. It is our hope that the objectives set forth at the Summit for Children will also continue to be given the highest priority by all countries and that its noble aims will never be neglected.Experience has proven that peace can never be achieved through force or a balance of military strength. We have laid to waste so much of our precious and irreplaceable resources. It is time we forged a new path for peace based on partnership and cooperation. That is what the United Nations has always striven for. We  for our part  renew our pledge of full support and commitment to the noble objectives and principles enshrined in the Charter.As I stated at the beginning  this is a time of challenge and opportunity. Let us not walk away from these challenges. Let us face them with resolve and dedication. Our goals can be achieved only through political will. The world deserves no less. "
"103",4528,"MEX",47,1992,"The Government of Mexico congratulates Mr. Stoyan Ganev on his election as President to guide the work of the General Assembly. It also congratulates Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his decision to engage in active diplomacy  to initiate the changes called for in the Secretariat and to devise new ways of strengthening the Organization. Mexico extends a most cordial welcome to the 13 new Member States. The new conditions in the world  the long-standing aspirations of peoples and the pressures of all kinds facing this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly require us to chart a clear course. The disappearance of the blocs has not led to the emergence of the peaceful world of which we dreamed. Uncertainty prevails. In many societies  one political order has disappeared and the order which has taken its place is in the midst of a difficult process of shaping itself. World trends are extremely contradictory. Some countries' efforts to integrate are in contrast to the disintegration of other countries. It would appear that the potential for conflict  now free of ideological bonds  has increased in various regions of the world. Despite the fact that bipolarity has vanished  international peace and security continue to be threatened by aggressive nationalisms  political and religious fanaticism and  above all  the conditions of critical poverty and inequality of opportunities that separate some peoples from others. As this session of the General Assembly takes place  thousands of people are continuing to die in the fratricidal wars in former Yugoslavia and other parts of the world. In Africa  the life of whole populations is threatened by hunger. The life of more than half of the world's population is dominated by unemployment and the impossibility of attaining decent levels of health  education  food and housing. Decisive progress in economic  social and human development and root-and-branch rectification of the structural imbalances in international society are necessary conditions for genuine and lasting peace. One fifth of the world's population  1 billion people inhabiting the most industrialized countries  consume 70 per cent of the planet's resources. In income terms.  the polarization of inequalities is even greater. The richest fifth of the world's population accounts for 83 per cent of total income  while the poorest fifth has to make do with 1.4 per cent. Future prospects are no less tragic: the World Bank estimates that the income of the population with the fewest resources will fall from $370 a year to only $225 by the year 2000. Now that the cold war is over  there is no argument strong enough to justify the persistence of these imbalances. Plenty and overabundance for a few cannot coexist with poverty and deprivation for the majorities. We can already see the global impact of these inequalities: The increase in migrations to the more prosperous countries is unprecedented. Millions of people throughout the world are forming legions of refugees and displaced persons. It would be a dangerous illusion for the rich societies to believe that their security is not in jeopardy from the intensification of these imbalances. It must be recognized that it will not be possible to cure underdevelopment and the resulting poverty and marginalization in many countries by the use of market forces alone. What is needed is a major internal correction effort involving both the State and private individuals  or involving mainly the State  when private individuals are unwilling  do not know how or do not have the resources to act. A favourable international environment is also required to more effectively encourage a comprehensive solution to the serious problems of underdevelopment. The Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is promoting the expansion of markets and the need for flows of goods and services to grow without artificial barriers of a political or economic nature. We therefore already have a free trade agreement with Chile  and we have just negotiated a treaty to establish the North American free trade area  which will be the most potent trading zone in the world. With an open trading system  without discrimination and protectionist barriers  the developing countries could earn around $44 billion more from exports. That would undoubtedly increase the viability of the structural reforms these nations have undertaken  and would reflect international solidarity with these countries. Mexico has been active in promoting reform of the United Nations. It has joined the consensus that there is a vital need to redistribute functions and responsibilities among its organs  increase coordination and democratize its procedures. Our Organization is overworked and underfinanced. Its renewal must include the fulfilment by all Members of their financial commitments. That there is an endemic financial crisis at the United Nations  in the face of the extensive tasks the community is seeking to assign to it  is an incongruency which must be resolved without delay. Mexico recognizes the relevance of the Secretary-General's report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  submitted for the consideration of Member States. It is a rigorous document  and proposes the innovative measures that are needed in order to enable our Organization to respond to the challenges of a new era. The ideas that it puts before us for achieving a better balance between the principal organs of the United Nations appear to us to be on the right lines. We need to give the General Assembly the primacy it should enjoy as the Organization's universal and pluralistic organ par excellence. We have to achieve better coordination between it and the Security Council  above all in matters of international peace and security. We agree with the strengthening of the Secretary-General's capacity for action. We consider that the Secretary-General should be authorized to seek advisory opinions from the International Court of Justice on condition  of course  that the States concerned have requested his involvement. Mexico has also indicated the need for a better balance in the treatment of the items on the international agenda. We pay too much attention to the so-called new global issues at the expense of development problems  combating extreme poverty and strengthening international cooperation. The best preventive diplomacy is one in which programmes in support of development are an essential element. These are the best guarantees of stable and lasting peace. The economic and social sector of the Organization needs to be revitalized. Now is the time to increase the efficiency of the organs on which rests the main responsibility for economic and social activities: the Economic and Social Council and the Second and Third Committees of the Assembly. My country has reiterated that the internal transformation of the United Nations organs  as well as of relationships between them  needs to be supplemented by the democratization of decision-making. This will entail reviewing  in due course  the anachronistic veto system. We must dispel the risk of the Security Council's becoming merely an instrument for lending the appearance of joint action to the designs of a few powerful countries. The deliberative and decision-making processes must be transparent. The tendency for the taking of decisions by consensus to become more widespread must not pose an obstacle to participation by Council members  nor must it impede in-depth debate among them.  Some of the measures proposed in the Secretary-General's report need to be studied thoroughly and carefully  as they might prove to be counterproductive. Deployment of troops along the borders of a State that feels threatened might aggravate the problem it was designed to forestall. The proposal for the conduct of preventive deployment operations in conditions of national crisis gives grounds for concern. A measure of this kind could involve the Organization in issues that are strictly within the internal jurisdiction of States. Similarly  what is known as ""support for the transformation of deficient national structures and capabilities  and for the strengthening of new democratic institutions"" (A/47/277  para. 59). should be examined with great care  since these matters fall within the exclusive sovereignty of States. The report also echoes positions that Mexico has supported. We agree that States should accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. Honduras and El Salvador have set the world an example of their desire for harmony and peace by submitting their territorial dispute to the International Court for resolution. Mexico welcomes the insistence of the Secretary-General that diplomatic action should be exhausted before use is made of the coercive measures for the maintenance of international peace and security referred to in Chapter VII of the Charter. Despite the disquieting signs in the international environment  obvious advances have been made which enable us to look with hope to the potential of the United Nations to work towards a more stable and a more secure world. Long-drawn-out conflicts that had been deadlocked for years are today on the way to resolution. The peace process in El Salvador is perhaps the most successful of those in which the Organization has participated. It is up to the parties and the Organization itself to do everything in their power to ensure the implementation  within the time-frame scheduled  of the commitments entered into. Mexico appeals to the international community to provide  as soon as possible  the economic assistance promised for the cause of peace in El Salvador. In the realm of disarmament  definite progress has been achieved in the quantitative reduction of nuclear arsenals but we are far from having eliminated the danger of a nuclear catastrophe. There has been an increase in the number of States that possess nuclear weapons  and the doctrine of nuclear deterrence continues to serve as grounds for justifying the existence and improvement of such weapons. In the face of these dangers  we must put an end to nuclear testing. We therefore express our gratitude to those countries that have decided to institute moratoriums. Mexico will continue to work to see to it that at this session we are able to make progress together towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons from the planet. Therefore  the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons deserves our full attention. We are gratified at the progress in respect of the Treaty of Tlatelolco. We welcome the ratification by France of Additional Protocol I and the process leading to the full incorporation of Argentina  Brazil and Chile in the nuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America. We hope that Cuba will also soon be incorporated into this regime  as well as Guyana and St. Kitts and Nevis. Mention also needs to be made of the Convention on chemical weapons  the outcome of 10 years' work by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Conference on Disarmament. Although the Convention is undoubtedly subject to improvement  Mexico hopes that it will lead to the elimination of one of the most reprehensible means of mass destruction. The Rio de Janeiro Conference  held last June  was a basic step towards greater awareness at the world level of the relationship between the problems of the environment and those of development. The General Assembly has the responsibility of creating institutional machinery to follow up  promote and perfect the implementation of ""Agenda 21""  approved at Rio. The establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development is a central item on our agenda. In this regard  I should like to make three points: the first is that this Commission should not confine itself to reviewing the progress made in Rio  but should become a high-level forum for updating and introducing new proposals designed to promote development and the protection of the environment. The second point relates to its mandate of supervising and broadening the commitment with regard to financing. We shall achieve little in the struggle for sustainable development of the planet if the countries that possess the most and have contributed the most to pollution do not increase the resources allocated to halting the destruction of the environment. The Commission to be appointed by this General Assembly must ensure that it is the polluter who pays. Finally  following up on the Rio agreements calls for a competent secretariat. We are expecting a small but high-level group with direct access to the Secretary-General and a clear mandate to avoid duplication of functions with other bodies. We are living through a phase characterized by profound respect for human rights and democracy as the foundations of peace  freedom and human dignity. The defence of human rights has always been at the centre of our Organization's attention. Nevertheless  we are concerned at the desire to focus greater attention on some aspects of human rights to the detriment of others. Only a comprehensive view of human rights can ensure that their protection will not be partial or motivated by veiled aspirations towards interference. The Organization has the opportunity of becoming the cornerstone of a new world order worthy of that name. It is our responsibility towards future generations to bequeath to them a forum in which peace is guaranteed and in which the conditions required for the development of all nations are created. International cooperation for development cannot be approached from one standpoint alone. We must not view it solely as a complement to actions to resolve conflicts or to reduce it to technical assistance programmes  nor can it be confined to general recommendations regarding the liberalization of trade and internal and international competitiveness. The priorities are clear: putting an end to extreme poverty and creating the conditions in which all human beings will find real opportunities for development. To this end  a tremendous and serious effort to coordinate economic policies and the explicit will to make international law the compulsory reference point governing relations among peoples are essential. International- law is the binding force that will make it possible to build a true international order at the end of this century. Our Organization must assume with clear vision  dedication and courage world leadership in the  defence of international law. Respect for the internal jurisdiction of States is the basis for our civilized and peaceful coexistence. Mexico categorically rejects the claim of any State to have the right to apply its laws beyond its own frontiers. Nor can acts that violate the juridical order of another country on the pretext of ensuring respect for one's law be legal. All States must conform in their actions to the rules that have been accepted by the sovereign will of nations and agreements. This is the only lasting foundation on which to base changes in a world order that is in a state of transition. Here in this universal forum  Mexico emphasizes its unswerving commitment to the need to strengthen international law. "
"104",4554,"MHL",47,1992," I take this opportunity warmly to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We know that we are in capable hand as we face the important tasks ahead of us. I should also like to express my appreciation to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  for the distinguished manner in which he guided the General Assembly during the last session. It was one year ago that the General Assembly honoured the Republic of the Marshall Islands by granting it membership in the United Nations. On this anniversary  as we reflect on our times  we note that a central feature of the international political landscape of the past several years has been the emergence or the re-emergence of the nationalities. It is our grave responsibility to serve our nations during this challenging period of transition and development. Throughout the world we are seeing the advent of self-government by nations. The sovereignty and dignity of indigenous peoples are coming to be recognized as the basis for effective government. In the Marshall Islands  as in other developing countries throughout the world  we have set high aspirations for our nation and we seek expanded opportunities for our people. Our children will no longer be denied achievement of their potential because of the time and place into which they were born. They will be the hope and the pride of our nation  and our future. We are grateful to the United Nations for its steadfast commitment to fostering the self-government and self-determination of peoples. For many peoples  it has been a long time coming. Like so many countries  large and small  the Marshall Islands was for four and a half decades relegated to one camp of the great cold-war struggle. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War  the residents of Bikini and Enewetak Atolls in the Northern Marshall Islands were relocated from their ancestral homes so that the United States Government could conduct an extensive and widely publicized programme of testing atomic and nuclear weapons. Even though the testing programme was discontinued in the late 1950s  our Government and people are still coming to terms with its effects on our health and way of life. We have many good reasons to applaud the end of the cold war.  The breakdown of the two contending camps has left a world in which we can no longer conveniently apply the simple classification of nations into the Eastern bloc or the Western block. It is a time fraught with uncertainty and risk  but it is also a time for rethinking our concepts of government and its relation to individual citizens. And with this rethinking we must see that greater responsibilities are opened to mankind. We are finding that the expediencies that once worked in the cold war centres of power are too broad  too large in scale  too impersonal  for the smaller nations. Development is now taking place on a more human scale. The growth of nations is providing the context for human ingenuity to assert itself with fewer restraints. The progress of the past decade has resulted in a greater portion of mankind than ever before living in situations of political and economic freedom. Increasingly  the human spirit has been able to soar unfettered by restraints and regulations imposed by authorities too distant from individuals' circumstances. In a setting of liberty  the individual is empowered to advance to the extent of his ability. For many years teachers in the Marshall Islands have sought to implement the wise insight of Marcus Aurelius: ""Give a man a fish and you have fed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you have fed him for ever."" Some of our teachers have even convinced themselves that this is Marshallese folk wisdom! But at least they recognize that the most effective help is self-help. The exchange of ideas and the reduction of trade barriers have served to draw mankind together. People throughout the world are now cooperating in the developmental process. In no nation do people live in the isolation that our  ancestors did only a century ago and that some people endured until the end of the cold war. But  in the face of modernization  the people and places of the world have retained their particular attributes  and these are now giving force and cohesion to their national characters. The past year has seen the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. At this historic gathering the nations of the world agreed to pursue their developmental goals in a manner that will sustain the ecological diversity of our planet. We in the Marshall Islands  living on low-lying coral atolls and islands  have been following with great interest the scientific debate over global warming. The same careful approach that we have applied to evaluating the impact of nuclear testing in our islands is also being applied to the possible dangers of a rise in sea level. In this regard  I am pleased to reiterate the call that President Amata Kabua of the Marshall Islands made at the Rio Summit for the United Nations to convene a follow-up Earth Summit in 1995  coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. If global warming endangers certain regions and certain modes of life  we have to confirm the risks and inform our citizens about them. An environment at risk will be a significant constraint for the developing nations in the late twentieth century. Nevertheless  our concern for environmental quality need not put a halt to the developmental process. Instead  it will be part of the overall situation to which individuals will respond with creativity and productivity. With the assistance of the United Nations  the people of our countries will continue to benefit from the international structure of trade  cultural exchanges  environmental studies and the resolution of disputes. The heart of the United Nations consists of the many Member nation-States. The rich mix of nationalities is certainly complicating the map of the world. Our challenge is to find collective benefit in this diversity. As a primary obligation  of course  we must meet basic human needs that are beyond local capabilities: collectively  we can help feed the starving refugees of Somalia; we can commit our manpower and financial resources to help bring peace to the Middle East and in the Balkan States; we can provide emergency assistance to the victims of natural disasters; we can continue to work towards the eradication of the great plagues. In these situations  where the human need is greatest  the United Nations is admirably serving its purposes. In addition  the techniques and processes made available by the agencies of the United Nations have helped provide our citizens with security and basic public services. On the other hand  the preservation of cultural diversity  and probably the preservation of environmental diversity  will require the direct commitment of nations and individuals. In an era of national consciousness  most matters of public policy  even those with international consequences  are going to be worked out at the national level - and frequently locally and individually. Let us celebrate the diverse nationalities  and do everything in our power to nurture our peoples and enable them to lead lives that are full and contented and peaceful."

My delegation welcomes the new Member States  whose presence here confirms the universality of our Organization and the inestimable value of the ideals and principles contained in the Charter. My country  Mali  has undergone profound political changes over the last two years. On 26 March 1991  at the cost of enormous sacrifice but with clarity of purpose  our people brought a monolithic dictatorial regime to an end. The united actions of democratic forces made it possible to organize a transition  to ensure the normal functioning of elections  and to establish the institutions of the Third Republic. Thus the National Conference held in Bamako from 29 July to 12 August 1991 drew up the fundamental instruments for the Third Republic of Mali. The democratic process has continued in accordance with a precise electoral timetable  drawn up with the contributions and assistance of all the country's political forces. The campaigning of some 40 political parties confirmed the irreversible commitment of the country towards a political opening which is unprecedented in the history of modern Mali. The election of the President of the Third Republic  His Excellency Mr. Alpha Oumar Konare  and his official appointment on 8 June 1992 are the culmination of long years of struggle and sacrifice of an entire people. A new Coalition Government is in place and a National Assembly made up of 11 political parties is working to strengthen the administration  the rule of law and respect for human rights in the Republic of Mali. To conclude this chapter  I should like to express the profound gratitude of the people and the Government of Mali to friendly countries and to international organizations and agencies  in particular the United Nations system  for their valuable advice and their excellent contributions to the various electoral consultations which led to the establishment of a pluralist democracy. The young Malian democracy was nevertheless born with a serious handicap  that of the burdensome heritage of a past of several decades of dictatorship  bad management  a single-party system and quasi-indifference to the suffering of the population. This intolerable political situation  aggravated by the impact of the drought and by continuing deterioration of living conditions in arid zones  finally led to a rebellion among the nomadic population in the north in 1990. To resolve this painful problem the Government decided on a negotiated solution. Algerian mediation  along with assistance from friendly countries and from certain eminent foreign personalities  made it possible for us to create an atmosphere of mutual trust. Thus on 11 April 1992 in Bamako a National Pact was signed  between the Government and all of these rebel movements  before the nation and the whole of Africa and in the presence of representatives from all continents. This agreement was accepted by all parties as an instrument of peace  solidarity and national unity. The agreement is first an act of national will  a plan of action to combat drought and desertification  and as such falls within the scope of Agenda 21. It is also a plan for agropastoral development requiring the use of technologies adapted to arid and semi-arid zones and calling for the re-establishment of populations in a damaged and vulnerable environment. It is an integrated programme for human development designed to unleash the initiative and production potential of men and women living in these areas. Finally  it includes a strict respect for sovereignty and the territorial integrity of our country  but also a recognition of the right to diversity. The fresh hope it has stirred and its implementation require the mobilization of major resources that greatly exceed our own capacities. That is why my Government appeals to the international community  to governmental and non-governmental organizations involved in cooperation  and to the good will of all to help us to implement the various programmes under the agreement. The National Pact remains for my country the ideal means for ensuring peace and security  indispensable conditions for our development. This development is imperative  and everything will be done by the Mali Government to ensure the full implementation of all aspects of the agreement. We should like the same to hold for all signatories old and new alike. The Mali of today which respects human rights stresses dialogue and rejects  violence as a means of expression. Our young democracy allows all its sons and daughters to express themselves freely and to defend their interests within the framework of political parties or associations. This context must  firstly  permit the reconciliation of hearts and spirits; secondly  it must consolidate the peace which has been restored and thus ensure resumption of the development activities in the northern regions of our country which  for lack of security  had been abandoned over the last two years by most of our development partners. But neither the problem of the north nor the economic difficulties of the country have hampered the will or the determination of our people to take charge of and succeed in their development. These are signs of hope and pledges of success that the new conditions of democracy will reinforce. The deterioration in the political situation in certain parts of the world is of concern to our delegation. At a time when the international community thought it had seen the last of the great human tragedies which have long darkened many regions of the world  now societies of old civilizations have been drawn into the whirlwind of fratricidal conflicts. Mali is concerned by the situation existing in the Horn of Africa  in particular in Somalia. In addition to drought  the escalation of violence in tenacious rivalries of factions confronting one another desperately and  apparently  without any real justification  has subjected the Somali population to terrible suffering. Food shortages  endemic famine and malnutrition  and refugees flowing into neighbouring countries are all situations requiring more intensive humanitarian intervention by the United Nations to support the praiseworthy efforts of the Organization of African Unity and of many others of good will.  In South Africa  the delicate process of change towards the establishment of a State based on law and on fundamental principles of democracy and of respect for human rights remains fragile in many respects. The negotiations in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) offer an opening we heartily welcome. But the violence that has been provoked and encouraged by the enemies of change threatens to delay the advent of a free  democratic and multiracial South Africa. A lessening in diplomatic isolation and the progressive lifting of economic and sports sanctions are gestures of goodwill by the international community. It is thus time for the South African Government to explore the opportunities offered to it to assume its responsibilities all of its responsibilities in order to halt the cycle of violence and to create conditions conducive to genuine negotiations.* In addition  the serious crisis afflicting Liberia for several years continues despite the efforts of the Heads of State of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Mali hopes that the relevant decisions taken at the ECOWAS Summit in Dakar will be honoured by all the parties to this fratricidal conflict so that the West African subregion can regain its balance and stability. My delegation is pleased that in Angola the process of national reconciliation has made it possible to establish a true democratic process  thus finally bringing a long-lasting tragedy to an end. As regards Mozambique  we hope that consultation and dialogue will prevail over the use of arms. The sensitive question of Western Sahara remains pending as we await the implementation of all the provisions of the United Nations peace plan. Mali urges all the parties concerned to let consensual approaches prevail in dealing with that thorny problem so as to enable the United Nations to accomplish its mission. The breakup of Yugoslavia has taken the form of a cruel ethnic war  which has led the United Nations to increase its initiatives in order to put an end to the tragedy of millions of elderly people  women and children. One of the oldest conflicts  that of the Middle East  which our Organization has dealt with for several decades  has seen encouraging developments with the opening and continuation of Israeli-Arab negotiations. The international community must encourage the process that is under way  so that contacts will lead to a just and lasting peace. For our part  Mali reaffirms its support for any initiative leading to a comprehensive and lasting solution to that conflict  which must necessarily include  first  Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied territories; secondly  the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and independence; and thirdly  the right of all States in the region to exist within secure and recognized borders. We are pleased to note that the United Nations peace plan in Cambodia is now operational. This is proof that perseverance  mutual trust and dialogue are effective weapons in preventive diplomacy. Turning to the Korean peninsula  Mali  which maintains good relations with both Koreas  encourages the process of direct negotiations embarked upon by both parties with a view to the peaceful reunification of the Korean homeland. Indeed  all round the world  Mali hopes for the restoration of peace through dialogue and agreement. Once rid of the spectre of violence and war  the United Nations will be able to devote its human  technical and financial potential to the noble objectives of economic and social development  so much needed by the world. While  politically  the beginning of the 1990s has ushered in an era of democracy for many developing countries  and most particularly for those in Africa  the economic situation of our countries remains extremely critical. Indeed  unlike the industrialized countries  where we have seen a recovery in economic activity under the triple impact of a decrease in interest rates  the return of oil prices to a level close to that existing before the crisis and the effective coordination of economic policies  in developing countries the situation has been marked  overall  by continuing serious economic and financial difficulties  deterioration of the terms of trade  a scarcity of financial resources for private investment  debt burden and grave doubts regarding the conclusions of multilateral trade negotiations and the threat of protectionism. In order to prevent the profound imbalances augured by that situation  our countries agreed to carry out structural adjustment reforms in order to open themselves up more to the world economy. However  we remain convinced that in order to emerge from the crisis and at the same time save our democratic experience  international solidarity must be made manifest. It must develop rapidly and be equal to the problems to be solved.  The international community must strive to free up  for the poorest countries  sufficient resources to correct the imbalances in our economies  to mitigate the effects of adjustment on the most vulnerable sectors and to permit the financing of priority programmes for basic development. Hopes for reforms in international economic relations to reduce inequalities between the developed and the developing countries are  unfortunately  still being frustrated by a lack of progress in the establishment of an appropriate North-South dialogue. South-South cooperation and subregional economic cooperation  enabling developing countries to overcome certain difficulties through a rational use of their complementarities can also help to reopen the irreplaceable North-South dialogue. Some progress has been achieved in subregional economic integration  but our Organization must support that process by formulating policies that will create common economic configurations at the subregional level. It is for all these reasons that the Government of Mali strongly supports the spirit of structural reform and supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in this context. As a Sahelian country  Mali was pleased with the holding of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and is pleased with its pertinent recommendations. This is an opportunity for us to recall that in the face of the serious threats hanging over our planet  the international community as a whole must set up  for its own survival  collective management of the environment that is more responsible than it has been in the past  that is fairer and truly universal. To that end it must undertake vigorous action to put an end to the use of the countries in the South as dumps for toxic and nuclear waste from industrialized countries. By the same token  we must help countries to combat desertification  pollution and all other processes that are likely to threaten the human habitat. Our Organization has contributed to the consolidation of security and cooperation among nations. It has never been so active and effective in the service of peace. However  our most ardent desire is to see it evolve towards greater democracy so as to respond to the major changes that have occurred recently on the international scene. That democratization comes  necessarily  through taking into account all the interests of all the components of the United Nations in future reforms. Humanity finds itself at a stage in its history that requires the international community to display pragmatism  creativity and solidarity; in brief  it must develop a fruitful system of partnership. Never in this respect has mankind possessed so many human and technological assets. Thus  we must build together a new international order based on equity and justice."
"106",4664,"MLT",47,1992,"It is with a special sense of satisfaction that I wish to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. His country  Bulgaria  is a protagonist in an exhilarating democratization and liberalization process that is transforming a whole region and has already ushered in a new era in international relations. It is therefore most appropriate that  as a representative of his country and his region  he should be presiding over the General Assembly in these momentous and challenging times. The exceptional nature of our times is reflected in the fact that over the last eight months 13 countries have become Members of the United Nations. We welcome these new Members  many of which are a direct product of the dramatic developments of the last few years. Their membership constitutes a further welcome affirmation of the universality of our Organisation. In January this year a new Secretary-General took over the charge of the United Nations. His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali is a most respected and long-time friend of Malta. He has brought an impressive dose of energy and intellectual force to the task of restructuring the United Nations on the solid foundations left by his predecessor. The international community is indeed most fortunate in having individuals of such high calibre and dedication consistently in its service. Bold and far-sighted leadership is of critical importance at the present juncture of international relations. Ours is a time when major challenges and exceptional opportunities compete with each other for attention and action; a time when hope  rather than fear  colours humanity's vision of its future - a vision which places the individual at the centre of all activity and which sees as an ultimate and cherished objective the creation of a just and prosperous community of nations living in peace and harmony with each other. Events over the past 12 months have brought home the reality that the demise of the cold war did not automatically usher in the era of uninterrupted peace  stability and prosperity to which we are all aspiring. Vast problems still remain in the political  social and economic spheres  and at the national  regional and international levels. What is new today is the possibility for the whole international community to consider these problems as a shared burden standing in the path of a common vision. We therefore strive for their resolution on the basis of practical cooperation rather than seek to exploit them divisively in the framework of ideological confrontation. At first glance  the emerging world order presents a dark tapestry of rekindled ethnic and national rivalries  massive economic disparities  extensive and irreversible environmental degradation  and horrific instances of human suffering. In the context of what is happening in the former Yugoslavia  in Somalia  and elsewhere  it may indeed sound ironic to identify the spirit of cooperation as the touchstone of this new world order. Yet these unprecedented problems of our times have also generated an unprecedented determination for cooperative action at both the regional and the global levels. In cases like Yugoslavia and Somalia  the efforts so far undertaken have fallen far short of the needs. Yet the international community persists in its collective endeavour to achieve a peaceful solution of these problems. In this it finds encouragement in the progress being achieved elsewhere  especially in Cambodia  in Central America and in Angola. A few days ago Malta joined a large majority of the United Nations membership in deciding to deny the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro its claim to succeed the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  and consequently in calling upon it to reapply for United Nations membership in conformity with the provisions of the Charter. We did so in the light of our shared abhorrence of the atrocities that are taking place in the region of former Yugoslavia. In the Middle East  the peace process launched in Madrid last year continues upon its fragile but persistent path. In South Africa  the hopes for an early and peaceful dismantlement of the policy of apartheid have ebbed and flowed in recent months in the wake of alternately encouraging and tragic events. In these instances too  however  the collective determination of the international community to promote a peaceful and lasting resolution of long-standing problems  on the basis of principles contained in relevant United Nations resolutions  is pre-eminent. Equally steadfast is the collective determination to bring peace and justice to other still-troubled peoples around the globe  in particular the peoples of Cyprus  of Afghanistan and of Mozambique. In the year of the Rio Conference we are perhaps particularly conscious of the fact that the equitable and sustainable economic and social development of all peoples is not only a major objective in its own right; it is an indivisible component of international peace and security. The sharp economic and social disparities which continue to intensify  both within and among nations  pose a direct challenge to the hopes for peace and security raised by the emerging new order in international relations. There is growing recognition of the fact that an approach to these problems must be rooted in the notion of global economic interdependence a notion that must inspire concrete action at the global  as well as at the regional  level on such questions as international trade  financial flows  transfer of technology and debt relief. Major projects of regional cooperation  such as those that are taking place in North America  Western Europe and South-East Asia should therefore be conceived of as stepping-stones towards increased trade and economic cooperation at the global level  rather than as attempts to create a set of monolithic and competing trading blocs in different parts of the world. A successful and balanced outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations would go a long way towards providing the necessary defences against any insidious and harmful fragmentation of world trade. The disappearance of super-Power confrontation has perhaps had its most direct and visible impact in the field of disarmament. At the bilateral level  there have already been significant reductions in the nuclear and conventional arsenals of the two major Powers. The prospects for an indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and for a comprehensive test-ban treaty are encouraging. At its current session the General Assembly will be considering a draft convention for a comprehensive ban on chemical armaments  including their means of delivery  which has been finalized by the Conference on Disarmament. Malta welcomes these developments and expresses the hope that they are the precursors to further cuts in strategic arsenals  especially as regards weapons of mass destruction  thereby releasing resources to be used for much-needed development purposes. At the same time  however  we should not lose sight of other  less rosy  aspects of the disarmament question  that now  more than before  assume greater relevance in the context of efforts towards reducing tensions and enhancing international security. This is the case in particular with regard to regional disarmament. The proliferation of armaments  conventional or otherwise  at the regional level is a matter of serious concern. It is a factor that directly and negatively affects security and stability at both regional and broader levels. At the same time  it absorbs scarce resources that could otherwise be utilized for economic and social development. The European experience  through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  has been that the progressive reduction of mutual suspicion through the adoption of confidence- and security-building measures plays a significant role in creating the necessary conditions for disarmament at the regional level. Transparency is an important aspect of confidence-building. In this context  the setting up by the General Assembly last year of the Register of Conventional Arms was an important first step  which Malta had indeed advocated as far back as the late 1960s. It is hoped that this initiative will be followed up  within the various regions  by determined efforts towards other concrete measures of confidence building. The United Nations system is today being called upon to play a determining role in a vast and bewildering array of problems. Our Organization was originally conceived in the perspective of global cooperation  not of super-Power confrontation. After a 45-year gap  it is only now  with the dawning of an era of cooperation  that it can therefore begin to operate fully in pursuit of its essential vocation for peace and  understanding among nations. It is essential that we all play our part in ensuring that it has the necessary resources  and appropriate structures  to fulfil its tasks. The original United Nations structures combine the principle of equality with the pragmatic differentiation of roles and responsibilities arising from different capabilities and historical circumstances. In the field of peace and international security  the two complementary poles of the United Nations system are the General Assembly and the Security Council. A dynamic relationship between these two organs remains the prerequisite for the credible and effective functioning of the United Nations in the field of peace and international security. Many of the issues related to these matters have been impressively examined in two reports prepared by the Secretary-General during the course of this year. The first is the report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"". The second is his first annual report to the General Assembly. These reports contain a wealth of new ideas and proposals dealing with the evolving role of the United Nations in preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping  and the promotion of economic and social development. These ideas provide us with an excellent stimulus to rethink the role that the United Nations can and needs to play if the end of the cold war is to become the beginning of a constructive peace. In his reports  the Secretary-General also pays special attention to regional cooperation  which is increasingly being seen as a useful  indeed a necessary  complement to multilateral action at the global level. Perhaps what is most needed in this regard is that regional and global actions be better harmonized and made to dovetail into each other. This is one reason why Malta proposed to the CSCE and the proposal was endorsed at the Helsinki summit in July that the CSCE be designated as a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. Likewise  Malta has been urging for some years that the provisions for the establishment of technology development centres related to regional seas envisaged in the Convention on the Law of the Sea be put into effect in such obvious contexts as the Mediterranean  the Caribbean and the South Pacific. We have also urged that these functional centres should illustrate the new concepts of governance that have emerged as most appropriate to the new world order that is  their governing bodies should include not only representatives of States  but also non-governmental bodies  whether set up on a national or on a plurinational basis. Such centres would be geared both to encouraging the transfer of technology and also  and perhaps more important  to promoting co-development of new  locally adapted technology. As a European country  Malta seeks to participate as actively as possible in the many-faceted and far-reaching initiatives for regional cooperation that are unfolding on the European continent. Recent developments in our region have injected new life and vigour into longstanding institutions such as the Council of Europe and the Economic Commission for Europe  whose pioneering role in many areas of economic and social development at the regional level has always been recognized. From the darkest days of the cold war  the CSCE sought its vocation in the merging of the strict issues of disarmament with the wider aspects of cooperation in the economic  social and humanitarian fields. For nearly four decades the European Community has slowly and painstakingly forged a path towards regional economic and political  integration which  in spite of the present difficulties  represents the best guarantee for a secure and prosperous future for all the peoples of this historically troubled continent. Malta sees in its aspiration to become a full member of the European Community a natural culmination of its European identity and of the role it has played over the years in promoting European cooperation  within the Council of Europe  the Economic Commission for Europe and the CSCE. For us  membership of the European Community is an overriding political objective founded upon the conviction that such membership offers us the best prospects for political  economic and social development while permitting us to play our rightful role in a unique experiment for regional integration. Our geographical location in the centre of the Mediterranean has also made us conscious of the issues which were so effectively highlighted at this year's United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  notably the awareness of the fragility of our planet Earth and the intimate relationship that exists between human development and ecological stability. The General Assembly at this session has an important task in following up the decisions taken at Rio  with regard both to the implementation of the proposals and recommendations contained in Agenda 21 and also to the establishment of the new commission for sustainable development. In this context  Malta shares the view that  in the endeavour to restructure and adapt the United Nations system better to deal with the issues of the new world order  a revitalized role could be found for the Trusteeship Council as a guardian of the common heritage of future generations  to replace its fast disappearing role as trustee of dependent Territories. Over the 28 years of its United Nations membership  Malta has taken particular pride in identifying its commitment to multilateralism  especially through its many initiatives on issues related to the environment as it constitutes a common concern of mankind. It is worth noting that this year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of Malta's proposal to the General Assembly that the seabed and ocean floor be reserved exclusively in the interests of mankind. Also this year we have been gratified to see our latest initiative  related to the protection of climate for present and future generations  resulting in the signing of the Framework Convention on Climate Change by over 150 nations. We earnestly hope that the ratification of the Convention will proceed quickly to ensure its early coming into force. The basic starting-point and the goal of our activities is the well-being of the individual in society. The importance of the human dimension in all our endeavours should not and cannot be underestimated. It is in this context that Malta attaches fundamental importance to issues of human rights. Over the years  the United Nations has elaborated major instruments relating to human rights  starting with the Universal Declaration and leading up to the Covenants on civil and political  economic  social and cultural rights  and the Convention against torture  to all of which Malta is a party. Collective action aimed at ensuring the effective protection of the rights enshrined in these documents should not  in our view  be unduly constrained by arguments over issues of national sovereignty. We believe that the Commission on Human Rights and other relevant bodies should have their mandates enlarged beyond their present monitoring role along the lines of the relevant institutions within the Council of Europe. We look forward to the United Nations Conference on Human Rights due to be held in Vienna next year  in the hope that effective and bold steps will be taken in the endeavour further to safeguard and guarantee the fullest possible enjoyment of human rights at the individual level throughout the world. This year the General Assembly will be holding special commemorations on the conclusion of the Decade for Disabled Persons and on the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the International Action Plan for the Elderly. Over the years  Malta has taken an active role on the question of the elderly and the aged  a subject which it first brought to the attention of the General Assembly in the late 1960s. Today Malta hosts an International Institute on Aging that plays a leading role in the promotion of new ideas and training in the field of ageing. 1995  the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations  will be devoted to two important conferences relating to social development the World Summit on Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women. We welcome these  together with the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development  as a further indication of the growing commitment of our Organization to the importance of the human dimension in international cooperation a commitment which has been reinforced by the recent creation of the Office of Humanitarian Affairs within the Secretariat and which  as our Secretary-General so eloquently states in his report to the General Assembly  is renewed daily through the quiet heroism of the many individuals working in the field under the aegis of the United Nations throughout the globe. In spite of the many difficulties and recognized weaknesses  we all acknowledge how fortunate our generation is in its possession of such a global organization as the United Nations  founded upon a Charter which encapsulates the highest and most lasting ideals of humankind. It is my privilege to take this opportunity to rededicate the commitment of the Government and people of Malta to the United Nations. "
"107",4710,"MMR",47,1992,"May I begin by extending to you. Sir  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  warmest congratulations on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are confident that under your leadership our deliberations will be fruitful. Allow me also to express our admiration for the very able and dynamic manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  guided the work of the last session. His stewardship of the Assembly at a most crucial juncture in mankind's history has left an indelible mark on the institution of the presidency. The delegation of Myanmar notes with appreciation the remarkable achievements of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in the brief period since his assumption of his high office. This world Organization is fortunate to have at its helm a statesman of his stature and experience at this moment in history. He heads our Organization at a time when it is not only seized of momentous peace-keeping operations but also challenged by uncertainties in several parts of the world. May I assure him of the full support of the delegation of Myanmar. I should also like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  the former Secretary-General  for the wise and skilful manner in which he led our Organization through difficult and trying times. Within a short span of 10 months our Organization has grown rapidly with the addition of 13 new Members. The delegation of Myanmar warmly welcomes them to our midst. The admittance of those new Members to the United Nations reflects the significant changes taking place in contemporary international life and has brought the United Nations closer to achieving universality of membership. We feel sure that the new Members will have positive contributions to make to our Organization. This session of the General Assembly takes place in an international environment that is markedly different from that which existed even a year ago. Although the end of the cold war has effectively ended ideological posturing and has led to renewed confidence in the United Nations  it has  unfortunately  not eliminated all sources of strife and conflict. The recourse to arms in the Balkans  the Horn of Africa and other parts of the world serve to remind us of the fragility of peace in our contemporary world. Against that backdrop  the delegation of Myanmar is pleased to note that steps have been initiated to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to meet the twin challenges of maintaining international peace and security and of dealing with global problems. The summit meeting of the Security Council on 31 January 1992 provided an historic opportunity for taking stock of the situation and exploring ways and means of strengthening cooperation  particularly in the field of maintaining international peace and security.  The fresh look contained in the Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  is indeed timely  as the Organization  now more than 45 years old  needs to adapt to the rapidly changing world. In this process  however  care needs to be taken to ensure consistent adherence to the principles articulated in the Charter. Most important  caution must be exercised to guarantee that the sovereignty  territorial integrity and political independence of States within the established international system are not allowed to be eroded. To be truly effective the United Nations must by its own actions inspire and command the confidence of all Member countries. Its actions must be governed by a sense of justice and guided by the principles of the Charter. The decisions of the Organization must reflect that collective will and not the narrow interests or predilections of a nation or a group of nations. Any departure from those principles is bound to be divisive and to detract from our efforts to construct a fair and equitable international order. The time is ripe to examine whether the constitutional balance between the principal bodies of the Organization  particularly between the General Assembly and the Security Council  is being consistently maintained as envisaged in the Charter. If attempts at reform are to succeed  trust must prevail; and trust  as the Secretary-General states in his report  ""reguires o sense of confidence that the world Organization will react swiftly  surely and impartially and that it will not be debilitated by political opportunism or by administrative or financial inadequacy"". (A/47/277  para. 83) Transformations and uncertainties prevailing in the present international environment underscore the need for countries of the world to work together to remove the root causes of strife and conflict. The Non-Aligned Movement  whose membership encompasses close to 110 developing countries from around the globe  stands out as an organization that can not only safeguard the political  economic and social independence of its member States but also play a constructive role in charting a course to a new global order that is just  peaceful and secure. Although the world has witnessed unprecedented changes in recent years  the principles on which the Movement is firmly anchored remain as valid today as they were four decades ago. So long as the world is faced with adverse situations  and the freedom and independence of nations are challenged  and so long as the strong exploit the weak  the Non-Aligned Movement  under whatever name  will continue to be relevant. In the light of the evolving world situation the Movement can and must play an increasingly active role in international affairs to bring about a new world order of justice  peace and security. For this reason  Myanmar resumed participation at the Tenth Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  held last month in Jakarta. As a founding member we have always cherished and adhered to the principles of the Movement and are confident that we will be able to contribute positively to the long-term interests of the Movement. One field of human endeavour which has benefited from the winds of change sweeping our world is disarmament. Within the short span of a few years  there has been a significant number of agreements on disarmament that together have effectively diminished the possibility of a nuclear conflict between nuclear-weapon States. For this positive trend to continue  it is imperative that the momentum generated by the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty)  the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE)  and the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks (START) be carried forward. The agreement of 16 June 1992 between Presidents Bush and Yeltsin on further cuts in nuclear-weapon arsenals is therefore encouraging. Noteworthy also is the unilateral decision of the United Kingdom  announced on 15 June 1992  to reduce and in some instances even eliminate naval and maritime air tactical nuclear weapons. While the Union of Myanmar is encouraged by these recent measures  we believe that even more significant cuts in nuclear arsenals by all the nuclear-weapon States are called for  so as to remove the sword of Damocles that hangs over our heads. In the wake of the Gulf war and the ongoing conflicts in parts of Europe which are in the throes of transition  there is a heightened sensitivity to the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. My delegation feels that recent accession by the People's Republic of China and France to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a positive step that will buttress the existing nuclear non-proliferation regime. All five nuclear Powers with permanent seats on the Security Council are now States parties to this important multilateral instrument. This augurs well for the future of NPT  the review conference for which is less than three years away. Since the twentieth session of the General Assembly  when Myanmar joined other countries in proposing a nuclear non-proliferation treaty  we have sought an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations between nuclear and non-nuclear-weapon States. It was only because these responsibilities and obligations were unfulfilled that Myanmar did not become a signatory. Now that the principal nuclear-weapon States have initiated measures in the direction of effective nuclear disarmament in keeping with the declaration made in the Treaty and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly  the Myanmar Government has decided to accede to the NPT. Arrangements are in hand to deposit the instruments of accession in London  Moscow and Washington. In the light of the momentous changes in the world  the time has arrived for the nuclear Powers to reassess their need for nuclear testing. We continue to believe that a comprehensive test ban is an indispensable step towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. We are therefore encouraged by the decision of France and Russia to suspend nuclear tests for 1992  and hope that others will follow their good example. This year is a landmark year for chemical-weapon disarmament. The successful conclusion of a convention on chemical weapons is the culmination of years of hard work. For several years now  there has been complete unanimity in the international community on the urgent need to conclude such a convention. It was only because of the complexity of the issues involved such as on-site verification activity and national rights to economic and technological developments to be guaranteed as nations implement their obligations under the agreement that the convention took years in the making. The convention is one of the most important achievements in the history of multilateral disarmament negotiations  and the delegation of Myanmar would like to pay tribute to Ambassador Adolf Ritter von Wagner  Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on Chemical Weapons  for his unremitting efforts and to all delegations that have contributed towards the achievement of the consensus text. Myanmar has consistently sought a total ban on chemical weapons one that is comprehensive  universal and effectively verifiable. As a country that neither possesses nor manufactures those weapons of mass destruction  nor has any intention of acquiring them in the future  we welcome the convention and intend to become an original signatory. The peace Agreement signed on 23 October 1991 provided a comprehensive framework for ending 12 years of conflict in Cambodia. Myanmar  as a friend and neighbour  rejoiced at the positive development and looked forward to the early implementation of the Agreement. But today Cambodia is faced with a complex of problems. If these problems are not addressed expeditiously  both the peace and the economic development that all parties concerned are looking for will remain elusive. The United Nations has embarked on one of the most ambitious missions in its history to restore peace with the establishment of a United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). That organization is doing a commendable job in administering the country in the run-up to the elections. But to succeed it needs the support of the international community as well as the Cambodian parties concerned. We urge all parties to the conflict to cooperate fully with UNTAC in keeping with the letter and spirit of the agreement to ensure a smooth path to the elections. The Middle East question continues to be of concern to the international community. Notwithstanding the fact that the peace process has been kept alive by the ongoing talks in Washington  the question still remains unresolved. A change of attitude is essential to the resolution of outstanding issues. My delegation is encouraged to discern some flexibility now being displayed by the parties directly concerned. We continue to believe that a just  comprehensive and lasting peace in the region can be achieved only through the faithful application of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) in their entirety. In South Africa  a democratic reform process initiated last March was hailed as a major step towards the dismantling of apartheid  and the creation of  hoped that the measure would provide a fresh and compelling impetus to the negotiations taking place within the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa launched in December 1991. Unfortunately the political process was interrupted by the violence sparked by the 17 June Boipatong massacre. We welcome the recent agreement between President De Klerk and Mr. Nelson Mandela to resume the dialogue. It is our hope that common ground can be found to bridge the gap between the principal political players so that the communal violence that has rent the fabric of the South African society can be avoided and the political process resumed to achieve the goal of a peaceful transition to a democratic  non-racial and united South Africa. The global economy remains sluggish  and the prospects for its recovery are dim  particularly in the immediate future. The uncertain and unfavourable economic environment is having a negative impact on all countries  both developed and developing  but more so on the developing ones. Now is the time for the global community to make an all-out effort for the revitalization of growth. Only a more dynamic world economy can bring about world prosperity and stability. The developing countries are faced with the very difficult task of cushioning their economies against the world economic slowdown. As commodity-dependent economies  they are adversely affected by falling demand for their exports and declining world commodity prices. Commodity prices are at record low levels and are not expected to recover substantially. These difficulties are compounded by continuing protectionist trends  moves towards unilateralism  and managed trade. That is why Myanmar places great importance on a strong multilateral trading system and special significance on the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round  which is expected to usher in a more open international trade regime. There were  however  a few encouraging signs in 1991. Net transfer through direct investment showed an upward trend. Also  for the first time since the debt crisis in 1982  there was a positive net transfer of financial resources to capital-importing developing countries. On the other hand  the flow of official development assistance to developing countries stagnated. Interest rates retained their historical highs  and payment for debt service  bilaterally and multilaterally  continued to rise. There was also a further increase in the total external debt of the developing countries. Consequently the external debt problem of the developing countries remains far from being resolved  and an equitable and lasting solution to the debt crisis is urgently required. Moreover  to halt the economic slowdown and bring about renewed impetus to recovery  a determined and concerted effort by the global community  particularly by those developed countries whose policies have a direct bearing on the present state of the world economy  is a prime requisite. In the emerging new global order  the United Nations will be called upon to play an increasingly active role. The magnitude of the task ahead will require all the energy and attention the world Organization can bring to bear on them. The success of the Organization will depend on the collective will of the membership to work together to achieve the objectives of the Charter. The Union of Myanmar  on its part  will continue  as in the past  to co-operate fully with the Organization. Myanmar's manifest desire to do so is demonstrated by its actions in such areas of global concern as the environment  narcotic drugs abuse control  and human rights. Some four months ago nations of the world gathered in Rio for the historic Conference on Environment and Development;. It is now for this Assembly to take the necessary follow-up measures to consolidate and build  on the achievements attained in Rio. The three documents adopted by the Conference and sent to the Assembly for endorsement provide the broad framework for a new global partnership in our common quest for sustainable development. A firm commitment to provide the developing countries with new  adequate additional financial resources on a predictable basis is of utmost importance if we are implement the proposed plan of action to protect and preserve planet Earth. It is hopes that during the course of the present session of the Assembly concrete steps will be taken to achieve this objective. Another important task for all of us is to determine the specific procedures and organizational modalities of the Commission on Sustainable Development and give shape to it. This being the primary intergovernmental mechanism recommended by the Conference for follow-up and implementation of its decisions  the importance of the commission cannot be overemphasized. In our view the proposed commission will not only prove indispensable to affect the integration of environment and development envisaged in Agenda 21 but will also contribute to enhancing the role of this very Organization. Much has been achieved at Rio. But much more needs to be done if we are to achieve sustainable development for the common good at the national  regional and international levels. Myanmar is firmly committed to the cause of the environment and sustainable development  and in keeping with the spirit of Rio stands ready to shoulder its responsibilities. Having signed the Biodiversity Convention and the Climate Change Convention  we are now taking the necessary measures in accordance with our domestic procedures to ratify them at an early date. Since Rio we have redoubled our efforts at afforestation. We are also engaging in a nation-wide public awareness campaign stressing the need to preserve and protect the environment. We realize that the road from Rio is even more challenging than the one that led to it. We know that there is no room for complacency. Myanmar's commitment to the eradication of narcotic drugs remains steadfast. Significant achievements have been made in suppressing narcotic drugs through the relentless efforts of law enforcement personnel. As in previous years  the destruction of narcotic drug and opium refineries continues. Such an event held in Shan State on 5 June 1992 was witnessed by ambassadors  military attaches and representatives of the United Nations agencies in Myanmar. Activities in the field of medical treatment  rehabilitation and mass media information have been intensified. The problem of narcotic drugs is multifaceted and requires a comprehensive approach. While Myanmar has taken an integrated approach  utilizing sustantial national resources  it firmly believes that these efforts should be complemented by cooperation at the subregional  regional and global levels. In June of this year  Myanmar took a significant step by signing a subregional cooperative agreement with the People's Republic of China and the United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNIDCP). A similar agreement was also signed with Thailand and the UNIDCP. These agreements are aimed at eliminating opium poppy cultivation and reducing trafficking in narcotic drugs and chemicals used in the refining of heroin in the Myanmar-China and Myanmar-Thai border areas. Talks have also been initiated between Myanmar and Laos on bilateral cooperation in the control of drug abuse. It is also our intention to initiate discussions with our other two neighbours  India and Bangladesh  with a view to setting up similar cooperative arrangements. We are confident that these subregional cooperative arrangements will succeed and promote global cooperation to rid our world of the scourge of narcotic drugs. In the realm of human rights  Myanmar has been subjected to undue and unwarranted criticism from some quarters. Critics have unjustifiably portrayed Myanmar as a land where gross violations of human rights have been perpetrated this  despite the full cooperation we have extended  and are continuing to extend  to the United Nations bodies concerned with the question of human rights  providing clarification or information requested of us. We have also furnished information sought by the Commission on Human Rights and by the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. As a gesture of cooperation we received the two independent experts appointed by the Commission on Human Rights in 1990 and 1991 respectively. I should like to inform the Assembly that although we dissociated ourselves from the decision taken at the forty-eighth session of the Commission on Human Rights  we will be receiving the Special Rapporteur appointed by the Commission  in deference to the United Nations and to demonstrate our good will and cooperation. We are confident that his visit will be worthwhile. He will have the opportunity to observe at first hand the true situation obtaining in the country. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that on 24 August 1992 the Union of Myanmar acceded to the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention  thus affirming our international commitment to humanitarian principles. The principles enshrined in the Conventions are not new to us. They have been part of the educational and training process of the Myanmar armed forces and of the values cherished by our people. This year has witnessed many significant developments in our country's march towards a multiparty democratic State. These developments attest to the  Restoration Council in upholding its  assurances to fulfil its declared commitment to meet the aspirations of the people of Myanmar. In accordance with the programme of action spelled out in its Declaration 1/90 of 27 July 1990  the Government issued a follow-up Declaration on 24 April 1992 which maps out the programme to be implemented in a specific time-frame in respect of the national convention that will set out the basic principles for a new constitution. Our past and sometimes bitter experiences have shown that only a firm constitution can guarantee a strong government which will assure the peace  tranquillity and prosperity of the nation. In accordance with the programme of implementation  a 15-member Steering Committee was established on 28 May 1992. The Steering Committee met with leaders of the elected representatives of political parties and with elected independent representatives in June and July to discuss and cooordinate the category and number of delegates to be invited to the national convention. Following a free and frank exchange of views among the participants  there was general agreement that elected representatives  representatives of the political parties  the national races  peasants  workers  the intelligentsia and technocrats  service personnel and specially invited persons are to be included in the national convention. Terrorist groups which renounce the path of armed struggle and return to the legal fold will also have an opportunity to participate. There is a complete convergence of view to the effect that the constitution to be drafted should uphold and safeguard the three main national causes  namely: non-disintegration of the Union; non-disintegration of national solidarity; and perpetuation of national sovereignty. With the successful conclusion of the coordination meeting  the country has crossed a threshold  and an important political process has been set in motion. The national convention is expected to be convened at the end of the year or by the beginning of next year at the latest. To this end  a commission has already been constituted and is now actively making the necessary preparations for the holding of the national convention. Delegates representing a broad spectrum of the entire Myanmar population will identify and lay down basic principles for the drafting of a firm and stable constitution. The actual task of drafting the constitution will be entrusted to the elected representatives. In parallel with the preparations being made for the convening of the national convention  the Government has undertaken various measures designed to create an atmosphere and conditions conducive to the establishment of a democratic system in Myanmar. These include: the suspension of all offensive operations in Kayin State and other parts of the country to consolidate national solidarity and unity; the release from detention of individuals against whom action had been taken under existing laws and who no longer pose a threat to the security of the country and the lifting of restrictions on them; the reopening of universities  colleges and other institutes of higher learning that had been temporarily closed; the rescinding of the curfew order throughout the whole country; the revocation of martial law orders that had been in force since July 1989; the reconstitution of township-level Law and Order Restoration Councils that are responsible for local administration with civilian service personnel in anticipation of the future democratic administrative structure and the creation of a separate Ministry of Development of Border Areas and National Races in order to implement more effectively measures for the welfare of the national races living in the remote regions of the country. The Government of the Union of Myanmar is undertaking these measures with conviction and dedication. It is fully aware of the dangers and pitfalls faced by nations in transition from one political and economic system to another. The Government and the people of Myanmar are determined to carry out their tasks at a sure and steady pace to ensure that the aspirations of the people for a democratic Myanmar are realized."
"108",4767,"MNG",47,1992,"Allow me at the outset to convey to you. Sir  my delegation's sincere congratulations on your unanimous election to the high post of President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We are indebted to Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  whose skilful and indomitable leadership contributed a great deal to the success of the last session of the General Assembly. I extend congratulations and best wishes to the representatives of the new States Members of the United Nations: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Mongolia commends Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his dynamic performance. He has assumed the responsibilities of his post at a time when the Organization is regaining its effectiveness  and the objective of its democratization and restructuring becomes increasingly topical. I wish you success  Mr. Secretary-General  in your endeavours. I feel honoured and privilieged to address this Assembly of nations today  at a time of renewed hope in the world Organization and recommitment to the underlying purposes and principles of its Charter. I have come to this session of the General Assembly to tell the world community about Mongolia's domestic and external policies and its approaches to current international issues and to express Mongolia's full support for the principles and activities of the United Nations. As the wheel of history turns  mankind finds itself on the threshold of the third millennium. The century that started with a fierce struggle waged by the workers' movement and was two brutal world wars  a powerful movement for independence and dramatic scientific and technological breakthroughs is culminating now with a new wave of human rights  freedom and democracy. Over the past several decades the world was divided into two antagonisitc camps that grew into two powerful  confrontational alliances  but now it has witnessed the end of the cold war. One could hardly find a country in the world that had not been drawn into this truly global face-off. By indulging in ideological hostilities and a reckless arms race  mankind brought itself to the brink of self-destruction and wasted vast resources  many opportunities and much time  thereby hampering world economic development and social progress and damaging the environment. On the other hand  the colonial system collapsed and many Asian  African and Latin American countries gained independence and strengthened their positions in the international arena. Mankind has reached into outer space and started taming nuclear energy. The positive and negative effects of all this have been reflected in the activities of the United Nations  the mirror of world tendencies and international relations. The East-West cold war came to an end as a direct result of the increased interpendence of nations  the interrelationship between the political. economic and humanitarian spheres  the bankruptcy of confrontational policies and the arms race  the changes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the emergence of new thinking. Thus the 1980s and 1990s mark  in my view  the beginning of a transitional period shaping a new world order. At this very juncture  with the disintegration of the bipolar world and the creation of a multipolar one  we are called upon to determine the principles that will govern our lives and our forms of cooperation in the next century. It is vitally important to establish a new and just world order and to strengthen the ethical and legal bases for guaranteeing the fundamental principles of inter-State relations. Mongolia believes that the United Nations should be the focal point of the develoment and coordination of these processes. We therefore fully share and support the conclusions reached to that effect at the recent Stockholm Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In this context  the year 1992 could be described as a year that has strengthened these positive trends. The first ever summit meeting of the Unted Nations Security Council was held this year  demonstrating the growing prestige and increasing role of the United Nations. Mongolia fully supports the ideas and many specific proposals concerning preventive diplomacy and ways and means of building confidence  contained in the report of the Secretary General ""An Agenda for Peace"" prepared as a follow-up to the aforementioned Security Council summit meeting. The report outlines some concrete proposals on the prevention of disputes and conflicts  on increasing the role of the United Nations in peacemaking  peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building  as well as on the mechanism of ensuring the security of medium-sized and small States by political means. The importance of these proposals was most vividly demonstrated by the Persian Gulf crisis and its lessons. Today the strong cannot defy with impunity the will of the weak. Mongolia is of the view that the main lesson of this conflict is that the world community proved its determination no longer to tolerate actions in violation of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Pluralism and democracy  advancing in every part of the world  penetrate the very fabric of international relations and open up broad prospects for dialogue and cooperation. Progress has been made towards settling some regional conflicts peacefully and freeing the world from weapons of mass destruction. In this connection  I would like to note with appreciation such important events as the finalization  through consensus  of the draft Convention on the Prohibition and Elimination of Chemical Weapons; the agreement between the Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation on the reduction of the two countries' strategic nuclear weapons by the year 2003  far over and beyond the limits stipulated in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START); and the accession of the People's Republic of China and of France to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We also commend the near-nuclear countries for commencing efforts to contribute to disarmament. We would hope to see all other States in possession of nuclear weapons join the nuclear disarmament talks. In a nutshell  although it is too early today to give an exhaustive definition of the new world order  some of its principal features are already at the stage of maturing. However  these changes  which have brought about prospects of a new era in international relations  fail to prevent new outbreaks of tension that jeopardize world peace and security. The new hotbeds of conflicts are being caused by inequality  ethnic and religious strife and other complex issues of long standing. As an example of this  I would refer to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia  which is deeply troubling the world community these days. Mongolia deeply regrets the bloodshed taking place between the nations that used to share one home  and supports the efforts undertaken by the United Nations  as well as such a regional organization as the European Community  in order to resolve the crisis. We hope that the decisions reached at the London Conference will yield positive results. Mongolia holds the view that it is possible to solve the Yugoslav crisis peacefully in the manner in which the Cambodian issue is now being settled. In this connection  we would like to compliment the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  the Secretary-General and influential countries of the region that are taking an active part in the settlement of the Cambodian problem. A special feature of today's international relations is the need appropriately to combine the national interests of a country with those of the world community. From this point of view  the United Nations activities depend on the situation in and the policies of its Member States. Therefore  allow me briefly to describe the state of affairs in Mongolia  one of the Members of the United Nations  its foreign policy and security interests. The history book of Mongols consists of diverse and unique chapters: the rise and fall of the Great Empire; over 200 years under colonial rule; 70 years of Communist experiment. Today  at the turn of the century  we  the Mongols  have embarked on the road to join the mainstream of civilization. Over the two-odd years since Mongolia has irrevocably embraced democratic reforms  it has managed basically to dismantle the old social system. We support pluralism through the policies and practical activities of the State. As a result  many political parties have emerged and the conditions for democracy's steady march onward are being created. Our State structure  which was formed following the first free elections of 1990  laid down the foundations for democratic movement  took the initial steps towards a market economy and promulgated the new Constitution legally guaranteeing the continuity of democratic reforms. Last June the second elections were held  resulting in the formation of new State and government institutions and in the formulation of the next stage of the transitional period. This has become yet another guarantee of the irreversibility of our movement towards democracy and a market economy. However  a general assessment of this past period speaks of a multitude of problems  both objective and subjective in nature  in resolving political/ social and economic issues of the current period. The country lacks financial resources. And  as a result  such serious problems as the inadequate supply of food and consumer goods to the population  and raw materials  equipment and spare parts for industry  beset us. The country suffers from acute shortages of housing  medicine and other vital needs. The underdeveloped economic infrastructure and the lopsided pattern of foreign economic relations aggravate our problems. All this leads to the slump in production  to inflation and a decline in living standards. Like other developing countries  we are not in a position to cope with these vicissitudes on our own. Donor countries and international organizations have shown appreciation of our commitment to democratic reforms and the enormity of our problems by rendering support and assistance essential to us. I take this opportunity to express  on behalf of the Mongolian people  our sincere gratitude to the Governments and people of the United States  Japan  the Republic of Korea  the Federal Republic of Germany  the Netherlands  Denmark  the People's Republic of China  the Russian Federation and others  as well as to the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank  the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Development Programme for their kind cooperation. Mongolia  in its relations with other countries  has always upheld such universal principles of international relations as mutual respect for independence  sovereignty  territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs  and will continue to do so in the future. Our foreign policy has undergone a radical change over the past two years since we committed ourselves to the development of democracy and market relations  to guaranteeing human rights and fundamental freedoms. Our foreign policy has been freed from the ideological bias that had prevailed for decades. For Mongolia  which is situated between two of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  relations with its immediate neighbours have always been and will remain a fundamental factor in its foreign policy. Mongolia stands for the development of balanced relations with those two countries. We are currently reshaping our relations with them to meet the requirements of genuine equality and mutual benefit and the new realities of international politics. The withdrawal of Russian troops  in line with the agreement reached by the two Governments in the wake of the improving climate for regional understanding and cooperation  is being completed. This is in full accordance with our new concept of national security. In order to contribute to disarmament and trust in the region and world-wide  Mongolia declares its territory a nuclear-weapon-free zone. We shall work towards having this status internationally guaranteed. With the disintegration of the former Soviet Union into new independent States and the incorporation of these into the international community. Central Asia is once again emerging as a separate geopolitical entity. We believe that this vast land area  strategically located as a bridge between Europe and Asia  should be reflected in the regional representational structure of the United Nations and the land-locked position of its countries duly taken into account. I should like to take this opportunity to emphasize that we are against turning Central Asia into a nuclear testing ground. The Mongolian Government has repeatedly emphasized the possibility of developing a dialogue on a regular basis among the States of North-East Asia  an area that is home to more than one-third of the world's population and has a host of military and political  trade and economic  ecological and other pressing problems to deal with. The current climate in this subregion offers a favourable opportunity to realize such ideas and initiatives. At this point  I should like to note with appreciation the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. Other important features of our time are the increasing political and economic interdependence of nations and the intensification of regional integration processes. It should be noted that in the Asia-Pacific region  in spite of the ethnic  religious and cultural diversity as well as the disparity in the levels of economic and social development  such institutions as the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) have come into being to facilitate the processes mentioned earlier. We believe that these forums could be broadened in terms of their membership with a view to securing the widest possible representation. Mongolia's intention is to develop trade and economic relations with the countries of the region on the basis of mutual benefit and to participate actively in the international division of labour that is taking shape here.  Last year  Mongolia joined the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries as a full-fledged member. We understand this Movement to be  inter alia  an important political factor in the protection of the independence and security of small States. The contribution of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  embracing almost two thirds of the United Nations membership  is highly important in enabling the United Nations to effectively address the tasks that face it. The recent 10th Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries  held in Jakarta  has reiterated its readiness to cooperate with the United Nations in building a new world order based on law  equality and justice. We are of the view that this Summit has been crucial in responding to certain assertions and allaying certain doubts concerning the Movement's alleged loss of relevance and viability in evolving its principles and objectives in line with the new realities and in mapping out the Movement's strategies. In our view  it has also given an impetus to the expansion of South-South cooperation. With the cold-war era at an end  a propitious opportunity is now at hand for the United Nations to work unhindered towards the attainment of its objectives. The activities of the United Nations during the past two years provide a convincing example. Although the political climate on our planet is rapidly changing for the better  the same cannot be said  unfortunately  of international economic relations. We are concerned about the lack of noticeable progress in tackling the pressing issues of the world economy  especially those related to the development of developing countries and their indebtedness. Mongolia  therefore  believes that enhancing the United Nations role in developmental  efforts should constitute a major component in the restructuring of the Organization. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro  eloquently testifies to the inextricable link between environment and sustainable development. What is now required is to launch multilateral concerted action to implement the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21. At that United Nations Conference my country proposed the establishment of an international network of ecological pattern countries and the inclusion of the territory of Mongolia in it as a special zone under international protection. In doing so  we proceeded from our understanding that the preservation of Mongolia's largely unspoiled natural environment is part and parcel of global  and particularly Central Asian  ecological concerns. Our country is open to international cooperation in the implementation of research  protection and restoration programmes. We hope that the Member States of the United Nations will support our proposal and promote its realization. I should like to point out the imperative need to develop and strengthen the legal basis of inter-State relations  accelerate the codification of international law and increase the competence of the International Court of Justice  for the sake of asserting a new international order the world over. In conclusion  I should like to express my confidence that this session the United Nations General Assembly will successfully complete its deliberations. "
"109",4809,"MOZ",47,1992,"On behalf of my Government  I should like to congratulate Mr. Ganev upon his unanimous election to preside over the deliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am confident that his diplomatic skills and statesmanship will bring additional impetus to our work and contribute to the success of our current deliberations. I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the manner in which his predecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  stewarded the last session of the General Assembly. My Government wishes to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations  His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his commitment and tireless dedication to the ideals of the Organization. Though he has been in office less than one year  he has demonstrated great political ability and diplomatic skills in dealing with a wide range of delicate tasks around the globe. The Secretary-General's superior judgement and his ability to understand better the fragile nature of the emerging problems of today's world have won him high respect  confidence and admiration in the international arena. We pledge to him our continued full support. May I also avail myself of this opportunity to extend our most fraternal felicitations to the newly admitted Members of the United Nations. Their presence among us today reinforces our common objective to make the United Nations a universal instrument of peace  understanding and cooperation among nations. The current session of the General Assembly takes place against a backdrop of continued and ever-growing changes in international relations. We are witnessing a new political reality where the super-Powers' confrontation  and rivalry  in their numerous manifestations  have ceased to threaten our fragile world  a world in which an arms race between two competing blocs is no longer the main concern in the daily life of nations. A new political reality in which the problems resulting from the division of the world into spheres of influence  which had characterized international relations since the birth of this Organization  has now given rise to new hope in the search for conflict resolution. However  this new political reality brings new challenges. Although the danger of nuclear war has diminished drastically  the gap between rich and poor nations continues to widen. Uncertainty about the future continues to worry many nations and peoples; the proliferation of regional conflicts continues unabated and shows the fragility of the new political landscape. Moreover  the international economic environment remains extremely unfavourable to developing countries. We are still faced with the incommensurable problems of debt burden  deterioration of commodity prices  insufficient flow of financial resources and inadequate transfer of technology. The Uruguay Round negotiations are deadlocked  thus further exacerbating economic uncertainty worldwide. As a result  today more and more nations see the United Nations as the primary instrument for the promotion of international peace and security and of development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is illustrated by the growing number of countries that have turned to the United Nations and received assistance in their quest for democratization and their desire to strengthen respect for human rights in their respective territories. We strongly believe that the end of the cold war and of rivalry and bipolarity should serve as a catalyst for the promotion of international political  economic and social stability.  The tremendous resources  both human and material  that for over 40 years have been devoted to the purposes of self-destruction can and must now be used for peaceful purposes and economic development. History has proved that it is much easier and less costly to work for peace than it is for war. The problems ahead are still considerable  but they can be tackled and dealt with provided that there is commitment to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter at the highest political level. In these endeavours  the United Nations should be entrusted with renewed responsibilities in redirecting the use of available resources  in building confidence and trust among nations and in allocating further resources for peace-keeping  peacemaking and peace-building. It is high time for the international community to redouble its joint efforts in order to tackle with determination existing long-term problems and make the world safer for all. We live in a world full of diversity but also of similarity among peoples. While in the North man has made significant progress in mastering seemingly intractable natural phenomena and advanced sciences  such as genetic engineering  biochemistry and physics  in the South man still remains the victim of illiteracy and backwardness and depends on the will of mother nature. There are further examples which reveal our common identity as human beings - the inability to control our instincts and to manage and exercise power in a responsible manner. It is within this context that we are assembled here today as representatives of our peoples and nations in order to reflect on how to reverse the events that made it possible to devote more than $20 trillion during the past 30 years to military expenditures  to the detriment of the fundamental concerns of all mankind. In our view the root causes of the enormous problems we face today lie essentially in the utilization of the destructive capacity of man and not in the positive use of his extraordinary creativity. As has been well documented  we are currently living in a world where more than 1 billion people  or nearly one fifth of the world's population  are estimated to live in poverty. More than half of these people are believed to live below internationally accepted minimum living standards. This state of affairs has made the situation in developing countries  particularly in Africa  even more dramatic. We hope that the ending of the cold war and the confrontation between conflicting political systems will allow the international community to work together in the search for common solutions to the international problems facing us today. We come from southern Africa  a region struggling to build and reaffirm its political  economic and social identity. For many years now the peoples of the region have made tremendous sacrifices and gone through tremendous hardships in order to address the difficult problems facing the region  problems of self-determination  decolonization  destabilization and war. We have made tangible progress in this regard. Nevertheless  much more remains to be done and additional sacrifice will be required. In this connection my delegation is particularly concerned about the recurrence of violence in South Africa. The recent waves of violence in South Africa  in particular the massacres of innocent civilians in Boipatong last June and in Ciskei early this month  constitute a serious setback to the ongoing efforts aimed at creating a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement. We trust that with the support of the international community the people of South Africa can find common ground for a solution to the problems originating from the policies of institutionalized racial segregation. My Government welcomes the current efforts aimed at bringing about a resumption of talks leading towards a political settlement of the conflict in that country. We pay special tribute to the manner in which the international community as a whole  and the United Nations in particular  has promptly responded to the issue of violence in South Africa. We welcome the recent adoption of Security Council resolution 765 (1992). We wish to encourage the Secretary-General to continue to work towards the implementation of that resolution and to help avert the current deadlock in the negotiating process. We also urge all peace-loving forces in South Africa to join ranks and work together in order to find a political settlement to the problems that have resulted from nearly 50 years of apartheid  so as to ensure a smooth transition to a democratic  non-racial and united South Africa. We congratulate the Angolan people on their success in maintaining the cease-fire and in creating conditions for the holding of the first multiparty elections. It is our hope that the international community will continue to assist Angola and ensure that the elections on 29 and 30 September are held in a climate of tranquillity so that the Angolan people can freely choose their representatives. The southern African region has been stricken by an unprecedented drought with no parallel in living memory. This dramatic situation has already resulted in the destruction of this year's crops and in the devastation of the fauna and flora in large areas of the region. Important rivers have been reduced to almost a trickle of water  or even to large areas of dry sand. As a result about 20 million human lives are seriously affected; the entire region is threatened with the spectre of famine and deprivation. Last June a joint emergency appeal for relief and other emergency assistance was launched by the United Nations and the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC). We seize this occasion to thank the international community for its prompt response to the appeal  without which the human consequences of this natural calamity would have been dramatic today. We reiterate our appeal for increased and urgent assistance in order fully to meet the needs of the joint emergency appeal. In spite of the number of difficulties facing our peoples in southern Africa  joint efforts are under way with a view to revitalizing the economic and social fabric of the region. It was within this framework and with the aim of strengthening regional cooperation that we decided to establish the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). The newly born Community is a result of 12 years of experience of fruitful cooperation within the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference. The new Community bears testimony to the common willingness of the States of the region to have a gradual and balanced economic integration  based on the utilization of regional resources without  however  neglecting necessary external cooperation as a complementary factor in the prosecution of our objectives. We therefore call upon the international community to continue to extend its support in order to help the peoples of the southern African region to address the combined effects of man-made disasters and natural calamities  especially the prolonged drought. In this respect  the case of Mozambique is particularly grave as war has been ravaging the country for 16 years. The economic cost of this horrendous war  which has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and resulted in the destruction of property and the economic and social infrastructure  has been estimated to be about $20 billion. The Assembly will recall that in order to find a political settlement to the conflict in Mozambique  and taking into consideration the highest interests of the nation  direct negotiations between the Government and RENAMO have been under way for two years now under the mediation of the Italian Government  the Santo Egidio Community and the Catholic Church of Mozambique. Since last June the United Nations  France  Portugal  the United Kingdom and the United States of America have been participating as observers in the peace process. We believe their contribution  together with that of other Participants in the peace process  has brought new impetus to the process as illustrated inter alia by the signing of the Declaration on the guiding principles to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid in the country. The ongoing peace process in Rome has been complemented by other important high-level initiatives at the regional level. These initiatives culminated in the convening of a high-level meeting on 7 August in Rome between His Excellency President Chissano and the RENAMO leader. The high-level meeting resulted in the signing of a Joint Declaration. The document contains the solemn commitment by the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO to work for the completion and approval by 1 October 1992 of all outstanding issues in order to make possible the signing of the general peace agreement and to bring about an immediate cessation of hostilities by that date. The Joint Declaration outlines general principles and specific guarantees pertaining to the attainment of peace  democracy and national unity based on the overall goal of national reconciliation. It binds both sides to guaranteeing conditions allowing complete political freedom in accordance with internationally recognized democratic principles  as well as personal security for all citizens of Mozambique and all members of political parties.  The Joint Declaration further stresses the need to honour the principles contained in Protocol No. I  calling upon the Government of Mozambique ""not to act in a way that is contrary to the terms of the Protocols that are established  not to adopt laws or measures and not to apply current laws that may eventually be contrary to these Protocols"". (S/24406. annex  p. 4. para  (iv)) The Declaration also requires that ""RENAMO undertakes not to combat by force of arms after the entry into force of a cease-fire  but to conduct its political struggle observing current laws  within the framework of the existing State institutions  and respecting the conditions and the guarantees laid down in the General Peace Agreement"" (ibid.) The Joint Declaration underlines the role of the international community  in particular the United Nations  in monitoring the implementation of the General Peace Agreement and the cease-fire and the conduct of the electoral process. My Government has solemnly declared its readiness to abide by the provisions of the Joint Declaration and to work towards peace and tranquillity in our country. Even as I address the General Assembly  the Assembly of the Republic  the parliament of Mozambique  is in session in order to legislate on all the issues pertaining to the implementation of the Declaration. More recently  on 18 September  the Head of State of Mozambique and the RENAMO leader met once again in Gaborone  Botswana  in order to address the issues on the agenda of the Rome negotiations which caused a deadlock. The meeting reaffirmed 1 October as the deadline for the signing of the General Peace Agreement in Mozambique and an agreed solution was found to those issues.  Never before in the history of this conflict have peace and conciliation amongst all Mozambicans been so close. We therefore believe that RENAMO must share the historical responsibility in order to respond to the hopes of our people and turn 1 October into a historic landmark in the annals of Mozambican history. The Government of Mozambique is fully prepared to open a new chapter in our history  a chapter characterized by an atmosphere of tolerance  reconciliation and understanding among all Mozambicans. My Government long ago stated that there was no justification whatsoever for the continuation of war in Mozambique. In this connection  it should be recalled that since the coming into force of the new Constitution  in November 1990  more than 10 political parties have emerged and have been performing freely and peacefully their political activities in Mozambique. We continue to believe that all political forces inside the country should pursue their political objectives through democratically accepted norms of conduct  without resorting to violence. From this rostrum  I wish to commend the Secretary-General's personal commitment to peace in my country. We are particularly gratified to note that the United Nations stands ready to assist my country in this time of need. We also commend the Secretary-General for his recent initiative to dispatch a technical team of civilian and military experts in order to assess the needs of the country during the implementation of the General Peace Agreement  in particular the monitoring of the cease-fire and electoral process. We look forward to seeing the United Nations further involved in the peace efforts in Mozambique in the days to come. Following the signing of the General Peace Agreement  the people of Mozambique will need massive international assistance in addressing vital issues  such as the implementation and monitoring of the cease-fire  the organization and supervision of the electoral process  demobilization of both armies and the reintegration of former soldiers into civilian life  creation of the new national army  the repatriation and resettlement of refugees from neighbouring countries and assistance to displaced persons. Most important  however  it will be crucial to assist Mozambique in its national reconstruction efforts and ensure the non-recurrence of violence and destruction in the country. Such assistance will call for the creation  expansion and strengthening of democratic institutions and the maintenance of law and order  so as to deal with the growing challenges facing the nation under conditions of multi-party democracy. In Rome the Government delegation and RENAMO agreed that in order comprehensively to address the political  economic and social situation in Mozambique the convening of a donor conference immediately after cease-fire appeared to be the most viable way to complement our efforts in the important task ahead of the Mozambican nation. The United Nations and the entire international community are therefore once again called upon to extend their solidarity to the people of Mozambique at this moment  the most critical of its history since national independence. As for elections  which will take place one year after the signature of the General Peace Agreement  many efforts are being made  and there is a national political will to turn the elections into a real success  as the international community expects. However  because of the difficulties that the electoral process will encounter  we shall appreciate and acknowledge every possible material and financial assistance from the United Nations and the international community  so that the process may be conducted without major bottlenecks and be truly just  free and fair. The end of the cold war has offered good new prospects for the strengthening of North-South cooperation. The year 1992 already stands as an important landmark for the United Nations and for the future of multilateralism and international cooperation for development. In Cartagena de Indias the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) brought about a new partnership for development based on the recognition of sovereign equality  mutual interest and shared responsibilities for the goals of sustained growth of the world economy and the reactivation of development in the developing countries. My delegation welcomes the Conference's decision to redirect UNCTAD activities and to strengthen its mandate in accordance with the demands of the post-cold-war period. We wish to reaffirm our support for the Cartagena Commitment  and in this context we call for the intensification of UNCTAD assistance to the least developed countries. The Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro constituted a historic and universal gathering which set in motion a long-term process of international cooperation aimed at saving the planet and future generations from environmental destruction. It led to important and unprecedented policy agreements  a broad programme of action and two Conventions. The outcome of the Summit embodies the highest level of political commitment to sustainable development policies and practices calling for the integration of environment and development. The critical question now is the implementation of the Rio commitments and their effective follow-up and review  especially with regard to Agenda 21. In this connection  my delegation stands ready to participate in the forthcoming discussions on the establishment of the commission on sustainable development. In our view  that commission should serve as an effective mechanism at a global level for the follow-up of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and for promoting dialogue and common approaches on environment and development matters  while giving adequate attention to the diversity of situations and experiences of Member States and regions of the world. In this regard  it is our firm conviction that the composition of the commission should take into account the principle of equitable geographical distribution and provide for close working links with all agencies of the United Nations system  especially with the United Nations regional commissions and other international development institutions. Bearing in mind the follow-up of the Earth Summit  the commission should give the utmost priority to the question of the means of implementation of Agenda 21  namely  financial resources  capacity-building and technology transfer. During the past months the process of reform in the economic and social sectors of the United Nations system has evolved to the present critical stage. My delegation is encouraged by the growing consensus on  and renewed efforts to revitalize  the Economic and Social Council as a central and credible forum for dialogue and formulation of international strategies as veil as for a more effective coordination and harmonization of actions of the united Nations system. I should like to underline the great importance of the current reform exercise  which should ultimately lead to enhancing the effectiveness and efficient functioning of the United Nations system  in order to be more responsive to the current needs of international economic cooperation and to promote the development of developing countries. Likewise  we attach great importance to the reform measures aimed at improving the capacity of the United Nations to coordinate and deliver in a timely manner humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced persons  in situations both of conflict and of natural disasters. The evolving world situation has opened a new window of fresh opportunities and challenges to the whole international community and to the United Nations in particular. In this regard  my delegation has carefully studied the Secretary-General's report on the work of the Organization (A/47/1)  as well as his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). We think that the Secretary-General's assessment is very timely and pertinent in the current United Nations history. We have learned from our own experience that both an agenda for peace and an agenda for development constitute important and inseparable issues in today's world. We therefore strongly believe in the role of the United Nations as the most appropriate forum for the harmonization of the global interests of all nations and for the promotion of an appropriate political atmosphere of understanding  consensus and international cooperation among the peoples and nations of the world. May I invite  from this floor  all Member States jointly to rededicate and commit ourselves to the strengthening of the role of the United Nations  giving it the necessary thrust  so as to enable it to fulfil with zeal and confidence its tasks as the guardian of international peace and security  as prescribed in the Charter. "
"110",4854,"MRT",47,1992,"It gives me pleasure  at the outset of my statement  to congratulate you warmly on behalf of the Mauritanian delegation on your unanimous election to the presidency of our Assembly. We are confident that your ability  political experience and diplomatic skills will enable you to guide this session to its desired goals. We should like to extend our thanks also to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi  the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for the judicious manner in which he conducted the work of the past session. I should also like to take this opportunity to extend to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali our warmest congratulations on the occasion of his election to the post of Secretary-General of our Organization. We should like to pay tribute to his efficiency and the positive results he has been able to achieve in the short period he has spent in office. I should like to reaffirm to him our full readiness to work with him in any way that would contribute to the performance of his tasks. At a time when the universal character of our Organization becomes more and more pronounced through the accession of new States to its membership  I cannot but seize this opportunity to extend to those new Members our congratulations on their accession and  in welcoming them  express our confidence that they will be a new tributary of strength to this Organization. The year 1992 will always be a landmark on the road to a new type of dialogue-and-cooperation-oriented international relations. This is attested to by the high-level international meetings that have been held  and which have contributed to the emergence of new patterns of international relations. Examples of such meetings were the first summit of the members of the Security Council  the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro  the Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Dakar  and the tenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Djakarta. At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro  it became clear to all that it is no longer acceptable that islands of wealth should persist in an ocean of poverty and that international problems cannot be solved in the absence of sincere and effective cooperation between all peoples. In these international conditions of rapid change  the causes of democracy and human rights have undergone a marked development and the idea of linking social progress to economic development has gained more acceptance. This proves that no country or group of countries  no matter how powerful  can face up to the challenges of the age on its own  without extensive cooperation and consultation. However  the concept of cooperation and consultation  between countries  even if it has gained acceptance in theory  has yet to be translated into actual reality. In this context  the Rio de Janeiro Conference was a promising start. The decision of the Earth Summit to hold negotiations with the aim of developing an international convention on the phenomenon of drought and desertification is cause for optimism. It is regrettable  however  that this natural disaster has been allocated the smallest share of the resources earmarked for the implementation of the environmental programme. Mauritania  in which the bane of drought and desertification has become a chronic affliction  has formulated a programme of its own for combating desertification and correcting the imbalance in its environment. Proceeding from our experience in this area  we appreciate the difficulties of the countries which suffer from this phenomenon. I should like  on this occasion  to declare our solidarity with the peoples of southern regions of Africa and the Horn of Africa who are now suffering the effects of drought. With the ending of the cold war and its ideological conflicts  today's world faces no greater challenge than that of development. In past decades  the traditional current pattern of development proved to be deficient and incapable of achieving its goals. It is generally accepted now that alleviating poverty and even attaining a measure of economic well-being are no longer sufficient to satisfy the ambitions of mankind for progress. The social dimension of the question of development is vital for the happiness of mankind. This has proved to be true to such an extent that the advocates of absolute liberalism have come to concede that no economic progress can be achieved in the absence of a social chapter that would complement it. Hence the hope we attach to the planned world summit on social development  as such a meeting would highlight the need to link the economic and the social in development.  The world economic situation still causes concern. The most telling proof of this is that the developing countries  particularly in Africa  still face frustrating international conditions that are downright harmful  such as protectionism and the burden of foreign debt. The economies of developing countries are continuously deteriorating and poverty is increasing and spreading. Unless something is done to combat this situation  it will become impossible to build a world where stability reigns. How can we talk about a new world order while nothing concrete is done to eliminate hunger  disease and ignorance? Was it not declared in the resolutions of the first summit of the member States of the Security Council that peace and prosperity are complementary and that no lasting stability can be achieved without real international cooperation to eliminate poverty and to achieve a better life for all? And yet  there is a better chance for international cooperation because of the increasing practice of democracy in the world and increasing economic liberalism world wide. In such a context  the United Nations can play a principal role  as it is the ideal forum wherein international questions can be addressed  as best exemplified by the special session of the General Assembly in 1990 and the Rio de Janeiro summit. Those two gatherings have demonstrated that it is possible for us to conduct a dialogue between North and South and thereby to create a climate that is conducive to the promotion of development. The reorganization of the United Nations Secretariat will be an opportunity to take into account the interests of the majority of the inhabitants of the planet who face the challenge of development  and who bear the burden of its attendant fierce struggle against backwardness  ignorance  and disease. In such a context  special attention should be paid to Africa. Africa is the continent that exerts strenuous efforts in facing up to the ravages of natural disasters and  at the same time  in coping with the adverse and frustrating international conditions that stifle its growth  such as a foreign debt that now exceeds US$ 225 billion.  It has to cope with all this under the crushing impact of the increasing depletion of its sources of foreign investment. Therefore  we should provide effective support to implement the United Nations Convention on the development of Africa in the 1990s. The political support for the Convention that was announced by the latest summit in Dakar was a first step in that direction. Fortunately  the world now witnesses marked progress in the observance of human rights. However  and regrettably  there are still dark corners where the darkness has not been pierced yet by the ray of light of freedom and tolerance. How else could we explain what is taking place today in Bosnia? How else could we explain the massacres  the destruction of property  the humiliation  and the desecration of sacred shrines? Can there be any hope of putting an end to this tragedy without more pressure on Serbia by every available legitimate means to force it to comply with the will of the international community? Is it not high time for the international community to put an end to the threats to peace and the violations of basic human rights in all the world's hotbeds of tension? The World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for next year should provide convincing answers to such questions. For our part  we shall hold on to our conviction that the best possible way to ensure respect for human rights is to consider them as universal standards that must be applied in all cases  to all  without distinction. In other words  we should not confine ourselves to condemning repressive practices whenever this serves our interests and purposes. We sincerely hope that the future Vienna summit will succeed in affirming the purely humane nature of human rights as far away as possible from political or ideological considerations. While we are concerned about the world economic situation and its effects on international relations at the present time  we are hopeful that the increasing development of democratic practices will lead to more harmonious relations between countries. Mauritanians feel proud of their country's contribution in this respect. The democratic process which was launched by the Correction Movement on 12 December 1984  has culminated  this year  in the holding of presidential and legislative assembly elections within a context of political pluralism. The gradualist approach adopted in achieving this has proved to be the best way of avoiding the shocks of sudden change. Municipal elections  in various stages  gave the citizen the necessary lessons and sufficient experience to acquire a spirit of tolerance  and also tested the electoral machinery. The Mauritanian people have voted on a constitution embodying a full multiparty system for the first time in the history of the country. This constitution  which was voted upon and ratified on 12 July 1991  makes provision for all the freedoms that are set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consequently  it provides an effective basis for the rule of law under which every citizen will enjoy freedom and justice. In support of this qualitative transition  there has been a general amnesty that covered all political crimes and misdemeanours committed since the country became independent. We are therefore very happy to state that in our country today we do not have a single political prisoner. We have passed laws on the freedom of the press and freedom of political parties and political assembly which have led to the publication of 40 independent newspapers and to the establishment of 16 political parties in addition to various cultural and scientific organizations. This process has  culminated in three major events: the presidential elections of 24 January 1992; the elections to the House of Representatives on 6 and 13 March; and the Senate elections on 3 and 10 April 1992. All these elections took place in an atmosphere of freedom  tolerance and transparency which enabled everyone to see everything that was going on and to monitor it. That this was the case was confirmed by foreign observers who monitored the election process. Indeed  as one of those observers said  the real winner of the election race was the Mauritanian people. Mauritanians have turned their backs on the experience of single-party and non-democratic systems  and have chosen pluralism and real democracy  and  thus  have become the source of the authority and legality  as President Mo'awia Ould Sidi Ahmed al Tayeh remarked in his inaugural address. Our struggle is not confined to our efforts to develop democracy. We have simultaneously been waging a battle of economic reform  since 1985  by means of specific plans and programmes. What is at stake here is raising the standard of living of every citizen. Included in this campaign are the efforts to eliminate illiteracy by the year 2000 and to enhance the status and rights of women. In mentioning these efforts  I should like to extend our thanks and gratitude to all the countries and international organizations and agencies that have supported our efforts to achieve a better life for our citizens. There are clear causes for concern in the international arena. However  there are also reasons for hope. As the saying goes  life would be hard indeed were it not for hope. The Security Council has become more harmonious  which has enabled it to play a decisive role in solving international disputes. It is no coincidence that we have seen the United Nations achieving  more in the past two years in terms of the number of peace-keeping operations than it had been able to achieve over several decades. Proceeding from this  can we dream that all the peoples of the world will soon get a taste of peace in view of the steps taken to reverse the arms race and limit armaments? We now see the parties to conflicts increasingly opting for dialogue and reconciliation. This should create a favourable atmosphere to end all conflicts. Nevertheless  all these shining signs of hope along the path of progress will not be enough for the realization of peoples' aspirations for more freedom  independence and prosperity unless they go hand in hand with a serious commitment to justice.  It would be no exaggeration to cite as an example the case of the Palestinian people  who continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination and independence while their sole legitimate representative  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  continues to be excluded and its national uprising is still being repressed. Our welcome for the Madrid Conference and the negotiating process that emanated from it last autumn stemmed from our hopes for peace in the region. However  we make no secret of the fact that we are concerned at the course those negotiations are now taking. While the previous Government of Israel resorted to stalling and prevarication and had an ""anti"" position so far as any land concessions were concerned  Israel now has an administration that claims willingness for dialogue. Therefore  we hope that cooperation between this new administration and the peace-loving forces will lead to a comprehensive and definitive solution to a problem that has been with us for far too long and which has overtaxed a people which wants nothing but to achieve its rights to independence and peace. We believe the only solution is withdrawal by Israel from all the Arab-occupied territories  foremost among which is the Holy City of Al-Quds  adherence by Israel to the agreed international obligations and principles and implementation by Israel of the resolutions of this Organization. While on the subject of the Middle East and the hope that international legality may have the upper hand and put an end to the long suffering of the peoples of that area  we reaffirm our rejection of any attempt that aims at undermining the territorial integrity of Iraq and its independence as well as any action that may jeopardize the safety  security or independence of Kuwait.  While we support fully the sisterly country of the United Arab Emirates  in its demands regarding its legitimate rights over the island of Abu Mousa  we wish to express surprise at the actions of Iran in this respect and call upon Iran to deal with this problem in accordance with the agreements between the two countries within a context of good-neighbourliness  mutual respect and brotherliness. The achievement of the unity between the countries of the Arab Maghreb  which we have the honour of chairing this year  is a hope that all the peoples of the area look forward to in order for them to achieve their aspirations after integration  prosperity and development. An important area such as this  with more than 60 million inhabitants  coasts from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic  rich economic resources and a position that makes it a geographic and cultural bridge between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa  should get enough support from the United Nations to remove all the obstacles that impede its development and progress. It is no exaggeration to state that all the Arab Maghreb has been hurt by the blockage imposed against Libya. In view of the fact that Libya has declared its full readiness to cooperate with the United Nations and in view of the constructive proposals contained in the Arab League's decision 5092 of 12 September 1992  we hope the international community will show understanding for this fair position and reach a solution that will satisfy all and spare the Maghreb problems it can do without. In the Western Sahara  the United Nations  in coordination with the Organization of African Unity  continues to deploy efforts which aim at overcoming obstacles in the field so that suspicion may not replace the early optimism that prevailed in the area in the wake of the signing of the cease-fire agreement on 6 September 1991.  We are determined to continue efforts that would lead our Moroccan and Sahraoui brethren to a permanent peace that  no doubt  will be a vital factor in building the Arab Maghreb. The resumption of diplomatic relations between Mauritania and Senegal last April  the resumption of daily flights between the two countries and the opening of borders indicate the turning of a new leaf in the relations of the two countries. The resumption of cooperation between our two peoples is proof that the leaders of both countries are determined to put behind them this painful era in order for the two countries to focus on winning the battle for development. The last Nouakchott summit which brought together the leaders of Mali  Senegal and Mauritania with the aim of achieving the goals of the organization of the investment of the Senegal river  was a model to be followed in the area of common African action. In South Africa  the road to the establishment of a real non-racial democratic system is still full of obstacles despite the progress achieved over the past two years. The most dangerous obstacle is the violence that  in five years  has claimed the lives of thousands of people. Consequently  the international community should remain vigilant until the objectives of the United Nations declaration of 14 December 1989 have been achieved in full. Despite the tragedies and evils and atrocities that sadden the heart in Somalia  there are still hearts that are full of goodness. In this context  we must express gratitude to those who have helped Somalia and have made every effort to ensure arrival of their humanitarian assistance to it in the face of considerable difficulties. To all those I extend the thanks of my country and I appeal to our brethren in Somalia to let reason reign  put the national interest first and try to resolve their problems democratically  by dialogue.  In Latin America  as in Asia  we have seen how democratic development and dialogue have helped to solve many thorny problems and disputes. Two years after resolving the question of Nicaragua  peace reigns in El Salvador. The most important event in Afghanistan was the accession to power by the Mujahideen after a long devastating war. Our recognition of the new authorities in Afghanistan was an expression of our satisfaction with this development. We hope that Afghanistan  after the return of its sons  will be able to overcome factional strife and  thereby  embark on a much needed process of national reconstruction. We reiterate our support for the Paris Agreements on Cambodia  which commit all political factions to work for peace in that country. We regret the delay in implementing some of the items of those Agreements  and feel that a careful study should be made of the reasons behind such delay with a view to determining the type of measures that would enable the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia to discharge their task as fully as possible. There is no doubt that accession by the two Koreas to the membership of the United Nations is an event that justifies the hope that Korea will be unified eventually by peaceful means  through dialogue and consultation. The United Nations stands today at an important crossroads. The Organization must regain its prestige in order for it to be able to rise to the many challenges posed by the international changes on the horizon. In this context  the reorganization of the Secretariat would enable us to find the right instrument to face up to those coming challenges in which the question of development should be paramount. We have great hopes that this new era will create an appropriate atmosphere for new  more equitable and democratic international relations. Nothing can help achieve these aspirations of all peoples and nations more than justice and democracy. "
"111",4900,"MUS",47,1992,"I bring to the General Assembly the greetings of the people and Government of Mauritius. I assure you. Sir  of our unstinted cooperation and support in the discharge of the important task that you have assumed upon your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I join those who have already congratulated you on this singular honour  which is also a tribute to your country. I should like also to offer my felicitations to all the other officers of the Assembly and to wish them success as they take the reins for the current session. In addition  I want to put on record our appreciation of the masterly manner in which your distinguished predecessor conducted the affairs of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session  which was held at a time when the most crucial transformation on which the Organization has embarked was taking place. He can take pride in the commendable achievements of the Organization under his wise guidance. It is an equally pleasant duty to welcome the 13 States of Eastern Europe that have joined our ranks as members of this comity of free nations. Their membership in the United Nations can only reinforce the foundations of the Organization and make a positive contribution to the new agenda that it has assumed. The beginning of the current session of the General Assembly follows a year which was very eventful on the international scene but  more important  within the Organization itself. Indeed  during the past year the United Nations has witnessed  and in some cases has triggered  major developments.  When I addressed the Assembly during the general debate last year  I referred to the selection of a new man to take the helm of the Organization. I said that we were in a new era and that the new Secretary-General would have to tackle a different agenda and face new challenges as we approached the twenty-first century. I also said that it would be appropriate to have a Secretary-General from the South and  indeed  from Africa. In that respect we have been served well.  It is therefore with pride that I record as one of the important developments in our system the brilliant choice of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali as Secretary-General  which has kindled in many a Member nation fresh hope that its just aspirations will be addressed and fulfilled. Mr. Boutros-Ghali's election to lead this world body has been welcomed with elation by the international community  and with great expectation by those of us who are from Africa. We take pride in the fact that this wise man of proven distinguished leadership and excellence is an Egyptian son of Africa. Mauritius would like to associate itself with all those who have commended the Secretary-General on the laudable actions he has undertaken so far in his bid to initiate the much-needed reform of the Organization. It is conceded that reform of an organization like the United Nations is not an easy task  but it is more than overdue  especially at a time when the cold war has definitely been laid to rest. The drop of the curtain on the cold-war era has brought the reform and restructuring of the United Nations within the realm of possibility. The task is mammoth for sure  but it is one that is imperative  given the new priorities on the international agenda. The Secretary-General deserves all the encouragement possible in his endeavours along this difficult path. His task becomes even more exacting when it is placed in the perspective of the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of the Organization in 1995  which  incidentally  is also the year when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will come up for renewal. The years leading up to 1995 are  to our mind  absolutely crucial for the United Nations. Now  more than ever before  it is of paramount importance that the United Nations address  with renewed vigour but within the parameters of the Charter  the various and complex issues that preoccupy the international community. It is with those preoccupations in mind that we in Mauritius have welcomed the Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace"" submitted under the mandate issued at the end of the historic and first-of-its-kind summit meeting of the Security Council held on 31 January last. We share the Secretary-General's optimism when he states: ""A conviction has grown  among nations large and small  that an opportunity has been regained to achieve the great objectives of the  Charter a United Nations capable of maintaining international peace and security  of securing justice and human rights and of promoting  in the words of the Charter  'social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.'"" (A/47/277  para. 3) Yes  we agree that this opportunity must not be allowed to pass  must not be squandered. It is for us Member States to ensure that the Charter is strengthened to create the appropriate conditions for the Organization to assume the role to which we want it to aspire. Our faith in the United Nations should be reinforced  and we should match our words with action to give the innovative structures proposed by the Secretary-General a chance to work  and thus move the Organization out of the paralysis that characterized it during the cold-war era. The first steps out of this paralysis have been taken  but there are still miles to go. In our endeavours to achieve the redefined objectives meant to ensure international peace and security we must be wary that no attempt is made  deliberate or otherwise  to overstretch the interpretation of the Charter to suit any hidden political or even economic agendas. The universal membership of the United Nations should make it possible for the international community to discuss with equity  fairness and justice any issue that is likely to jeopardize or bring into question the atmosphere of international peace and security in which we aspire to live. In that perspective  I should like to commit the support of Mauritius to the proposals of the Secretary-General with respect to preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and confidence-building measures envisaged for the United Nations and its executing organs. But  as the Secretary-General has said in his annual report  the demands on the United Nations are not matched by an  equivalent provision of resources  expecially by those who can well afford such resources. The Secretary-General's report informs us that since 1988 13 new peace-keeping operations have been organized and that the Organization is at present administering 12 peace-keeping operations in various regions of the world  operations that are estimated to cost close to $3 billion in the current 12-month period. If we expect the United Nations to fulfil the new role that we are designing for it we must collectively ensure that we provide as well the financial support that it requires. It is only with secure financial foundations that the United Nations will be able to respond adequately and satisfactorily to our aspirations. I should therefore like to appeal to fellow Member States to honour their financial obligations within a reasonable time and thus remove the current pecuniary constraints faced by the Organization. I must also add that my country  which is among those Member States that religiously pay up their annual assessed contributions  will give favourable consideration to the Secretary-General's proposals to deal with the cash-flow problems  as outlined in his report. I should not like to leave the issue of reform of the Organization without joining my voice with those that have called for a review of the responsibilities of the Security Council in this changed environment of ours. We must be cautious lest we fall easy prey to the dangers that a unipolar world can trigger. It is evident that a new world order is emerging. Let us commit ourselves not to take a limited view of this new world order or  indeed  give it a limited concept. We welcome the ever-increasing activities of the Security Council to the extent that  as the Secretary-General informs us in his report  during the first 7 months of this year  46 resolutions were adopted by the Council compared to 14 in all in 1987. We should  however  beware of allowing ambiguities to crop up in those resolutions  ambiguities that may make it dangerously possible for various interpretations to be given to those resolutions  the implementation of which may perpetuate the situation of conflicts that unfortunately pervades our globe. Indeed  criticism has been levelled at the Council for its seemingly ad hoc approach to matters relating to international security. There is therefore a need to define set considerations  which  in turn  would determine what situations constitute threats to international peace and security requiring action by the Security Council. Furthermore  it has been rightly and forcefully argued that while a more vigorous and dynamic role is being envisaged for the Security Council  this magnified mandate of the Council should be matched by enhanced transparency and democracy. We fully concur with the Secretary-General  who  in the introduction to his report  while arguing that the current international situation rquires an Organization capable of dealing comprehensively with the economic  social  environmental and political dimensions of human development  underlines that: ""This requires the full application of the principles of democracy within the family of nations and within our Organization."" (A/47/1  para. 9) In this context  we await with keen interest the results of the deliberations of the high-level Working Group for the Restructuring of the United Nations set up by the recent summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Earlier on I said that while 1995 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Organization  it will also be the year when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will come up for review and renewal. Last year in my address to the Assembly  I dwelt at length on the issue of disarmament  principally because it constitutes especially to us smaller States of the world the only path to lasting security. I expressed the hope then that in the wake of the dramatic announcements made by President Gorbachev  the leader of the then-Soviet Union  President Bush and President Mitterrand the disarmament race would be confirmed. It is with deep satisfaction that my country notes the tremendous progress achieved over the past year in that race. We welcome the vote by the United States Senate two months ago for a nine-month moratorium on United States nuclear testing and an end to all such tests by September 1996  which came in the wake of the French and Russian moratoriums. Those developments lead us to assert that the time has now come for all of us seriously to consider a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty  the more so in that the international community hailed the agreement by Presidents Bush and Yeltsin in Washington D.C. in June of this year to cut the number of long-range nuclear-missile warheads on the United States and Russian sides by about two thirds. Another encouraging event in the field of disarmament has been the promise kept by China and France  which have deposited their instruments of accession to the non-proliferation Treaty. Speaking of that Treaty brings me to reiterate the dire need for an informal dialogue to be undertaken between now and 1995 between States Parties to the Treaty and non-party States  with a view to addressing in the best possible way those provisions of the Treaty that have so far prevented it from acquiring a universal dimension.  We also look forward to the establishment in 1993 of the Preparatory Committee for the 1995 nuclear non-proliferation Treaty renewal Conference and are confident that it will have fruitful and conclusive deliberations. We applaud the progress that has been achieved in the formulation of a chemical weapons convention and congratulate the negotiators in Geneva who have put in arduous hours to ensure that the target date of 1992 for the completion of such a convention be met. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Mauritius will co-sponsor with others the resolution on that convention and will be among its original signatories when it comes up for ratification. We believe that  with the end of the cold war and in this new era  complete nuclear disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction are no longer a dream but are now very much in the realm of reality. On the way towards that ideal objective  Mauritius will support all plausible initiatives  including the elaboration of a convention providing for a ""cut off"" in the production of fissile nuclear material for weapons purposes  as well as an international convention on negative nuclear security assurances. While we welcome the positive elements in the field of disarmament  some of which I have just mentioned  we deplore the continued movement of highly dangerous nuclear material on land and on the high seas. We have also taken cognizance with grave concern of the movement of plutonium and other toxic waste across the world. We exhort the countries involved in such trade to refrain from such actions and pay heed to the genuine concerns that have been expressed and continue to be voiced by the international community. Mauritius deplores the fact that some private companies based in Europe are shamefully exploiting the situations of disarray and complete chaos prevailing in Somalia to dump toxic waste on its territory  thereby adding to the calamities that are already claiming a heavy toll of human lives. The international community should  with o single voice  condemn such abominable actions. It is indeed regrettable that while we  within the context of the new role of the United Nations and other regional organizations  are trying to resolve the conflicts that beset the world  others  with no qualms whatsoever  are exploiting those conflicts for their own material benefit. As regards the situation of conflicts throughout the world  a sad sight unfolds before our eyes. In certain areas  especially after the historic collapse of one ideological bloc  new dangers loom heavily over entire populations enmeshed in ethnic and nationalist bickering. Their release from long years of repression seems to have given way to an unfortunate lust for self-destruction. We are particularly concerned at the utter lack of consideration for the value of human life and property that has become an everyday occurrence in certain parts of Eastern Europe. It is very difficult for us to accept that ethnic  religious  and nationalist feelings could be so strong as to render entire populations expendable  or that political leaders should encourage such murderous and genocidal sprees when it ought to have been possible for them to thrash out their differences peacefully through civilized negotiations. The sadness of the matter is that  while the various political groups often motivated by a misguided and exaggerated sense of territorial expansion  turn whole areas into wargrounds of desolation and lay to ruin entire cities and towns  it is the innocent civilian population that has to hold the thorny end of the stick. I do not need to retell the countless stories of atrocities being perpetrated daily in many parts of our world to convince anybody of the  kind of manmade calamity that afflicts us. Every God-given day is turned into a nightmare by the needless killings perpetrated in the name of supremacy. On the one hand  we do everything in our power to rid ourselves collectively of oppressive regimes and superficial ideologies; but on the other  once that goal is achieved we turn the guns on one another. Entire nations have crumbled over the past few months  principally in Europe and Africa. Entire populations have been decimated. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia are indeed sad and disgraceful examples of the kind of cruelty and brutality of which man is capable. On both counts  the international community has been shamefully slow in addressing the issues with a view to bringing an end to the senseless killings that have characterized the daily evolution of the situation in those countries  whose victims have been the innocent and helpless populations. What a sad reflection this is on humanity. For months we have remained impassive to the images of desolation and despair  of emaciated fellow beings too sick and too weak to move  of mutilated people degenerating into apparitions of skin and bones - images brought to us in the comfort of our living rooms on the small screen. The Somali human rights disaster for indeed that is what it is has been left to simmer for months unheeded. This brings me to address another area of priority on the international agenda the issue of human rights. It has been known since time immemorial that man as an individual has a capacity to go to extremes. As capable as he is of displaying a depthless sense of compassion and love  he is just as able to manifest a diametrically opposed and excruciating sense of cruelty and oppression towards his fellow being. But when such harassment and privation of man's basic rights become institutionalized  it is a matter of distress that should be the concern of the international community. One cannot talk of economic development and progress on the one hand without on the other hand ensuring that man who remains at the centre of development and therefore of progress is not prevented from enjoying his dignity  nor divested of his basic freedoms and rights. The promotion and upholding of human rights should remain high on the international community's list of priorities. In fact  as the Secretary-General reminds us in his report  the Charter of the United Nations makes the promotion of human rights one of our priority objectives. Constant dialogue with a view to defusing any situation in which human rights have been breached should be encouraged and welcomed at all levels. Human rights are indivisible. Political  social  civil and economic rights are fundamental to humanity in its quest for progress and its endeavours towards the economic and social improvement of its environment. That is why we in Mauritius staunchly support those who believe that concern for human rights and the promotion and defence thereof cannot be considered as interference in the internal affairs of a State where that State displays an arrogant disregard for the basic rights and freedoms of its people. We believe that violations and gross abuse of human rights should be decried forcefully. In the same manner that the international community has with one voice condemned apartheid as a human rights abuse  it should be free and honest enough to point the finger at those who continue to thwart the efforts of man to assert his dignity. If we can without restraint declare ourselves against such scourges as apartheid  racism and xenophobia  we should equally be at full liberty to denounce those who for archaic or obscure reasons but often out of self-interest deny their fellow beings the freedom to exercise their basic rights. We therefore condemn without reserve those who  for political expediency and/or survival  find it necessary in the normal course of events to deprive their people of civil and political rights to the extent of imprisoning and even exterminating those who militate for such rights. We also view with grave concern those cases in which human rights monitors  local or international  have been arrested  jailed  or even killed while trying to come to the assistance of populations that are victims of human rights deprivation. However  we should like to appeal to the donor community to ensure that  while withholding or cutting off aid and assistance to any country or region as a punitive measure against regimes guilty of gross violations and abuse of human rights  nothing be done to exacerbate the plight of innocent people whose lives are already miserable as a result of their being deprived of their basic rights. After all  human feelings and therefore humanitarian compassion should transcend political considerations. A people afflicted by severe human rights abuse should not be made to endure further suffering by being deprived of much-needed assistance. With a view to addressing serious human-rights-abuse situations in certain territories in a positive and constructive manner  we are fully supportive of the idea that the General Assembly or the Security Council should be able to entrust the Secretary-General with mounting fact-finding missions to those territories  either at the request of the Government thereof or at the behest of the appropriate organ of the United Nations itself subject  of course  to prior arrangements having been made with the States concerned. We must here commend the work done by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and Human Rights Committee  the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva and the Committee on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights  as well as the various non-governmental organizations which have been playing a crucial role in the protection and enhancement of human rights. We must also place on record our appreciation for those States that have legislated appropriately to give human rights the protection of the law and make their enjoyment a matter of course. In the context of the international concern for human rights  we hope that the opportunity provided by the second World Conference on Human Rights  to be held in Vienna in June 1993  will be seized by all concerned to pledge themselves to the universal upholding and promotion of human rights. Respect for human rights must become a cardinal characteristic of all Governments. A passionate debate is currently on regarding the relationship between democracy  development and human rights  as indeed on the issue of human rights and sovereignty. We believe that the 1993 Conference will be the perfect platform to debate these issues sufficiently for universal norms thereon to emerge. I should like to seize this opportunity to wish the Preparatory Committee in Geneva success in the work it has started. The upsurge of racism and xenophobia in certain countries of the West is also a matter of great concern to us  and we consider the discrimination in the treatment of migrant workers and foreign students in those countries a human-rights violation. It is a matter of deep regret that some countries that have come to the fore as champions of human rights should themselves be found wanting on that level. Let them put their human-rights house in order first before decrying and acting on violations beyond their frontiers. Similarly  some countries that are quick to denounce human-rights abuse do not always abide by the consistency that is required in such matters. We firmly believe that the same approach should be applied in all cases of alleged human-rights abuse  whenever they may occur. No political or economic interest should interfere with that approach. Picking and choosing between countries will only make a farce of the human-rights issue. I now wish to touch briefly on a few issues that are of specific importance to us in Mauritius. The unfortunate turn of events in South Africa  in particular the Boipatong massacre and the Bisho killings  has dampened the ardour with which we were anticipating the accession of the Republic of South Africa to the fold of free and democratic countries of the world. We call on all the parties concerned in the South African arena  and especially those currently in power  to recast their bearings in as positive a way as possible to ensure that the objective we dream of for that country is achieved in the not-too-distant future  so that every citizen of the nation that will emerge can start working towards its reconstruction based on freedom  peace  equality and justice. We are hopeful that the wisdom of the leaders involved and the encouragement of the international community will make it possible for the stalled negotiations to be resumed  for the benefit of all South African citizens.  In neighbouring Mozambigue  a breakthrough had appeared at hand as all parties concerned declared their readiness to work for the progress of that country in the wake of the recent negotiations aimed at ending years of civil strife. We hope that last-minute snags will be overcome in a spirit of compromise so that peace can at last prevail in the better interests of the population.* Similarly  we are encouraged by the ongoing Middle East peace talks. We must  however  constantly remind ourselves that the crux of the matter remains an equitable and just solution to the Palestinian issue. The scourge of famine and drought that continues to take its toll of lives on the African continent  especially in its southern part and in the Horn of Africa  is a matter of deep concern. We would like to see the international community act more urgently to stop the dreadful loss of life that has become a daily occurrence in many countries of that region. Mauritius is ready to contribute within the possibility of its means to any action aimed at alleviating the plight of those unfortunate and often forgotten souls. Another issue that is of great importance to us in Mauritius is the need to respect the territorial integrity of nations. I should here like to place once more on record the appreciation of my country to all those countries that have consistently expressed their support of our sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia. We should like to inform the Assembly that we have resumed exchanges with the United Kingdom on this issue. In my address to the Assembly last year  I expressed the hope that the leaders of Fiji would redress the situation that prevails there by amending its present Constitution to the satisfaction of all the citizens of that sister island nation. Mauritius draws comfort from recent assertions by the Prime Minister of that country that he is morally committed to reviewing the Constitution of the land. We are confident that the Fijian Government will now act on the basis of those assertions and make it once more possible for the Fijian citizens  irrespective of the community to which they belong  to work hand in hand for the progress of their nation. Similarly  we commend the authorities of that other neighbourly sister island of Sri Lanka for the efforts being deployed to put an end to the unfortunate strife that has ravaged their country and taken such a heavy toll of human lives. We are confident that with a reasonable degree of compromise on all sides  peace and harmony will prevail anew there. Finally  allow me to reiterate the continued faith of my country in the collective wisdom of our Organization and pledge anew our unstinting support for its laudable efforts  under the skilled and enlightened leadership of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to address the political  social and economic obstacles that remain strewn on the path to harmonious coexistence and global progress. "
"112",4937,"MWI",47,1992,"On behalf of the Malawi delegation  I wish to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. We have no doubt that under his leadership and guidance  the session will be a success. We also congratulate his predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for a job well done. Mr. Shihabi presided over the forty-sixth session of the Assembly effectively  and we wish him well in the future. On behalf of the Malawi delegation  let me also take this opportunity to applaud our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his steady stewardship of the Organization as it continues its work of maintaining international peace and security  as well as the promotion of social and economic development around the world. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali has been in office for less than a year. Yet his laudable achievements in charting the Organization towards the United Nations perceived by its founders  a United Nations that plays a leading role in the maintenance of international peace and security  particularly in preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping  are very clear to us all. His determined efforts in focusing attention on poverty reduction and economic development in the third world have also been notable. We assure him of Malawi's complete support and wish him success. We also pay a tribute to all his staff for their dedication to duty  at times in circumstances of extreme personal danger. It is with great pleasure that we join all those who have spoken before us in welcoming to the United Nations the 13 new Members. We wish them well. The near universality that this new membership has brought us will definitely contribute to making the United Nations stronger. My delegation is pleased to note from the Secretary-General's report to the Assembly that the past 12 months have been characterized by general international peace and security. Certain areas and regions  however  remain zones of strife and conflict  posing a grave danger to the efforts of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. In this regard  my delegation is equally concerned at what is happening in the Balkans  in particular the suffering and death of innocent civilians  especially young children  women and old people. The fighting and shedding of innocent blood must stop. Malawi supports the efforts of the United Nations and the European Community to provide humanitarian relief supplies to Sarajevo and other beleaguered parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also support the determined efforts now in progress to establish a cease-fire and to arrive at a peaceful solution to the problems confronting all the parties to the conflict. Dialogue between the various parties is the answer and an essential condition to the achievement of peace and stability in that region. Regarding the Middle East  Malawi welcomes the landmark developments on the protracted and problematic issues relating to the Palestinian question. Malawi welcomes the United States/Russian-brokered peace initiatives. The Malawi delegation joins all those who have spoken before us on this issue in wishing the peace process success. The situation in Somalia is a source of concern to all peace-loving countries. My delegation is pleased to note  however  that through the determined efforts of the United Nations and in particular of the Secretary-General  the mayhem taking place in Somalia before our very eyes is at last being addressed by the international community. The deployment and the increase in the number of United Nations security guards from 500 to 3 500 will help curb the serious security problems and make possible the airlift and distribution of desperately and urgently needed humanitarian supplies such as food  medicine and clothing. My delegation commends the United Nations and its lead agencies  the donor community at large and non-governmental organizations  such as the International Committee of the Red Cross  Medecins Sans Frontieres  Oxfam and others for their dedication and for their tremendous achievements in very difficult conditions. Somalia needs peace and reconciliation. In this respect  Malawi applauds and supports the combined efforts of the United Nations  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference in working tirelessly towards the achievement of peace and stability in that country. On behalf of the Malawi delegation  I take this opportunity to welcome the peace accord that was signed in Rome on 4 October 1992 between President Chissano and Mr. Afonso Dhlakama  the leader of RENAMO. It is common knowledge that Malawi has a direct interest in the establishment of peace and stability in Mozambique. Indeed  over the years Malawi has been involved in the search for peace in that country. The end of the 16-year civil war means the end of untold suffering for the people of Mozambique and a wonderful opportunity to focus their energies and resources on the reconstruction and development of their beautiful country. For Malawi  this  also means that the Nacala and Beira corridors  our most cost-effective routes to the sea  will begin to function at full capacity. We therefore have every reason to rejoice at this welcome development. The international community is also aware that Malawi has through the years been host to more than 1 million refugees from Mozambique. It is our sincere hope and prayer that the cease-fire holds and peaceful conditions are established that will allow the refugees to return to their homes in honour and in dignity. Malawi considers the role of the international donor community and the United Nations  especially that of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  to be extremely important in facilitating the return and resettlement of the refugees as well as the internally displaced people. Massive assistance will be required to enable Mozambique to forge ahead in its enormous task of reconstruction and development. My delegation wishes to reiterate the Malawi Government's readiness and commitment to assist  within its means and capabilities  in these arduous tasks. The situation in South Africa continues to be a source of concern to my Government. Malawi holds the view that there is no better alternative to dialogue for resolving the political problems in that country. That is why we welcomed the negotiations under the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) process  and were therefore disappointed by the wanton cycle of violence that led to the suspension of CODESA. We believe that peace must be re-established for negotiations to take place. It is in this context that the Malawi Government welcomed the appointment of a Special United Nations Envoy on South Africa and fully supports Security Council resolution 772 (1992)  which provides for the increase - from 30 to 50 in the number of observers to monitor and help curb the violence taking place in that country. Malawi also welcomes the initiative taken by the OAU  the European Community and the Commonwealth to cooperate with the United Nations in contributing additional observers. The Malawi Government has been encouraged to note that the people of South Africa themselves continue to believe in the effectiveness of negotiation as the path towards peace and security. We therefore welcome the agreement reached recently between the President of the African National Congress  Mr. Nelson Mandela  and the leader of the South African Government  President F.W. de Klerk  to resume constitutional negotiations. In welcoming the agreement between Mr. Mandela and President de Klerk  my President  Ngwazi Mr. H. Kamuzu Banda  expressed his hopes for a future South Africa as follows: ""I do hope that [Mr. Mandela]  together with President De Klerk and others  can bring real peace to the South African townships  and put an end to the human suffering there. We look forward to the time when a non-racial democratic South Africa will take its place among the nations of our region in particular and the world in general."" Malawi joins all those who have spoken on the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED)  held in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  this past June. By all accounts  the Conference was a historic milestone. Malawi took part in the Conference and was one of the many countries that signed the Convention on biological diversity and the Convention on climate change. Although the two Conventions did not meet all the demands and expectations of the developing countries  it is Malawi's view that they generally present a major framework for progress towards the goal of protecting and preserving the environment.  Malawi  as a developing country  looks forward with hope to the post-UNCED period. The implementation of the programmes which make up Agenda 21 is the key to the success of UNCED. We therefore welcome the impending establishment  during the course of this session of the General Assembly  of the commission on sustainable development to oversee the implementation of Agenda 21. We hope that within the framework of this institutional machinery  supported by the United Nations system as a whole  the new global partnership between North and South will make possible the transfer of technology and  even more critically  the financing of Agenda 21. Malawi appeals to the developed industrialized countries to honour their commitment to meet the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance and to honour their pledges to increase their assistance in order to ensure the full implementation of Agenda 21. We also welcome the efforts by the World Bank  the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Development Programme to restructure the Global Environmental Facility to make it transparent and flexible in order to achieve a wider coverage and scope in its operations  especially with regard to the financing of Agenda 21 programmes. The Malawi delegation would like to add its voice to the debate on the restructuring and reform of the United Nations system. The aims of the reform include eliminating the duplication of functions and rationalizing and revitalizing the Organization's operations. Malawi supports the initiatives which the Secretary-General is taking. Change is an on-going process and is necessary if the United Nations is to be able to respond effectively to the new challenges and opportunities that are so evident in this post-cold-war However  Malawi is of the view that these on-going changes should not lead to a deviation from the purposes and principles of the Charter. It is in this vein that the Malawi delegation welcomes the measures taken to restructure and revitalize the Economic and Social Council as well as the establishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs  which is already playing a major role in dealing with the drought emergency situation in Africa. Malawi  like the other countries in southern Africa  is experiencing the most serious drought in living memory. The drought situation has had a major debilitating effect on the country's development efforts. National food production has been severely affected. The country  which is normally self-sufficient in food  is now facing a shortfall in maize  the national staple  of more than 690 000 tonnes. There are also shortfalls in pulses  edible oils and salt. This serious situation has been compounded by the cross-border movements of persons looking for food or running away from civil strife. Even cash crops  which earn Malawi scarce foreign exchange and afford the local Malawians a source of income to live decently  have also been adversely affected by this drought. Disease and malnutrition are on the increase. All this is having severe adverse effects on the socio-economic development of our country. We have been encouraged by the many nations and international organizations that have come forward to assist Malawi  as they have done in respect of the other countries in our region. However  in spite of this generosity  the situation in Malawi remains critical. Major shortfalls in food  medicines and water supplies still exist. For example  over 50 per cent of our food aid needs have not yet been met. We are also experiencing serious problems in meeting costs for internal transportation  storage  fumigation. water supply  health and nutrition. We therefore renew our appeal for more urgent assistance to avert any further worsening of the situation. In recent months serious guestions have been raised about Malawi's human rights record. As a result  a number of our partners in development have withheld or reduced support for the country's development programmes. In its independence Constitution of 1964 Malawi recognized the sanctity of the personal liberties enshrined in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Malawi continues to respect these personal liberties. Malawi has gone even further. It is party to a number of human-rights instruments  including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Malawi became a party to these important instruments aware of its commitments as a member of the community of nations. In a key address to the nation on the eve of the celebration of Malawi's 28 years of independence on 5 July 1992  our Life President  Ngwazi Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda  reaffirmed the emphasis placed by the donor community on human rights and good governance for development assistance. In keeping with this commitment  Malawi has recently embarked on a vigorous programme of action aimed at a transparent demonstration of its continued respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  at the policy level and in practice. It is not possible  in the time available to me  to give a comprehensive review of the Malawi Government's programme of action. I can only give a few examples of the developments that have taken place so far. As I speak  all political detainees in Malawi have been unconditionally released. In addition  the Government of the Republic of Malawi has amended the Preservation of Public Security Act with a view to giving all those detained under the Act the opportunity to have recourse to the legal process through an open court or a tribunal. Secondly  the Malawi Government has invited the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit prisons and places of detention and to interview inmates about their conditions and treatment. The Government of the Republic of Malawi has agreed that it will be happy to work with the ICRC on its recommendations. In a separate but related exercise  the Government of Malawi has set aside funds to improve prisons as well as to speed up the handling of any backlog of untried cases. To improve prison conditions further  the Government is putting together a project proposal. We hope that this project will receive donor support. The Malawi Government has also recently amended the Forfeiture Act  which was enacted to curb the plunder of the economy by unscrupulous businessmen. However  in order to ensure that the practical application of the law is consistent with the spirit in which it was enacted. Parliament has recently passed an amendment with a view to allowing persons to be heard in their own defence in the High Court before they are declared to be subject to forfeiture. The Government of the Republic of Malawi has also initiated a dialogue with the press to promote the exercise of freedom of expression and freedom of the press. To improve the atmosphere further  last week our President appealed to all Malawians to engage in constructive discussion amongst themselves on issues of national importance. My delegation wishes to reaffirm Malawi's continuing commitment to the promotion of human rights and individual liberties and to assure our partners in development and all others that the Malawi Government remains ready to maintain a constructive dialogue with them on these questions. Finally  I should like to thank the United Nations system and all the friendly Governments and non-governmental organizations for assisting Malawi in all its endeavours towards raising the standard of living of its people."
"113",4983,"MYS",47,1992,"I should like at the outset to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Ganev of Bulgaria on his election as President of the General Assembly at its forth-seventh session. I am sure that with his experience and skill he will guide the Assembly to a successful conclusion. I should like also to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to his predecessor  Mr. Samir S. Shahibi  who carried out his tasks with dedication and commitment. He made an invaluable contribution to the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. It is also a pleasure for me  on behalf of Malaysia  to extend a warm welcome to the delegations of those countries that recently joined us as Members of the United Nations. . In the last two to three years we have seen dramatic developments and changes around the world. In many ways we are at a historic point  where we must make fateful choices that will determine the future of mankind. There are opportunities to develop a new era of international cooperation based on a collective desire to seek social and economic progress in a peaceful and stable environment. There are renewed hopes in the ability of the United Nations to play a central role in the maintenance of peace and security  while at the same time being the catalyst for the revival of international develolpment cooperation. The end of East-West rivalry and the success of the role of the United Nations in settling a number of regional disputes understandably gave rise to euphoria about a new world order. Unfortunately  events of the last two years prove that such euphoria has been rather short-lived. Numerous and complex challenges  as well as uncertainties  are still unfolding. Sadly  the dawn of the new post-cold-war era is looking more and more like the old world order  characterized as it was by open conflicts based on clashes between competing nationalists and ethnic forces. Certain parts of Europe are once again becoming areas of tension and destruction  with ugly ethnic and nationalistic strife in the former Yugoslavia and a number of component States of the former Soviet Union. There are also disturbing unresolved local conflicts in other parts of the world in Afghanistan  Liberia  Mozambique and Somalia. Indeed  our initial hope and confidence that the end of the cold war would encourage and bring about better cooperation at the United Nations are on the wane. Experience over the last several months has raised serious concern about certain developments at the United Nations. Too much emphasis  for instance  is given to the role of the United Nations in the maintenance of international security  and there is less focus on the social and economic dimensions of peace. There is also concern over the dominant role of certain permanent members in the decision-making process in the Security Council  pushing the scope of the Council's activities into areas considered by many to be beyond its mandate. There is also growing concern that the Security Council particularly the permanent members - has a tendency to select when and where to apply collective measures under the Charter to uphold the rule of law and restore international peace and stability. One obvious example of such selectivity is the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council has yet to respond to requests by a number of countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference for an emergency meeting  with formal debate  to consider the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  much less to invoke Article 42 of Chapter VII of the Charter. To uphold the rule of law  the Council should reverse the aggression by Serbia-Montenegro against Bosnia and Herzegovina and should initiate legal proceedings against Serbian leaders and individuals responsible for ""ethnic cleansing"" and other war crimes against Bosnian Muslims and Christians. The London Conference has yet to prove effective  and even the latest Security Council action  expanding the size and mandate of the United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia is limited to the protection of humanitarian relief. It is Malaysia's strong belief that humanitarian relief  however effective it may be  will not bring an end to aggression and atrocities  which are causing so much destruction and loss of life  as well as outflows of refugees to neighbouring countries. The case of Bosnia and Herzegovina has highlighted the need for  and the importance and validity of  preventive diplomacy. If the United Nations is expected to play an effective role in the maintenance of international peace and security  there must be greater recourse to preventive diplomacy. Selectivity or double standards in dealing with potential conflicts and with the parties involved would lead us nowhere and would only make a mockery of the United Nations. We are all conscious of the fact that the grave situation in Somalia was largely ignored by the Security Council until the Secretary-General took the Council to task. Millions of Somalians have been suffering for months  and many are dying by the day in a tragic civil war that is raging out of control. Somalia is in many ways a casualty of cold-war politics and is now left to struggle on its own. In this instance the United Nations must assist not only in bringing humanitarian relief as is being done - but also in restoring normality. Continuation of the civil war in Somalia is of no good to any party  and we urge the warring parties to settle their conflicts speedily and peacefully for the sake of their people and country. There is a Malaysian proverb that aptly describes the futility of such a situation: ""The victor becomes charcoal  and the loser the ashes."" Two international issues that have long been on the agenda of the United Nations are Palestine and South Africa. The current Middle East peace process is showing signs of progress as  for the first time  negotiation  begin to enter into substantive questions touching on the principle of land for peace. The time has come for the United Nations to be involved in confidence-building measures in the occupied territories  including the dispatch of observers  as well as the extension of social and economic assistance beyond the current limited efforts of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to help the Palestinians during the period of transition towards self-rule and independence. Similarly  in South Africa  the process of change towards democracy and majority rule has reached a critical impasse  which calls clearly for a more assertive and tangible United Nations role. Malaysia welcomes the decision of the Security Council to send observers to help to create confidence and to facilitate the process of change. But we believe that the United Nations should be able to do more in extending confidence-building measures particularly in restoring law and order as well as in looking at the needs of black South Africans living in squalid conditions  long neglected under the apartheid system. On the question of Cambodia  Malaysia  being part of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the region  has a special interest in Cambodia's peace  stability and economic well-being. Bilaterally  Malaysia stands ready to join hands with its Cambodian neighbours in economic and technical cooperation. We are also fully supportive of the United Nations role in Cambodia and we are doing what we can to both assist and support the United Nations peace-keeping efforts. To date we have already contributed a total number of 1 060 men to the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The task before UNTAC is certainly not an easy one in facilitating the process of national reconciliation and paving the way for the setting up of a freely elected democratic Government. Actions of some Cambodian parties could well threaten the Paris peace Agreements. Clearly  the Paris Agreements must be fully implemented and the United Nations is there to ensure such a course. Also the United Nations  as represented by UNTAC on the ground  in its unique role in Cambodia  must gain the full confidence of all parties in order to facilitate implementation of the Agreements in the peace process. The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and in Somalia  is a serious test of the credibility of the United Nations concept of collective security. At a time when there is such enormous expectation concerning  and reliance on  the United Nations collective security system to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security  there is an urgent need to examine the Charter and functioning of the collective security system. Under Article 24 of the Charter  Members of the United Nations confer the responsibility for maintaining international peace and security on the Security Council and the Council acts on their behalf. The general membership of the United Nations surely has the right to expect transparency and accountability in the work and actions of the Council. A major reform of the Council to achieve such transparency  accountability and democracy is overdue. The Council's present membership of 15 must be increased to a level that is more representative of the United Nations general membership  which has now grown to 179 countries. The representation of Europe in the Council far outweighs the size of Europe. The present constitution of the permanent membership largely reflects the situation immediately after the end of the Second World War and has now become untenable and anachronistic. The veto power which guarantees the exclusive and dominant role of the permanent five in the Council must be examined anew. Malaysia will contribute to examining in all aspects the structures of the United Nations. We regard as timely the decision of the recent tenth non-aligned summit meeting in Jakarta to establish a high-level working group to pursue the restructuring  revitalization and democratization of the United Nations and will give it our full support. Malaysia would also support a collective effort by the General Assembly to study the content and conseguence of the extremely valuable contribution of the Secretary-General in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"". We hope that a collective examination in a democratic fashion will help to define clearly the important principles contained in the document and the actions contemplated as a programme of action for the United Nations in a changing world order. The time has also come for us to treat the financial crisis facing the United Nations as a matter of utmost urgency if the Organization is to be the foundation and centrepoint of the post-cold-war world order. The increasing demands on the United Nations to undertake peace-keeping operations around the world are overstretching its scarce resources. Arrears for both regular and peace-keeping budgets now stand at around US$1.75 billion and they are affecting adversely the ability of the United Nations to perform its tasks. Of particular concern is the fact that more than half of the total arrears is owed by two of the five permanent members. Malaysia  like many other developing countries  welcomes the bilateral agreements reached between the United States and Russia on nuclear-weapons reduction and arms control. As a strong proponent of a universal disarmament process within the United Nations framework  Malaysia welcomes the positive work of the Conference on Disarmament on the proposed chemical weapons Convention and we are happy to cosponsor a draft resolution on it at this session of the General Assembly. Malaysia also believes that the process of transparency and confidence-building would contribute to the general goal of disarmament and peace  and we support the idea of a United Nations register on armaments. Such a register  however  should not be limited only to the sale and transfer of conventional weapons but should also include the production and stockpiling of conventional weapons and in due course cover non-conventional weapons. The suitability of the United Nations as the focal point for international cooperation to build a new world order is its noble objectives and universal character. For it is here that sovereign States are equal partners  and hence the Organization provides a good starting point for instituting democracy in inter-State relations and multilateral diplomacy. Unfortunately  since the collapse of communism there has been an increasing tendency on the part of the victors of the ideological rivalry to dictate their values relating to human rights and democracy to others  not only in the conduct of their bilateral relations but also in their activities at the United Nations and in its bodies. Malaysia believes that a comprehensive and constructive treatment of human rights issues must certainly take into consideration the cultural and religious values that influence the national outlook and development of Member States. We look forward to participating in the World Conference on Human Rights next year. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is an important instrument for the maintenance of law and order in maritime affairs and for international cooperation. As a littoral State  Malaysia would like to draw the Assembly's attention to the use of the Straits of Malacca as a waterway for international shipping. Larger and faster vessels capable of carrying cargoes of a previously unimaginable magnitude now ply the Straits in record numbers. Most of them are expected to share the same narrow waterway with fishing boats and the ever-growing number of pleasure craft. The increasing international traffic and the passage of large sophisticated vessels through our waters have certainly landed us with new problems  risks and responsibilities. In particular  the passage of tankers carrying dangerous and hazardous cargo adds to our worries and the risks to our environment. There have already been cases of collisions and spillage in the Straits  polluting our sea and shore and affecting our marine resources.  The latest collison  last weekend  between two vessels in the Straits  involving an oil tanker and a container is a glaring example. When such accidents occur we have to do the clearing up  which is a financial burden  and endure the sudden harm and destruction to our marine resources caused by pollution. This is too much for the poor littoral States to bear alone. Obviously there is an urgent need to take a fresh look at existing international maritime law and regulations applicable to the Straits and find a mechanism to share the responsibility of ensuring the safety of navigation  as well as collectively to combat the growing piracy with effective surveillance through the use of advanced eguipment and with the improved resources at our disposal. To meet such objectives Malaysia is not suggesting the introduction of levies or collection of dues but is asking for the operational and financial responsibility for this to be shared eguitably among the maritime nations  users of the Straits and the littoral States. Any attempt at building a new world order must address the increasing inequity in the international economic system resulting in a widening North-South gap. The 1992 United Nations Pevelopment Programme human development report  for instance  in highlighting the increasingly difficult external economic environment and its adverse repercussions for developing countries  has stressed that the North must be held primarily responsible for this situation. The report pointed out that protectionism and subsidies in the developed countries resulted in a loss of $500 billion a year for the developing countries  ten times what they received in foreign assistance. The total external debt of developing countries has multiplied thirteenfold in the last two decades  from $100 billion in 1970 to around $1 350 billion in 1990. While the deadlock in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round has yet to be resolved  recent tendencies towards unilateral protectionist trade actions  the creation of new trade blocs and instability in the major currency markets would only worsen the already difficult global economic environment. Nothing short of a major reform and restructuring of the world economy  including the financial system  is required in order to bring about a strong revival and ensure its long-term stability. In recent years some progress has been made towards revitalizing and restructuring cooperation in the economic and social fields at the United Nations. But those changes  no matter how constructive and well-meaning  are not sufficient to revive international economic cooperation and to allow for global social development for as long as the developed countries are not prepared to initiate concrete changes at the policy level and to fulfil their obligations  particularly in terms of meeting the official development assistance targets. The Rio de Janiero summit on environment and development has raised the hopes of many that we have  within the context of the decisions of the summit and the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Pevelopment  set the framework for launching a new global partnership with a view to economic development and the protection of the environment. However  real success is dependent upon the availability of new and additional resources as well as on the transfer of technology from the North to the South. As agreed at Rio  we are expecting our partners in the North to make their pledges during this session of the General Assembly. The world today has reached a defining moment in history. The imperatives of global interdependence require that we members of the international community work closely together in a new global cooperative spirit to move away from the past decades of ideological confrontation towards the building of a better world for all. In this regard the United Nations remains the best forum and vehicle for bringing about a new global consensus for international peace  security and development. Together  as a family of nations  we must have the vision and courage to address our common interest and future. "
"114",5010,"NAM",47,1992,"Since its inception in 1945  the United Nations has spearheaded humanity's common yearning for a peaceful  just and prosperous world  a world freed at last from war  caprice  greed and other abominable human and social impulses. The brilliant and forward-looking authors of the Charter of the United Nations and the rest of us who are the beneficiaries of their collective wisdom and imagination have reason to hope for a firm consolidation of a democratic  stable and compassionate world order  which would make a clean break with the past  characterized by two unprecedented and most destructive world wars in this century.  This world order  the optimists proclaimed  would be governed by the rule of law  respect for human rights  universal exercise of the right to self-determination  recognition of the equality of all nations  large and small  and sharing among the members of the human family. On this basis it was fair to expect that the great achievements in science and technology could generously be utilized to assure the common survival of humanity  protection of the environment and the unfettered enjoyment of larger freedoms by every individual on this planet Earth. After all  the founding fathers themselves made a solemn pledge in the Charter ""to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war  which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind"". Their vision of a peaceful and harmonious world and peoples' hopes for social advancement and economic prosperity have had a common source: total revulsion against war  destruction and darkness. Forty-seven years later  reflecting on the intervening years  we note that the world has witnessed more  not fewer  incidents of just and unjust wars  regional conflicts  racial and ethnic strife  acute forms of human suffering  environmental degradation and an unmitigated endangerment of life itself. Namibia joined other member States of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at its Summit in Jakarta in stating that ""the world today is far from being a peaceful  just and secure place. Simmering disputes  violent conflicts  aggression and foreign occupation  interference in the internal affairs of States  policies of hegemony and domination  ethnic strife  religious intolerance  new forms of racism and narrowly conceived nationalism are major and dangerous obstacles to harmonious coexistence among States and peoples and have even led to the disintegration of States and societies."" Nuclear conflagration  thank heavens  has not occurred  but the world is far from being a peaceful and secure place. History does indeed repeat itself  at least some of the time  if not most of the time. Let me add to this assessment one more observation made in Jakarta by an eminent Asian leader. His view  which is consistent with our own  was: ""We must also ensure that the new world order to which the leaders of the industrialised countries often refer does not turn out to be but a new version of the same old patterns of domination of the strong over the weak and the rich over the poor."" For the new world order to be universally acceptable  it should be genuine in its import and distinct from the old unjust and undemocratic order  and it should show a way forward towards greater human solidarity and cooperation. At this very moment  in South Africa  Somalia  Liberia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Cambodia and various parts of the former Soviet Union and elsewhere in the world millions of victims languish in perpetual tragedy. This carnage includes innocent and defenceless men  women and children who are killed by guns or hunger. The current state of world affairs hardly encourages confidence and optimism about our common future. One need not be a cynic to hold this view. My delegation is delighted to see our illustrious Secretary-General occupying a lofty place in the United Nations Organization at this critical time of a changing global environment. It was Africa's pride and Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali's own crowning personal achievement when he was unanimously elected last year as the first African Secretary-General of our Organization. We commend him for his courage and initiative and for the manner in which he has so ably carried out his daunting tasks. Namibia welcomes the Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace"". Many of the ideas and recommendations contained in it coincide with those emanating from bodies such as the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Commonwealth and others  notably the Nordic States  which some time ago circulated their views on the United Nations reform process. With this in mind  Namibia is alive to a suggestion made from this rostrum  and endorsed by other delegations  that a special meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider the Secretary-General's proposals. If and when this suggestion is carried out and the proposed meeting takes place  we expect the Secretary-General and the members of the Security Council to take into consideration the contributions I have mentioned and to ensure that the intended consultations are inclusive and transparent. There ought to be a careful balance between the need for a renewed commitment to strengthen mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security  on the one hand  and a focus on the burning issues of poverty and other forms of socio-economic injustice  on the other. In this context  I should like to refer to a bold initiative taken by the Secretary-General of the OAU  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim. I have in mind his proposed creation of an institutional mechanism  within the OAU General Secretariat  to deal promptly and effectively with conflict management  prevention and resolution in respect of the eruption of major crises  similar to those now prevailing in Somalia and Liberia  in any African State.  There is also a companion set of proposals in a package entitled ""The Kampala Document""  which is the product of a meeting held last year in Kampala  Uganda  devoted to guestions of security  stability  development and co-operation in Africa. These proposals  in our view  are serious and practical innovations by Africans themselves to confront major political and security crises as and when they occur in any part of Africa  and we wholeheartedly endorse them.  The United Nations Charter itself devotes its chapter VIII to regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with issues such as peace  security and conflict  and encourages appropriate action which is consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The current Secretary-General himself lamented the fact that the ""cold war had impaired the proper activation of this key provision of the Charter and also the fact that""  to paraphrase him  rather than helping to resolve regional conflicts super-Powers actually managed to exacerbate them for their own selfish ends. Quite clearly  there is a linkage between the priority agendas of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity  and this is  as a matter of fact  in keeping with the long-standing co-operation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. Mr. President  at this juncture I should like to address a few words to you personally. May I begin by stating that your own unanimous election and the critical role required of your office become not only propitious on the time-scale of the global agenda  as evidenced by the items for discussion during the current session of the Assembly  but equally by affording an ideal opportunity to you boldly and unambiguously to articulate the concerns and aspirations of the poor and developing Members of this Organization. It gives me great pleasure  therefore  on behalf of the Government and people of Namibia  to extend congratulations to you upon your brilliant election. I have no doubt in my mind that  given your diplomatic skills and vast practical experience  our deliberations will be crowned with success. Our two friendly countries enjoy excellent relations  and I extend best wishes to you. To your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Shamir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  I say many congratulations for a job well done  and I should like to wish him great success and happiness in his future endeavours. The long cherished ideal of the universality of our Organization has been further enhanced as more and more new nations have joined its membership. As this world becomes unavoidably interdependent and we collectively realize that the world is truly a global village  increasingly high expectations are now being placed in the United Nations. This is yet another reason why the Organization needs to be further revitalized and genuinely democratized. The world's contemporary challenges stemming from rapidly changing inter-State relations and social problems cannot be adequately dealt with by the United Nations without fundamental institutional and procedural reforms  including the revision of its Charter. It is in this context that Namibia welcomes all the new Members and wishes them well  while assuring them of our desire to promote close co-operation with all of them in a spirit of friendship and peaceful coexistence. The Rio Earth Summit made the matter abundantly clear: that global economic development and environmental protection go hand in hand. Development must be based on the sustainable utilization of the environment for the sake of this and all future generations. Namibia's Constitution contains a special provision on this crucial subject. It states: ""The State shall actively promote and maintain the welfare of the people by adopting  inter alia  policies aimed at ... the maintenance of ecosystems  essential ecological processes and biological diversity of Namibia and utilization of living natural resources on a sustainable basis for the benefit of all Namibians  both present and future; in particular  the Government shall provide measures against the dumping or recycling of foreign nuclear and toxic waste on Namibian territory.""  Moreover  it further charges the Ombudsman with the duty ""to investigate complaints concerning the over-utilization of living natural resources  the irrational exploitation of non-renewable resources  the degradation and destruction of ecosystems and failure to protect the beauty and character of Namibia."" Towards implementing environment-friendly policies which aim at sustainable development  the Government had  prior to the Rio Earth Summit  adopted a ""Green Plan"" for Namibia that outlines a comprehensive framework for development in accordance with sustainable environmental principles. The Plan elaborates on the Government's approach to our ecological challenges and the conscientious management of our natural resources and national assets. During the days of apartheid colonialism and foreign exploitation  both renewable and non-renewable resources that provided the very basis of the economy were subjected to ruthless plunder mainly for the benefit of foreigners. The Government has taken steps to put an end to this disastrous situation. Many in the developing world  Namibia foremost among them  depend on these resources for daily subsistence  and unless there are going to be alternatives for dealing with debilitating problems such as the debt burden  the foreign exchange dilemma and technological backwardness  many of us are  sad to say  bound to remain in a perpetual state of poverty and underdevelopment. This would in turn mean further degrading the environment and endangering our very existence. It follows that what is required now is an undertaking to speed up implementation of Agenda 21  adopted in Rio. Its financing  it must be stressed  is not only to assist the developing countries to fight poverty and create jobs but equally to protect the ecosystem itself  which is very vital for the survival of humankind.  In the same vein  let me add that Namibia  being a dry  semi-desert country  endorses the proposed convention on combating desertification and urges that the preparation of the international convention on desertification be undertaken during the current session. This brings me to the next topic  namely the current drought and acute situation of hunger and suffering which has afflicted the whole of the southern African subregion. Crop production  livestock farming and our efforts to become food-sufficient and to achieve security have suffered severely. The Government established a National Committee on Drought to ensure  inter alia  better coordination and more efficient delivery of water and food to the most needy sections of the population and the sustenance of the livestock and game. An initial amount of 120 million rand was budgeted for these vital schemes. Furthermore  in addition to these national efforts  we have also made a special appeal to the international community and  generally speaking  the response has been prompt and helpful  for which Namibia is exceedingly grateful. A regional effort is under way which involves both the sharing of data and the coordinating of programmes and communication and transport facilities  coupled with the assistance received from the United Nations system  intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals around the world. In this connection  I should like to express a special word of commendation and appreciation to Sir Ketumile Masire  President of the Republic of Botswana  and to the secretariat of Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) for having taken timely and decisive steps with a view to sensitizing and mobilizing the international community as to the plight of all our peoples in the subregion and for co-sponsoring an important conference on the situation in Geneva early this year. Of course  we all remain hopeful that there will be early and abundant rains this year  and in all subsequent years  as this will  no doubt  mean saving lives. I thought I should also add here a point which  with each passing day  is becoming more and more clear to all Namibians. This has to do with finding  preserving  planning and distributing water resources  as being perhaps the single most precious primary commodity needed to keep us going and sustain life itself. The realization that the world is a global village and one market-place with interlocking financial institutions and credit arrangements underlines the internationalization of the world economy. Namibia  being one of the poorest countries in the South  must continue to raise its voice  in unison with other members of the non-aligned movement and the rest of the developing countries  in favour of the creation of a new and just international economic order. The call for global economic restructuring and reform is a legitimate demand  which should find its place among the top priorities on the agenda of this and other international forums. The ending of the cold war  as it is alleged  and the emergence of a so-called new world order  characterized in part by the rapprochement of the nuclear Powers  have engendered a peculiar  new culture of economic blackmail and sabotage. Powerful and rich countries have lately tended to tamper with the sovereignty of weaker and poorer nations by using the power of the purse and by laying down some stringent conditions. This is being done supposedly to promote democracy  transparency in governance and public accountability a situation which leads to unilateral and often punitive actions just to prove a point. To us  it unfortunately constitutes an arbitrary and precipitous exercise of power and judgement. As Mwalimu Julius Nyerere  the former Chairman of the South Commission  put it recently on another occasion: ""these events have had two very important consequences for the South  and all the countries of it. First  they increase the urgency of developing countries building national self-reliance and increasing their economic co-operation in all fields. Secondly  the triumphant West now believes that its success in the cold war gives it the right as well as the untrammeled power aggressively to promote its economic and political philosophy throughout the South. ""Directly  and through international finance and trade institutions controlled by the wealthy States  and sometimes by embargoes or even political intervention  the North is therefore forcing developing countries of the South to conform to the patterns it designs. ""At the same time protectionism of different kinds is increasing in the North  and our separate weakness is being used to ride roughshod over our opinions in international negotiations as well as in bilateral South-North discussions."" How can one disagree with this poignant observation? The non-aligned Movement which represents the majority of humankind is an ideal forum for the developing countries within which to plan and act together on issues  including the important issues which preoccupy the United Nations. Allow me  once again  to cite Mwalimu's wise and telling words when he asserted thus: ""We need a Movement of the South to speak for the rights of the countries of the South. At present what we have is the Non-Aligned Movement  and for United Nations negotiating purposes the Group of 77. Why then is there this talk of the Non-Aligned Movement no longer being needed?"" This  I believe  remains the inescapable reality  whether the world was or is bipolar or unipolar. On the situation in South Africa  Namibia expresses support for and solidarity with the liberation movements and all the democratic forces inside that violence-torn neighbouring country. That is why we felt gratified  and participated in the debate  when the issue of the raging violence in South Africa was brought to the Security Council last July. Our emphasis in our statement was that  now that the United Nations had become engaged in the situation  its presence should be prolonged and the size of its team increased in order to monitor the violence and assist in the transition to a democratic  non-racial and united South Africa. For now  the situation remains explosive and dangerous and  therefore  warrants the continuation of international pressure on the South African Government. In the meantime  we call upon Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party to rejoin Comrade Nelson Mandela  President de Klerk and his other compatriots in the negotiations  with the establishment and consolidation of peace as the first prerequisite  and the adoption of a democratic constitution as the next step in the transition. For the first time in their history  our Angolan neighbours went to the polls on 29 and 30 September  in multiparty elections  to choose a party and candidates who must now install a new Government. It has not been easy  but the sheer will and determination of the voters and monitors alike have confounded many a cynic who believed that it would be impossible to hold free and fair elections in Angola. Namibia sees this is a great victory for the Angolan people -and congratulates them. It also congratulates the leaders of all the political parties on believing in their people's political maturity and accepting the final verdict of the ballot-box. Namibia once again gives its assurance that it will continue to work closely with the Government of the  day in that sisterly and friendly country  on the basis of friendship and for the benefit of both countries. The Government of President Chissano and RENAMO finally sat down together in Rome and signed a ceasefire agreement to end the fighting in Mozambique and rebuild the country. We congratulate both President Joaquim Chissano and Mr. Afonso Dhlakama on demonstrating political will and for giving the Mozambican people hope and confidence in their future. They deserve our full and hearty congratulations on this momentous achievement  and we wish them further success as they work for the adoption of a new constitution and for the restoration of peace and order in their country. Many helpers and interlocutors made this achievement possible. They include the Italian hosts and  in particular  the United Nations. But I should like to commend Presidents Mugabe and Masire for their mediation efforts  which have paid off  to the great happiness of all Africans and their well-wishers around the world. There was one more key player: Mr. Pik Botha  the South African Foreign Minister  who was very active during the final  delicate hours  thereby securing the signing of the cease-fire agreement. Namibia is also pleased to acknowledge his contribution. As regards the situation in Somalia  Namibia supports the request of President Abdou Diouf of the Republic of Senegal  current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  that an international conference on the human disaster in that African country be convened as a matter of the utmost urgency. As the United Nations Secretary-General himself has put it  ""when it comes to death and misery  no one situation takes priority over another."" (A/47/1  para. 116) On the situation in Western Sahara  Namibi supports the principle of self-determination for the Saharan people. To this end  we endorse the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Representative to remove all the obstacles and help resolve disputes about the criteria for eligibility to vote in the referendum  and thus to advance the process. Likewise  Namibia has always held the view that the political aspirations  and in particular the right to self-determination  of the Palestinian people  led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  are at the core of the conflict in the Middle East. Here we include the establishment of an independent Palestinian State  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The season of peace and dialogue has arrived. In the present circumstances  that is the only viable and sensible game in town. If a face-to-face meeting between the President of Syria and the Prime Minister of Israel will give further impetus to the Middle East peace process and pave the way towards a just  comprehensive and lasting settlement  Namibia will strongly encourage such a historic undertaking within the framework of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Iran and the United Arab Emirates two sisterly and friendly neighbours - ought not to allow the present misunderstandings to be magnified beyond the confines of their bilateral relations. Rather  they should resolve those misunderstandings through dialogue and by peaceful means. Happily  Kuwait is going ahead with the consolidation of peace and the reconstruction of the country. Namibia expresses its unswerving solidarity with its Kuwaiti friends  and extends best wishes to them. The carnage in Bosnia and Herzegovina is but the latest instance of man's inhumanity to man. Whether it takes place under the banner of the notorious ""ethnic cleansing"" or as religious retribution  this ugly tragedy cannot be allowed to continue. In and around the Korean peninsula  we see steady movement by all the parties concerned in favour of dialogue  while de-emphasizing confrontation and military solutions. This is indeed good news for world peace and security. The reunification of Korea is no longer an unthinkable goal  as the North and the South of that divided nation earnestly continue to regularise high-level meetings and to encourage families to interact freely.  We urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea  with both of which Namibia maintains excellent diplomatic and cooperative relations  to remain engaged in those critical discussions until an amicable and peaceful solution is found. Peace and reconciliation in Cambodia are yet to be realized. Inspired by the success of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia  we hope and pray that the ongoing United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) operation in that troubled country  too  will be crowned with huge success. In concluding my statement  I would be remiss if I did not give an update to the General Assembly and the Secretary-General on the outstanding dispute between Namibia and South Africa on Walvis Bay and the offshore islands. As the matter stands now  a joint transitional administration of a limited duration will be established over these territories on 1 November 1992. It will be known as the Joint Administrative Authority and headed by two Chief Executives  one Namibian and one South African. In the meantime  the two Governments will keep the negotiations going on the core issue of re-integration  in accordance with Security Council resolution 432 (1978). Finally  may I also inform the Assembly that Namibia became the one hundred and fifth member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on 15 September 1992 and also acceded to the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and deposited the instruments to this effect with the designated authorities.

This election is testimony to the high esteem and prestige enjoyed by his country  Bulgaria  on the international scene and its contribution to the achievement of the ideals of our Organization  and is an acknowledgment of his talents as a seasoned diplomat and man of experience.He should like to include in these congratulations the other members of the Bureau and to assure them of the full and total cooperation of the delegation of Niger in accomplishing their task.I should like to express to Mr. Ganev's predecessor.Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  our great satisfaction and compliments on his excellent guidance of the work of the forty-sixth session.We hail and welcome the countries that have just joined the great family of the United Nations  whose admission is in keeping with the universality of our Organization.I should also like to express once again to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  the heartfelt congratulations of His Excellency Mr. Cheiffou Amadou  Prime Minister and Head of Government of the Republic of Niger  on his election  which is the crowning of a brilliant career. The Government of Niger also wishes to extend to him its encouragement and support for the dynamism he has already imparted to the Organization.Niger rejoices at the end of East-West rivalries and at the climate of confidence that has thus been created. It is a decisive turning-point in the history of mankind  marked by profound and rapid political and social changes brought about by powerful currents towards freedom  justice  democracy and human rights. This positive development in international relations  and particularly the hopes and expectations to which it has given rise  makes it imperative for us to engage in the search for a new world balance that takes into consideration the aspirations and needs all of the components of international society. In this connection  the sessions of the General Assembly are for the international community opportunities to achieve further progress in the search for peace  justice and harmony among peoples  in keeping with the ideals and principles of the Charter.Thanks to the climate of international detente  prospects of general and complete disarmament and the hope that that will release additional resources for development seem increasingly achievable. Niger notes with satisfaction the positive results already on record in this field and wishes to congratulate the Secretary-General on his efforts towards general and complete disarmament.International peace and security require that all countries make greater efforts towards a reduction of all armed forces and all deadly weapons of destruction. In this regard  I should like to announce that Niger has just ratified the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.The climate of international detente is felt also in the evolution of regional conflicts. The ""Agenda for Peace""  which is a compendium of extremely relevant recommendations and measures for the prevention of conflict  peace-keeping and peacemaking  is an invaluable contribution of the Secretary-General to current thinking on ways of safeguarding international peace.Niger hopes for a speedy and equitable solution to the conflict inWestern Sahara through the organization of a self-determination referendum. The Government of Niger expresses the hope that the recommendations of the meetings of Lome  Bamako and Yamoussokro and the most recent summit in Dakar of the Economic Community of West African States be taken into account by all parties to the conflict in Liberia  with a view to the establishment of peace and national reconciliation. The situation in Somalia is tragic and repugnant. He witness daily the appalling suffering of an entire people  victim of the most tragic drought exacerbated by a fratricidal war that makes the provision of humanitarian assistance difficult. Niger joins the rest of the international community in urging the rival factions to cease their hostilities and accept the presence of United Nations observers and a United Nations peace-keeping force to ensure respect for the cease-fire agreement and to ensure the distribution of food aid.Recent developments in South Africa give us hope. Niger believes that the international community must continue to encourage the South African regime to take further measures to accelerate the democratization process while at the same time maintaining the necessary pressure until a democratic  non-racial Government is formed. The Organization must make the Pretoria regime adopt urgent measures to put an end to the organized violence that is tearing apart the country's black community and that constitutes a serious obstacle to the resumption and proper conduct of negotiations in the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa.With respect to security  the Middle East remains the most sensitive region in the world. Niger believes that no just and lasting peace can be established in the Middle East unless Israel withdraws completely from occupied Palestinian and Arab territories  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif. We encourage all efforts to that end  and we welcome the dialog that has begun since the Madrid conference  as well as the current peace negotiations on a just and final settlement of the Middle East conflict. With respect to the Arabian-Persian Gulf/ Niger strongly condemned the aggression against and occupation of Kuwait. Kuwait has been liberated  but the threat of war persists. Respect for Security Council resolutions and the delimitation of the boundaries between Iraq and Kuwait are indispensable if a lasting peace is to return to the region.The tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inadmissible in the twentieth century. Niger vigorously condemns the acts of barbarism committed by forces of Serbia and of Montenegro against the populations of Bosnia and Herzegovina in violation of the sovereignty  independence and integrity of that country. Niger fully supports Security Council resolutions 770 (1992) and 771 (1992). as well as the resolutions of other international bodies condemning the aggression and calling for cooperation by all States in helping Bosnia and Herzegovina.The guest for peace in the world is one of the Organization's loftiest objectives. But to be complete  world peace must be backed by action to eliminate poverty. At the 1990 Paris Conference of least developed countries  the world was not surprised to learn that the number of least developed countries had grown from 28 to 42  most of them African.The ever-growing burden of debt and debt servicing continues to deprive developing countries of resources they need for their development. Reasons for the grave crisis in Africa include the constant drop in commodity prices  the rise in prices for manufactured goods  the lack of access to developed-country markets  and the decline in development assistance. The continuing deterioration in Africa's economic situation is condemning hundreds of millions of individuals to stagnation and permanent poverty.In 1986/ the United Nations  which we invoke each year  adopted the United Nations program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. It was then the consensus view that the economic crisis in Africa was essentially structural. African countries had committed themselves to adopt structural-adjustment policies  and developed countries and financial institutions had committed themselves to provide assistance and financial flows.Unfortunately  despite the policies and reforms undertaken by African countries and the recommendations made at all international conferences  the situation continues to deteriorate. Despite the social cost of the reforms and sacrifices of African countries  the results have been disappointing  because of a lack of follow-up measures.But there is growing awareness of the need to tackle this extremely serious situation more resolutely. Measures to lighten the debt burden of the poorest countries should be viewed in that context. The same is true of the proposal made by the former Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  on development financing  which was considered at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly.We welcome the decision of the Japanese Government to organize a 1993 international conference on development in Africa with the participation of African Heads of State.We wish finally to mention the move to reinvigorate international cooperation stemming largely from the revitalization and restructuring of United Nations activities in the economic and social fields. Those activities should be strictly based on the recommendations adopted by the most recent international conferences. These include:	the	Declaration	adopted at theeighteenth special session of the General Assembly on international economic cooperation; the International Development Strategy for the fourth United Nations Development Decade; the program of Action adopted at the World Summit for Children; and the program of Action and other major decisions adopted at the Earth Summit the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro.The right to development presupposes the right to a healthy environment. The Earth Summit at Rio defined the links between environment and development. It defined the responsibilities of the North and of the South for the deterioration of our ecosystem. It also made it possible to adopt legal instruments designed to reconcile man and nature. I speak here of the Earth Charter and of the conventions on biodiversity and on climatic change.As a Sahelian country. Niger must deal with the effects of repeated drought and increasing desertification. It is of particular interest to us that at this session the Assembly should define the modalities for the negotiation and adoption of an international convention on drought and desertification.Turning to the social sphere  we encourage United Nations efforts to promote the struggle against acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  illegal trafficking in narcotics  and drug abuse. Those scourges must remain at the center of our concerns. That is true too of efforts at the integration of women into the development process and of measures to protect the disabled  children and other vulnerable groups. The international conference on human rights in 1993  the conference on population and development in 1994  the world summit on social development and the fourth world conference on women  both in 1995  will offer opportunities to review all these problems at the highest level.Natural disasters and other calamities are on the increase  and we must continue to focus on them. Each time  the devastating consequences of these phenomena remind us of the urgent need to enhance the ability of the United Nations to act more effectively. He are pleased at the Organization's examination of these subjects and at the appointment of distinguished individuals to deal with these issues.Today  developing countries are fully aware of their primary responsibility for development. The political renewal we have seen in many African countries  including my own  stems from that awareness. Indeed  as members know  Niger convened  from 29 July to 3 November 1991  a conference on national sovereignty at which we engaged in a stark assessment of 30 years of efforts and to identify courses of action  guidelines and decisions to be implemented over a transitional period of 15 months.Since then  the democratically elected transition organs have knuckled down to implementing the political  economic  social  and cultural measures adopted by the Conference. These mainly involve improving and re-balancing the economic and financial situation; undertaking institutional reforms in every field; establishing self-confidence; and consolidating national solidarity and unity. Such measures  the outcome of a national consensus  are based on the fundamental choice by the people of Niger of a democratic and republican course.Following its National Conference  Niger embarked resolutely on the road towards a pluralistic democracy with respect for human rights and guarantees of the effective exercise of public freedoms. The process initiated 11 months ago is following its charted course  gaining strength and further entrenching itself every day. There are difficulties inherent in the nature of the undertaking  but there are also results that encourage us to persevere.While perhaps modest  this experience of a young democracy has made it possible to assess the constraints imposed by such a social project  the risks of derailment it entails  the impatience that must be stifled  and the legitimate expectations that must be met in order to ensure that this lofty enterprise succeeds. The establishment of stable institutions designed to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms  social justice and national unity through regular and transparent elections will be crowned  we are sure  with success by the establishment of a state of law and a true democracy.I am pleased to announce that Niger is making progress in the electoral consultations for the adoption of a constitution and the holding of municipal  legislative and presidential elections. Thus  on the threshold of the year 1993  Niger will become democratic on a firm footing.He are aware  however  that no democratization policy can be considered as lasting if measures are not taken to foster conditions favorable to progress and the flourishing of humanity. That is why we turn with hope to the international community  and more specifically to the United Nations  to nurture a new spirit of solidarity and justice among nations. Niger cherishes the hope that the General Assembly at this session will contribute to the solution of the great challenges facing the international community."
"116",5101,"NGA",47,1992,"On behalf of the Nigerian delegation  Icongratulate you. Sir  on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election is testimony to your sterling qualities as a statesman and a diplomat.I wish also to pay tribute to your distinguished predecessor.His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for the outstanding manner in which he steered the affairs of the General Assembly during its forty-sixth session.I wish to express on behalf of President Babangida  the Government and the people of Nigeria our appreciation to the many delegations which sent us messages of condolence following the loss of lives resulting from the tragic plane crash near Lagos.I should also like to take this opportunity to commend Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali for the admirable manner in which he has been performing his duties as Secretary-General of the United Nations. I am confident that Mr. Boutros-Ghali  an accomplished diplomat  a distinguished statesman and a scholar of repute  will remain true to the worthy ideals of our Organization and bring his versatile experience to bear on the crucial issues confronting the international community.Nigeria welcomes the new Members of our Organization. Their participation will enrich our discussions and strengthen international legitimacy and the rule of law.I should also like to take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that in January 1993 Nigeria will complete its transition to democracy with the handing over of power to an elected Government. As you are aware  elected governments at the local and state levels are already in place. Elections to  the Senate and the House of Representatives have also been concluded. Our untiring efforts to evolving a democratic arrangement suited to our environment reflect our commitment to pluralism and dialog.In no other period in this century has there been greater hope for global peace and security than now. The end of the cold war  the noteworthy efforts in the field of nuclear disarmament and the ever-widening circle of democracy all promise to create an international environment that is more conducive to the attainment of international peace and security.However  many problems still threaten our quest for global peace  cooperation and development. In some parts of the world  political conflicts have degenerated into violence. We are also witnessing the resurgence of long-dormant ethnic and boundary disputes in Europe. Indeed  no region of the world today is spared the scourge of war. These wars have drained states and the international community of resources that could have been used for development. Africa  in particular  has experienced severe and persistent strife  especially in Sudan  Western Sahara  Somalia  Liberia and Rwanda. These conflicts have caused untold hardship  economic dislocation and a massive refugee burden. In addition  the conflicts have worsened Africa's weak economic condition and made more distant our hope for growth and development.In accordance with its obligations under the Charters of the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations  Africa has continued to make efforts to settle these conflicts. Nigeria  for instance  hosted a peace conference on Sudan in May 1992 and also undertook a mission to Somalia to urge the various factions to resolve their differences peacefully. In Liberia/ we continue to work through the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in search of peace. We remain  as ever  committed to the restoration of lasting peace in that country. The ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) is an admirable example of regional arrangements recommended under Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. It should not be allowed to fail. We appeal to all the parties in Liberia to cooperate with ECOWAS in implementing the agreements reached so far. The international community  particularly the United Nations  should complement our regional peace-keeping and peacemaking efforts through greater involvement and increased humanitarian assistance.The situation in Western Sahara continues to be a source of great concern. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to revive the stalled peace process. Nigeria believes strongly that the joint peace plan of the United Nations and the Organization for African Unity provides the best framework for ensuring peace while safeguarding the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.In response to pressures from the international community  change is indeed taking place in South Africa  and we welcome it. However  the difficulties in maintaining the momentum of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) talks give serious cause for concern. We urge the South African Government to intensify efforts to ensure an environment conducive to completing the transition to a non-racial democratic South Africa. The threatto CODESA by anti-democratic forces must not be allowed to succeed.But more importantly  and as a measure of its commitment to democratic rule  the South African Government should agree to the immediate establishment of an interim government of national unity that will supervise the transition to a democratic order. The role of the United Nations remains crucial in this process. That is why we welcome the dispatch of United Nations observers to South Africa. He call on the Organization to increase the number of observers to enable them to oversee the transition more effectively.The Nigerian Government applauds the recent efforts to advance the peace process in the Middle East. The present international climate is conducive to negotiation and compromise. He urge all parties to the Middle East conflict to take advantage of this momentous period in history to find a just and lasting solution to all aspects of the conflict. Such a lasting peace can be built only on a foundation that assures justice for all and the peaceful coexistence of all States in the Middle East  in accordance with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).For the past few months the people of what was formerly Yugoslavia have not known peace. The parties to the conflict should heed the appeal of the international community by respecting cease-fire agreements and by resolving their differences through negotiations. They owe their people and us all the sacred duty of achieving peace.There cannot be security in our world so long as nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction exist. As the United Nations begins discussion on extending the non-proliferation Treaty  all nations should place at the fore of that debate the objective of achieving a comprehensive nuclear-test ban.The chemical weapons Convention  which was recently concluded  represents asignificant milestone in the history of disarmament. Nigeria will sign the Convention and urges all States to do the same.As the Assembly is aware. Member States spend over $1 trillion annually on armaments. This huge expenditure is no longer necessary as States move to an era of cooperation and peace. Expenditure on armaments should be sharply reduced in order to divert resources from this sector to development programs world wide.The economies of African States continue to be depressed by the debt burden  unfavorable commodity prices  net outflow of resources and protectionist trade policies. There is need for new funds to be injected into Africa to reverse the continent's economic decline. He acknowledge that our economic recovery and development depends primarily on the policies pursued by African Governments. However  the success of such policies rests in part on the fairness of the international economic system and the transfer to African States of adequate resources to enhance our growth-oriented policies.The Rio Summit in our view was a success. The effective implementation of Agenda 21 programs depends on the provision of financial resources to match the commitments. While we appreciate the support of the international community on the questions of desertification and drought  which are causing extensive environmental degradation in Africa  we appeal to all Member States fully to support the setting up of an intergovernmental negotiating committee to prepare an international convention on desertification. We also expect that the composition of a commission on sustainable development will be finalized at this session of the General Assembly.At its summit meeting in January this year  the Security Council reoriented itself to pursue the objective of preventive diplomacy  of peacemaking and peace-keeping within the ambit of its responsibility. The Secretary-General has now produced a report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" with far-reaching implications for our Organization. My delegation notes with appreciation the recommendations contained in that report  especially with respect to the role of regional and subregional arrangements in promoting international peace.Almost half a century ago the United Nations had 51 Members. The Membership has now grown to 179. The Security Council  which is vested with the primary responsibility of dealing with issues of international peace and security  has maintained its permanent membership of five. In his address to the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session  the President of Nigeria  then in his capacity as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity  said: ""The limitation of the permanent membership to the present five has become both anachronistic and unrepresentative.The composition of the permanent membership of the Security Council represents three out of five regions. Seen in the North-South context  four of its members come from the North. In addition  new demands on the issue have emerged with the recent changes in the international system. The parameters of democracy as well as size and role within the global system have become relevant criteria for adjudging the issue of representation.The need to increase the number of permanent seats in the Security Council is in our view an idea whose time has come. Therefore  it should be a matter of principle for the international community that Africa must not continue to be a region without representation in the permanent membership of the Security Council. Nigeria  the most populous African nation  with the largest economic potential and its proven commitment to the cause of worldpeace and security  possesses the qualifications to fulfill Africa's aspirations in this regard.Let me seize this opportunity to place on record our appreciation for the courage of the Secretary-General in drawing the attention of the international community to the situation in Somalia. Since then events have shown that that courage was not misplaced. In the same vein  we expect that the Secretary-General will ensure that Africans are adequately represented in the upper echelons of the United Nations Secretariat.As we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Organization  let us rededicate ourselves to the ideals enshrined in the Charter. The gains manifested in the political and security fields in recent times must be matched by corresponding gains in the economic and social fields. For this to materialize  we must strengthen international cooperation in tackling the economic and social challenges facing our world. My delegation looks forward to the crystallization of such cooperation. He must therefore resolve to eradicate poverty  ignorance and disease; promote and protect human rights in all their facets; prevent the degradation of the environment; eliminate war as an instrument of State policy; and  above all  promote a virile  efficient and democratic United Nations. "
"117",5146,"NIC",47,1992,"Allow me to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. I am also pleased to welcome the new countries that have joined the United Nations and to pledge to them the friendship and cooperation of Nicaragua. Nearly 50 years since the San Francisco Charter was signed there exists a new world order similar in importance to  but very different from  that which gave birth to the United Nations Charter. The walls of intolerance are crumbling and the pillars of apartheid are beginning to give way. New democracies have arisen on the ruins of dictatorships. The era of confrontation between the super-Powers has come to an end  and most of the nations of the world are now working for peace. We are building a new world order in which equity  solidarity and the rule of international law must be promoted. This transition towards a new world order  although positive  is not without danger. Major contradictions have arisen. The expectation that the improvement of relations between East and West would yield a ""peace dividend"" has not yet been realized. There is an urgent need to forge a consensus on a world-wide commitment to strengthen international cooperation and reactivate economic growth and development. The efforts of the overwhelming majority of the Members of the Organization to promote growth and development continue to be hindered by restricted access to new markets  scarce financial resources  lack of foreign investment  the debt burden  limitations on the transfer of technology and the ongoing inequality in the financial systems and international trade. The coffee situation  brought about by an abrupt decline in prices  deserves renewed efforts in the negotiations for a new Agreement in the International Coffee Organization. As regards bananas  we would like to see a free market  without protectionist barriers  that takes duly into account the economic and commercial realities of the Latin American countries. An alarming number of people are still suffering the tragic consequences of armed conflict  and poverty continues to stifle hopes for a better future. Millions of children do not have access to health care or education. Millions of women  who constitute the majority of the world's population  remain oppressed. Our Organization can become a more important mechanism for promoting economic and social development by implementing the primary strategies that have been worked out and agreed upon by its members. The restructuring of the United Nations in the economic and social fields is of particular importance to Nicaragua. We want the purposes that have been set forth to become realities. We support the actions of the Secretary-General to bring about improved coordination of the various components of the system by establishing a presence in countries based on an integrated and unified approach. We also support the reforms within the Secretariat itself and the functioning of the new Department of Economic and Social Development. Nicaragua also supports the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council. The yearning of peoples for freedom  justice and respect for the dignity and worth of the individual is stronger than evil or tyranny. Nothing can prevent peoples from freeing themselves from political oppression or the culture of violence. Two years ago I referred here to the main challenges that my Government had set for itself in bringing peace to my country  building democracy and fighting inflation. Today I can say that we have succeeded. In the elections of 25 February 1990 Nicaraguans established a patriotic alliance based on peace  reconciliation  freedom  progress and justice. As an important initial step in the building of a democratic and free society  we brought peace to the country after many years of civil war. Once the 24 000 men of the Nicaraguan resistance had been disarmed we began the general plan for reducing the size of the army. When I came to the General Assembly in 1990 I said that we had reduced the army from 96 000 men to 34 000. Today our army is made up of only 17 000 men.  I feel that the dream of a Central America where the sound of hands at work for ever takes the place of the sound of gunfire is coming closer. We have established disarmament brigades throughout the country and are promoting the national plan to collect  in stages  weapons in civilian hands. This effort has produced highly satisfactory results  and the people of Nicaragua themselves have witnessed the destruction and burial of nearly 50 000 weapons of war  which has reduced the probability of armed conflicts and confrontations. In 1991  thanks to the effort made by our people  we laid the foundations for economic recovery in Nicaragua by putting an end to hyperinflation  which had reached nearly 55 000 per cent; today  the inflation rate is down to zero. We have begun the transition from totalitarianism to civilian democracy  from a centralized economy to a social  market economy. We have guaranteed freedom of expression  there are many more communications media  and there is complete freedom of thought and religion. We have also strengthened the freedom of association. There is clear separation of the powers of the State  and we have the first legislative assembly in Nicaragua's history; 16 political parties are represented in the assembly following the first free elections since our independence 171 years ago. I should also like to emphasize the fact that  as a result of our striving to come closer together  we have been able to develop  with great success  the economic stabilization and adjustment programme. The budget has been balanced  military expenditure have been drastically cut  wages have been stabilized  privatization is moving forward with the support and participation of the workers  and new banks and private financial institutions have begun to operate in my country.  Thanks to the progress made in our economic programme  and with support from the provisions made by this Assembly in 1990 and 1992  it has been possible to ensure special treatment from the international community. We have had 75 per cent of our debt to the Paris Club forgiven  and new international credits are being made available to Nicaragua. Now we must take the next step: to reactivate the economy of the country and promote development within the framework of increasingly strengthening public order and the State of Law  which  together with attention to social problems  is at the focus of our immediate aims. We have come to this forum to speak of the urgent need for special and total cooperation from the United Nations system in the social and economic reconstruction of Nicaragua. Once peace and economic stability reign we must tackle the aftermath of the war and the root causes of that war  the problems of unemployment and also the reincorporation of displaced and repatriated persons into the social and economic life of the country. We ask for the international community's support for this United Nations programme  particularly because our situation has been made worse this year by terrible natural disasters such as the eruption of the Cerro Negro volcano and the recent tsunami. The chances for reinforcing stability and promoting reconciliation and economic grown in our country are better than they were when I began my term in office. For the first time  we are the major players in championing our own freedom and- bringing about our own changes through dedicating ourselves to the task of national reconstruction  the common cause of the Nicaraguan nation. The present democratic process in Nicaragua is in keeping with the legitimate interests and the deeply-held convictions of our people  and is in tune with the spirit of the changes taking place throughout the world. The major achievements of the last two years have been made possible  first  by the determined efforts of the Nicaraguan people  who have summoned the determination to tackle the vicissitudes of history  and secondly  by the support and solidarity of the international community  whose friendly cooperation has supported the Nicaraguan people's own efforts. I wish to avail myself of this world forum to offer profound thanks to the peoples and governments which have helped us  and to the international financial bodies  including the Interamerican Development Bank  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I offer them all the sincere gratitude of the people and Government of Nicaragua. International cooperation is indispensable if Nicaragua is to consolidate and build on the progress that has been made. If assistance to Nicaragua is suspended  or  even worse  if the undertakings made by the international community at the meetings of the consultative group organized by the World Bank are not fulfilled  the land we have been cultivating with so many sacrifices will go back to being barren  fertile ground only for intolerance  confrontation and totalitarianism. We must not allow that to happen. Two years ago  in this very forum  I said that my dream was for a demilitarized Central America. We have therefore worked tirelessly to promote regional negotiations with a view to reducing weapons and troop numbers in Central America to the lowest possible level. I also talked about my dream of a unified Central America. Today  our countries are speaking with one voice and are negotiating free trade agreements with other regional blocs. Our process of integration has taken on strength and vigour in all areas. The ideal of a strong and united Central America is coming ever closer. With every passing day  I see that reality and our dreams can come closer together when there is the will and the determination. I firmly believe that Central America has taken the historic and irrevocable decision to move forward  as a region  along the path of peace  freedom  democracy and development. We in Nicaragua are concerned at how fragile democracy is in the developing countries. Very many of them have chosen the path of democracy; some  like Nicaragua  have made significant progress in the midst of a difficult transition. All of them  though  could benefit even more from resolute international support in favour of democracy. We have the impression that the international community has not yet fully realized what is at stake in some of these countries. Freedom is still extremely fragile there  and economic and social democracy is a distant dream. The case of Haiti is a reflection of the concerns and sufferings of Latin America. Generally speaking  the new democracies lack democratic institutions and traditions; the economic elements that promote change are scarce; violence has not yet fully died out and intolerance and hatred still reign. In the nascent democracies  the new political systems must be bolstered in the midst of high levels of extreme poverty  the legacy of the foreign debt burden  the impact of stringent economic adjustments  the benefits of which will be felt only over the long term. These are serious constraints on efforts to get the economy off the ground and to promote growth  and extra efforts must be made on top of what is normal for developing countries.  With suitable international cooperation that complements internal efforts and respects the sovereignty of our nations  and with the establishment of modern  flexible democratic systems  we will attain the noble objectives we have set for ourselves. With the end of the war and the emergence of peace  we have begun to lay the foundations of a sovereign  non-aligned  independent foreign policy of international reconciliation  which will make it possible for us to establish diplomatic relations with all the nations of the world. Its basic tenets offer an excellent opportunity to develop further our own democratic process and support that of fraternal countries. It is our hope that meaningful commitments can be achieved among the members of the international community during the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993  the Conference on Population and Development in 1994 and at the World Summit for Social Development  which will be held in 1995. The end of the cold war has given the United Nations the best opportunity in its history to play to the full its important role in the international system of collective security. Peace-keeping operations in their various forms and the participation of the Organization in the resolution of conflicts should be strengthened. With the onset of peace in El Salvador this year and the strengthening of our own process in Nicaragua  Central America has ceased to be a zone of armed conflict affecting international security. We welcome the great efforts towards understanding being made in Guatemala and we call on the international community to continue providing its valuable cooperation in the commitments we Central Americans have undertaken with our own peoples. In the Middle East it is urgent that a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the situation of the Palestinian people be found. It is our hope that the talks will continue and that concrete results will be achieved that will contribute to better dialogue and a definitive peace agreement. We condemn the serious situations existing in Somalia  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iraq. In the case of Iraq  we advocate full compliance with the Organization's decisions  with regard to their humanitarian aspects and with the human rights of the civilian population. In connection with the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina  the cessation of hostilities  the provision of humanitarian assistance and free access to the International Committee of the Red Cross and other organizations providing medical and humanitarian assistance are universal demands that should be met immediately. Conditions in Somalia call for stronger action on the part of the Organization. The world's conscience cannot tolerate situations like those we are witnessing there. Nicaragua has offered to take part in any humanitarian-assistance or peace-keeping operation in Somalia  and we are also willing to be a part of any other effort to relieve the tragedy of that beloved people. We are following with interest the situation in South Africa. We hope that soon its sons and daughters  united  will devote themselves to the task of national reconstruction in democracy and freedom. I should also like to mention the situation of a nation of 21 million inhabitants which today has one of the most vigorous economies in the international system. It is time we acknowledged the important efforts made by that nation in the economic  political and social fields. I speak of the Republic of China in Taiwan. In conclusion  I wish to say that Nicaragua has faith in the United Nations. We are sure that its reorganization will make it stronger and will make further effective changes in its operation. Members may be sure that the United Nations community will always have Nicaragua by its side. "
"118",5193,"NLD",47,1992," It is a great pleasure to see you  Sir  a youthful symbol of a profoundly changed Bulgaria  in the Chair. I know and trust that you will steer us skilfully through this session of the General Assembly. The cold war is over. The world has heaved a sigh of relief. The United Nations now has an unprecedented opportunity to carry out the mandate contained in the Charter  even though politically the world has grown much more complex and complicated. Of course  no change has occurred in the underlying problems of a long-term nature. The threat to the very survival of the human race posed by the deterioration of the environment  overpopulation and poverty was there already  even though awareness of the threat has increased quite dramatically in recent years. It is a threat that will be with us for years to come  and it will grow more and more acute if there is a lack of appropriate action. One course of action is for the United Nations to put its house in order in these areas through a restructuring of its economic and social sectors and through a meaningful follow-up to the Rio Summit. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development has put sustainable development high on our agenda  and there it should remain. The establishment of solid machinery  including a high-level commission on sustainable development  will  we hope  be one of the major achievements of this session of the General Assembly. But in the political field  on which I will concentrate today  there has been a qualitative change. We are still thankful for the end of the cold war  with its menace of massive nuclear destruction  but in its stead a plethora of conflicts and potential conflicts has sprung up with a vehemence which nobody had foreseen. Each of these conflicts has its own characteristics  and each has to be dealt with in a particular fashion. The United Nations is  on the whole  the right organization to deal with these emergencies  whether directly or indirectly. In order to carry out that task it will need to possess all the means necessary for what I would call a flexible response  ranging from preventive diplomacy to repressive action. A number of these requirements have been set out by the Secretary-General in his impressive report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). This Agenda will form the basis for our discussions on the subject. Where and when should the United Nations intervene? Clearly  it cannot be everything to everyone. In order not to overstretch  it inevitably has to apply a certain degree of self-restraint. Moreover  the membership of our Organization consists of sovereign States  and respect for their sovereignty is one of its principles. Nevertheless  it would be too easy to make non-intervention and deference to domestic jurisdiction the leading guideline. Moreover  it would not work. Frontiers have become porous and information world-wide. Atrocities and aggression committed within a country cannot pass unnoticed  and once noticed will not be tolerated by world opinion. For the United Nations to stand idly by would be detrimental to its new-found status  which we all have an interest in protecting. With the end of the cold war  regional conflicts have proliferated  but at the same time the possibility of doing something about them has increased. This is both because the Security Council is not paralyzed by vetoes any more and because the risk of a conflict's degenerating into global war has subsided. This makes it possible to contemplate international action where it would have been impossible or unfeasible before. With the possibility of action comes the notion that lack of action is a form of action as well  requiring a decision  just as a decision is necessary to act. A decision not to act in the case of flagrant violations of human rights or the rights of minorities  or in the case of large-scale human suffering  will now set a precedent  just as planned intervention does. It is no longer possible just to look the other way. Perhaps somewhat belatedly  this has been recognized in the case of Somalia. The international community could not afford to condone the intolerable situation in that country any longer. The short-term task consists of assuring the survival of the people. In the somewhat longer term  the whole country will have to be reconstructed. The United Nations has a major role to play on both counts. The United Nations has also become involved in former Yugoslavia. Here we see massive aggression  destruction  impending starvation and even the establishment of concentration camps  all with a view to making large areas ""ethnically clean""  as the ugly saying goes. Nationalism and irredentism have run wild and are threatening neighbouring States as well. Everyone knows who is mainly responsible. Concerted action can and should be taken. Effective delegation and cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations is crucial. Joint United Nations-European Community efforts to help solve the Yugoslav crisis are a clear example. Interaction between the United Nations and the European Community  in their co-chairmanship of the London Conference  has underlined the potential for coordination between the United Nations and regional organizations in the field of preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and peacemaking. It is not only Chapter VIII that is being put into practice here. Even more important is the linkage between the quest for a diplomatic solution on the one hand and the possibility of enforcement action by the United Nations on the other hand  in the event of non-compliance by the parties concerned. The recognition of territorial and ethnical faits accomplis would be an insult to the Charter. To my mind  the Yugoslav crisis is a compelling case for action. More could be done  and I hope that more will be done soon. The Netherlands fully supports the Secretary-General's view that: ""regional arrangements or agencies in many cases possess a potential that should be utilized in serving... preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping  peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building"". (A/47/277  para. 64) Indeed  I am convinced that regional organizations increasingly have to take up responsibilities with regard to regional peace and security. The role of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in the Yugoslav crisis is a clear example of this trend. So are others  such as the Organization of American States and the Organization of African Unity. The process of delegation and cooperation between the United Nations and the various regional organizations does not have to stop at this level. Organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Western European Union have specific operational contributions to make as well. Both organizations recently announced at the CSCE Summit in Helsinki their decision to make resources available to support the CSCE or the United Nations in carrying out peace-keeping activities. The CSCE can also call on others  such as the Commonwealth of Independent States  to contribute to peace-keeping activities. This development is a concrete example of an evolving network of organizations which we refer to as 'interlocking institutions'. The Security Council is rightly the focus of world attention nowadays. This new interest has provided the discussion on the Council's membership with a fresh impetus. In the last chapter of ""An Agenda for Peace""  the Secretary-General observes that agreement among the permanent members of the Security Council must have the deeper support of the other members of the Council. It should also have the wider support of the membership of the Assembly if the Council's decisions are to be effective and are to endure. This raises the question of the relationship between members and non-members of the Council and of the Council's composition. The achievements of the Council in terms of effective leadership and decision-making  particularly during the last two years  need not be elaborated upon. Supporters of the maintenance of its current composition can hence  with some justification  argue that there is no need to change a winning team  or  to use a colloquial expression of our host country  ""If it ain't broke  don't fix it."" The critics of the status quo argue that the Council's present composition is a reflection of the balance of power of days gone by. This leaves us with a dilemma because both sides have a point. Important changes have taken place in international relations. The number of Member States has increased enormously since the enlargement of the Council in 1963. The Charter specifies in Article 24 that the Council acts on behalf of all Members. This implies that the Council should be  to a certain degree  representative of the international community. Were the Council to become an exclusive club disconnected from the United Nations membership as a whole  this might tend to undermine its authority and diminish its effectiveness. So what are we to do when faced with the question of the Council's effectiveness on the one hand and its representativeness on the other? A possible solution to this question might be found in severing the automatic link between permanent membership of the Council and the right of veto. A number of concrete options can be considered in this respect. One would be to consider the adoption of a double veto: two negative votes by permanent members being required to hold up a decision instead of one. Another suggestion put forward is the creation of semi-permanent membership of the Security Council. This membership would apply to a certain category of important States for a period of  say  five to seven years  possibly without the right of veto. To determine which countries would be eligible for this type of membership  it seems that two criteria are relevant: both the political weight of the country concerned and the degree to which its membership would contribute to a more equitable geographical distribution of the Council's composition. In view of the Council's responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security  it would appear to me that those two elements should be carefully balanced against each other. Clearly  the creation of semi-permanent membership is only one of a number of options that can be considered. A broad international discussion on this issue has already begun. The basis of this discussion should be in the agreement that any change envisaged should first and foremost seek to ensure the continued effectiveness of the Council for the United Nations as a whole. In recent years we have seen some very encouraging developments all over the world in the field of human rights. Many nations have taken the difficult but promising road to democracy. Their success will undoubtedly contribute to a further spread of respect for fundamental human rights. It was our hope that the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights  to be held next year in Vienna  would contribute to this positive trend. The Netherlands welcomed the process from the start. We are  for instance  a major donor to the fund that allows delegations from the least privileged countries to participate. However  the preparatory process has thus far failed to produce an agenda for the Conference. The Chairperson of the preparatory process rightly concluded that most States will be disappointed at the lack of results. The Netherlands shares this feeling of disappointment. Curiously enough  the results thus far have lagged behind the constructive and relatively harmonious results achieved in other United Nations forums such as the United Nations  Commission on Human Rights. The perfect example of this was the recent unanimity displayed by this Commission when it met for its first emergency session  which was devoted to the human rights situation in former Yugoslavia. In view of this sharp contrast  one cannot but wonder what causes the World Conference process to be so polarized and  subsequently  what positive contribution the Conference can make in these circumstances to the United Nations work in the field of human rights. Meanwhile  human rights are still  in practice  being violated in numerous countries. I have already mentioned former Yugoslavia  where outrage at the massive violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in Bosnia-Herzegovina  confirmed by the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur  Mr. Mazowiecki  has increased the calls for measures against the perpetrators of such acts. Personal accountability under international law and the appropriate machinery to deal with the individuals responsible are still lacking  but Security Council resolution 771 (1992) paves the way for follow-up action by Member States. My country favours the establishment of machinery for the systematic gathering of data concerning criminal acts committed by individuals with regard to the Geneva conventions and the human rights conventions. I believe that such an approach can be expected to have a deterrent effect. For the longer term. Member States could consider the establishment of an international criminal court  taking into account work already undertaken by  among others  the United Nations International Law Commission. Although it is clear that the establishment of such a court will not come about overnight  it is certainly worthy of careful consideration by the 'Assembly. The Assembly might give the International Law Commission the task of developing this idea further. The United Nations involvement in conflict settlement has led to a wide array of peace-keeping operations. The number of Blue-Beret military has reached an all-time record. The Netherlands contributes sizeably to United Nations operations worldwide and will continue to do so: taking into account other obligations and practical limitations  all units of the Netherlands armed forces can in principle be assigned for peace-keeping. We support the concept of making available contingents to the United Nations at short notice and have included this in our standing offer to the Organization. The Preamble to the Charter clearly states the United Nations determination to promote social progress and better standards of living. Many countries are confronted with a lack of social stability  mass migration  rapid urbanization and other problems which affect the fabric of society. The world summit for social development  in principle to be held in 1995  will allow us to address these issues at the highest levels of government. This will help the United Nations to carry out the tasks inherent in its important social mandate. The Security Council has rightly qualified the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction as a threat to international peace and security. This underlines the importance of combating their proliferation. Arms control and regional  political and security arrangements have their role to play. So have export control regimes. The Netherlands attaches particular value to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms  and it is heartening to see before the Assembly the concrete elaboration of technical procedures for this Register  agreed to by consensus by a representative panel of governmental experts. The time has come to render the Register fully operational starting next spring  in 1993  and we look forward to a universal implementation of its provisions. A convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons will be put before this session of the Assembly. It is a magnificent achievement for all the members of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. My country hopes that many countries will be amongst the original signatories of the chemical weapons convention  so that it can be strictly implemented. The Netherlands  as host country for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)  has a special role to play  and we shall endeavour to live up to expectations. With the chemical weapons convention achieved  it becomes all the more important to reflect upon ways and means to strengthen the biological weapons Convention  in particular in matters of verification. Securing compliance with the Convention could involve more than just voluntary measures  important though these may be. As to the third category of weapons of mass destruction  we have to bear in mind that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is up for extension in 1995. My country strongly advocates such an extension for an indefinite period. We welcome the progress made recently to strengthen the non-proliferation regime by both further accessions to the NPT and modifications of the Tlatelolco Treaty  opening the way for the entry into force of that Treaty for all Latin American and Caribbean States. We are are placing ever-increasing demands upon the United Nations. Cambodia  Yugoslavia and Somalia are only a few examples of its increasing involvement. This is not without severe financial consequences for the Organization. Quite frankly  I find it hard to believe that  at a time when we expect the United Nations to play its demanding role  an important number of Member States is not paying its contributions on time and in full. We believe it is essential for the proper functioning of the United Nations that all Member States  not just 5 per cent  meet the condition of full and timely payment. The United Nations will not be able to fulfil its task unless everyone picks up his share of the bill. Financial discipline on the part of Member States is as important as it is on the part of the Organization. With regard to peace-keeping especially  if regional responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security is to acquire real meaning  we would strongly favour Member States looking at the concept of burden-sharing on a regional basis. In any case  the present short-term solutions of ad hoc financing are neither satisfactory nor equitable. If we want a healthy United Nations to deal with tomorrow's problems  this issue needs to be addressed today. It would be an illusion to think that the current stopgaps  creative as they may be  will eventually suffice. As I have already stated  the opportunities for the United Nations to carry out its mandate are unprecedented. This is true for a number of conflicts which until recently seemed intractable. Cambodia is the clearest case where a United Nations peace plan is being implemented. Angola is another example of what the United Nations can do. The continuing dialogue by  South African parties provide us with a spark hope for the establishment of a non-racial democracy. There is an initial involvement on the part of the United Nations. Negotiations within the framework of the Madrid Conference have carried the Middle East peace process further after a long period of standstill. I hope that in this area  too  the United Nations can at some stage become closely involved. My friend and colleague Douglas Hurd  speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States  rightly observed that the challenge facing us in this turbulent time is to reinforce the system of collective security based on the United Nations. As I said earlier  the United Nations cannot be everything to everybody. Nevertheless it is clear that  because of the success our Organization has achieved over the last few years  enormous expectations have been raised. It is our duty to see to it that the United Nations is equipped in terms both of personnel and financing to face the tasks with which it will of necessity be confronted. That brings me  logically and finally  to the Secretary-General. It is a source of the greatest satisfaction to me to see Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in this august position. His profound international experience  his keen intelligence and the determination which he has already shown in tackling a number of issues make him very much the right man in the right place. I wish to assure Mr. Boutros-Ghali of the co-operation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the discharge of his arduous task. "
"119",5238,"NOR",47,1992,"It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate you  Sir  on your election to your high office at such an important juncture in the history of the United Nations. I should also like to greet the many new Members that have been admitted to our Organization in recent months. We welcome them all and look forward to cooperating closely with them in our efforts to strengthen the United Nations. Many of us had hoped to see a new  more equitable world order emerge in the wake of the profound changes we have experienced over recent years. Unfortunately  this has not been the case. The tragic conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia illustrate the challenges we are up against. In many ways they are similar. Underlying ethnic  religious  social and economic problems were ""frozen"" during the cold war. They were suppressed rather than dealt with in a constructive way. Democratic traditions were not allowed to develop. Some leaders have exploited the absence of democratic traditions  appealing to narrow ethnic and even clan interests. The disastrous consequences are brought home to us daily on our television screens. In Somalia the political crisis has been deepened by extreme poverty and by environmental degradation. We must strongly condemn the unspeakable cruelties being committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other parts of the former Yugoslavia. We cannot accept  and will not recognize  any attempts to change international borders by force. The parties must understand that they cannot achieve their goals by armed force. I urge the parties to the conflict to cease fighting at once. The ""ethnic cleansing"" in the former Yugoslavia is an unacceptable violation of  international law and must be brought to a halt. An international tribunal should be set up to punish all those responsible for the war crimes that are now being committed. All prison and detention camps should be closed down immediately  and the captives must be allowed to return freely to their homes without any further harassment. Strict observance of the sanctions introduced by the United Nations Security Council is essential to exert maximum pressure on the parties concerned. As the former Yugoslavia no longer exists  Serbia and Montenegro must apply for membership of the United Nations  along with other new States. We must all give our firm and unequivocal support to the London Agreement and the Geneva process. All parties to the conflict must now honour their commitments. The United Nations Protection Force  in which we are proud to take part  is doing a tremendous job under exceedingly difficult circumstances  particularly in Bosnia. We must all stand united behind the United Nations and refrain from actions that will only prolong the conflict. Our first priority must be to alleviate the sufferings of the civilian population by providing humanitarian assistance. A great number of human lives will depend upon how the United Nations manages to protect humanitarian supplies and monitor heavy weaponry. I strongly condemn the cowardly attacks on United Nations forces engaged in humanitarian supply operations around Sarajevo. Those guilty of these crimes must be found and brought to trial. It is now of the utmost importance to prevent the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina from spreading throughout the Balkan area. We must consider all available means  and support those measures which have already been applied. The recent decision by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to send observer teams to Kosovo  Sandzak and Vojvodina is an important step. While we are grieved by the tragic war  we must not lose hope. We must assist the people of the former Yugoslavia to accept and respect each other and to come to terms again  making peace through reconciliation. We must encourage the forces of moderation and good will; we must ensure that all parties take part in a peace-making process. We must act justly - and  if need be  forcefully. In Somalia the United Nations must give top priority to providing sufficient food and medical supplies to the starving people. This will be an important test of our collective ability to respond quickly and effectively in the face of natural and man-made disasters. Somalia also needs assistance in finding political solutions to its internal problems  and  equally importantly  in building a more sustainable economy. Norway supports a United Nations peace-keeping presence in this war-torn country  and we are willing to participate in such an operation. The time for peaceful change in South Africa is running out. We condemn the recent killings of innocent people  and call on the South African Government to restrain the police and the army throughout South Africa  including the so-called homelands. We are confident that this can be achieved  if it really wants to. We urge the South African Government to meet the reasonable demands of the African National Congress of South Africa so that negotiations can be resumed in order to work out the framework for adopting a new constitution and establishing an interim government. Norway is prepared to contribute at a practical level by sending observers to monitor the violence and facilitate the negotiation process in South Africa. We will maintain our economic boycott until we see some real progress in the negotiations. All these crises and conflicts demonstrate the need for more effective international crisis-prevention and crisis-management mechanisms. The end of the cold war has opened a window of opportunity for the United Nations to live up to the great objectives of its Charter. We must seize that opportunity. The Secretary-General's report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) is a starting-point for a serious discussion on how this can be achieved. We need to consider further the circumstances under which the United Nations should resort to real enforcement  mindful of our obligations under the Charter. Burden-sharing is essential with regard to peace-keeping. Every country has a duty to participate  including those which so far  for various reasons  have refrained from getting involved. Some 35 000 Norwegian men and women have participated in a total of 16 United Nations peace-keeping operations. We are prepared to intensify our efforts in this field. But our collective efforts must move beyond traditional peace-keeping into such fields as refugee-repatriation  electoral assistance and human rights monitoring. This concept proved successful in Namibia and is now being put to a new test in Cambodia. As a means of improving our capacity for such broader operations  we have proposed the establishment of a special United Nations institute for education and training in peace-keeping and related activities. There can be no lasting peace in the world as long as a large part of humanity lives in misery and despair. Maintaining international peace and security is a prime responsibility of the United Nations  as is promoting economic and social progress and respect for human rights. We must adamantly oppose any tendency to ignore the fundamental challenges of the continuing North-South divide. Otherwise the very future of our planet is in danger. In spite of remarkable economic and social progress in many developing countries  the inequalities persist. According to the United Nations Development Programme's latest human development report  the richest 20 per cent of the world's population receive 83 per cent of total world income  whereas the poorest 20 per cent have only 1.4 per cent. We cannot allow these inequalities to persist. The African continent has been particularly hard hit by economic decline  and a concerted international effort must be mounted to reverse this unfortunate situation. To break out of the development impasse  increased contributions from the industrialized countries will be needed  in the form of better market access for developing countries  more investment  increased development aid and debt relief for the poorest countries. But the slow rate of economic growth and high level of unemployment in most countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development limit demands for products from developing countries. The outlook is uncertain  and the unfinished business of the Uruguay Round adds to this uncertainty. Capital needs are enormous; competition for capital is fierce. Developing countries are the losers. The current financial and monetary instability poses great risks to countries and individuals. We need to impose stability and prevent speculation from throwing national economies into peril. There is no alternative to effective coordination of financial and monetary policies. But that coordination can succeed only when coupled with social purpose  a fair distribution and public efforts to create employment. In fact  most of the economic problems that we are faced with are linked to lack of coordination  to rivalry and to laissez-faire attitudes among industrialized countries. The developing countries are  as always  the ultimate losers. Their best line of defence is to undertake policy reforms to mobilize their people  educate them and and diversify their economies. Development is not likely to accelerate without good governance  democracy  respect for human rights  reduced military spending and improved redistribution systems  with increased emphasis on health and education.  Alleviating world poverty is necessary if we are to reduce the rapid population increase in many parts of the world. At present rates  the world population is doubling every 40 years  and could reach somewhere between 8 billion and 14 billion by the middle of the next century. Keeping to the low end of that scale will make all the difference to life on Earth and humanity. We must deal with population growth through an integrated human rights approach  including education and the enhancement of the status of women  improved public health and family planning. Confronted with these great challenges  we find it a sad paradox that development aid flows continue to stagnate and remain at less than half of the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Norway's official development aid has exceeded 1 per cent of our GDP for more than 10 years  which reflects our strong commitment to the fight against poverty. At the Rio Conference on Environment and Development it was made clear that we are heading towards a crisis of uncontrollable dimensions unless we change course. The North as well as the rich in the South will have to change consumption and production patterns. Developing nations came to the Rio Summit with open economic demands  and understandably so: for them  the Conference was essentially about development and justice.  At Rio  we achieved progress in many fields  but too little in most fields and none at all in some fields. We opened two important conventions for signature. It is imperative that we make them more effective. They will not work unless all major countries sign  ratify and implement them. Furthermore  Rio made it clear that the challenges of dealing with environmental threats and poverty are cross-cutting  long term  predictable and unavoidable unless we establish a world order of burden-sharing  common perceptions and common responsibility. Therefore  critical decisions remain to be taken. Traditional international conferences run by consensus can advance only at the pace of the most reluctant mover in each field. The future requires stronger decision-making procedures. Nothing less will serve us. I welcome the high-level Commission on Sustainable Development and expect it to become effective under a revitalization of the economic and social responsibilities of the United Nations. Norway proposed the establishment of such a Commission and expects to take an active part in its work. The challenge of economic and social development requires a more unified approach and stronger direction within the United Nations system. Over the years the number of agencies  programmes and councils has mushroomed  with too little inter-agency cooperation. This cannot continue. We must streamline our organization to avoid duplication and to improve effectiveness. The Nordic countries have addressed these challenges through the Nordic United Nations Project. Although we have made some headway  we need to proceed during the present session of the General Assembly. In view of the greater demands now being made on the United Nations  we must stress the importance of sound and predictable financing. Being the eighth largest contributor to the United Nations system in absolute terms  and by far the largest in per capita terms  we find it exceedingly difficult to understand why so many countries fail to honour their obligations. It is disappointing  to say the least  to read in the Secretary-General's report: ""Perennial shortages  the absence of reserves  and a debilitating uncertainty over the immediate future  are the main characteristics of the financial situation of the United Nations."" (A/47/1  para. 46) Immediately preceding this sentence the Secretary-General points out that some $900 million in assessed contributions are unpaid  together with some $844 million dollars towards peace-keeping operations. Frankly  this is an unworthy situation. We must increase our financial discipline. The permanent members of the Security Council have a special responsibility in this respect. And the question must be raised whether countries should be eligible at all for membership of the Security Council if they have not paid their dues. We must be willing to provide the Secretary-General and his staff with the necessary means to promote peace and to wage war against environmental degradation and underdevelopment. Our daily diet of printed and electronic presents a picture of a world in need of better governance and of more coordination. Our present forms of cooperation  developed in a less interdependent world  are still too weak and unlikely to stand the test of time. We should not pretend that they can. "
"120",5284,"NPL",47,1992,"I have the pleasure to extend to Mr. Ganev the warm congratulations of the delegation of Nepal on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. We are happy to have an eminent person like him  with wide experience and skill  to guide our deliberations at this particularly important stage in the history of the United Nations. I take this opportunity to express the great appreciation of my delegation to Mr. Samir Shihabi  who presided over the forty-sixth session with great distinction. I should also like to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his dedication to the ideals of the United Nations. His statesmanship and wise leadership are crucial in our collective efforts towards realizing the vision of the Charter. The pace of change in the world has presented humanity both with promises and with challenges. The events of the last few years have underlined the universal applicability of the Charter of the United Nations. Its validity as a universal guide has withstood the test of time and flux. Confidence in the Organization as the central agency for upholding the rule of law and as a forum for harmonizing the actions of nations has never been greater. We have seen a united international community  acting on the precepts of the Charter  overcome an act of aggression. After decades of paralysis  the Security Council is functioning as envisaged in the Charter. Efforts to revitalize the role of the United Nations in the economic and social fields have gained momentum. This unparalleled resurgence of faith in the United Nations is best symbolized in the admission of 20 new Members in a single year. We are closer than ever before to the cherished goal of universal membership.  A period of rapid changes is also a period of uncertainties. The old global order has passed but the new order is still very fluid. At this threshold of a new era in international life  we have a broad framework for a better future in the Charter of this Organization. The challenge before the United Nations is to harness the new mood and dynamism in international life and bring them to bear on the global problems facing mankind. It is the challenge to seize the opportunity to end war  to protect the dignity and worth of the individual  to ensure freedom and the rule of law and to promote economic development. In an interdependent world  the United Nations is indispensable for international cooperation. The task is by no means simple. In one single year  there have been upheavals of epic proportion: the break-up of political entities of long standing and brutal ethnic and religious wars. Narrow nationalism is threatening the norms of a stable international order. The cost in terms of human suffering has been appalling. The horrors of Somalia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina force us to ask if we  the peoples of the United Nations  are really determined to combine our strength to maintain international peace and security. The persistence of widespread poverty and destitution forces us to ask if we are indeed resolved to employ international machinery for the economic and social advancement of all peoples. The historic summit-level meeting of the Security Council in January this year was an important landmark in the search for answers to these and other questions. That meeting launched a serious search for new ideas and provided an impetus to meet new situations in the world. As the Secretary-General has pointed out  the tumultuous events of the last few years have already driven home several lessons: the need for democratization at the national level with  a corresponding process at the global level; the defence of human rights  including minority rights and the right to development; the need for new ways to prevent internal and inter-State confrontations  including the increasing use of regional arrangements; and universal acceptance of the rule of law transcending changing perceptions of expediency. These observations form the core of the Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace"". Several of the Secretary-General's recommendations can and should be implemented immediately. These relate to the more effective use of the traditional forms of peace-keeping  the safety of peace-keeping personnel  and the finances involved. His recommendation for greater resort to fact-finding missions is equally pertinent. Some other recommendations raise fundamental issues related to the perception of an international organization  its role vis-a-vis State sovereignty  and the role of the Secretary-General himself. My delegation looks forward to a full-scale discussion of this important document during the present session. It is obvious that there is today a greater need for the United Nations to address itself more seriously to the great divide between the rich and poor nations. This  along with the universalization of a human rights regime  is a fundamental issue of the new era. As a least developed country  Nepal accepts the principal responsibility for its economic and social development. Our development policies are directed towards creating a basic infrastructure for development. Human resources development is a priority with us. We consider it extremely important to improve the living conditions of our people  to raise the level of literacy  improve basic health and nutrition  and reduce the rate of infant mortality. We are committed to these goals because we believe that it is the human being and not the State which has the ultimate right to development. We fully share the view that these goals can be attained only in a society that is committed to the inalienable right of its people to elect their own leaders in free and honest exercise of their will. We have already put in place the foundations necessary to achieve these objectives. Principal among them are the constitutional guarantee of political pluralism  the rule of law  the independence of the judiciary  and safeguards for human rights. We now have the legal framework to enable people locally to take primary responsibility for their own development. With the basic political and legal grounds in place  I wish to reiterate our appeal for measures to reach the targets set out in the programme of action adopted by the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. While expressing deep gratitude for the generous assistance we have been receiving from donor countries and multilateral agencies  we look forward to increased cooperation to complement our own efforts to meet the needs of the poorest of our poor. It is now universally recognized that  if development is to be possible  the life-sustaining ecological systems must be preserved  and that development alone can make it possible to safeguard the environment. It is imperative to improve the living conditions of the poor in developing countries so that they are not forced to destroy the ecological basis of their children's future to meet the immediate challenges of sheer survival. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in June this year was the most potent expression of global interdependence. The Conference has established that developing countries need to mobilize their own resources for sustainable development. It obliges developing countries to take global environmental consequences into consideration in their development planning. It has also established the right of developing countries to development. It has underscored the need for the transfer of additional resources and technology from industrialized countries to enable developing countries to fulfil their responsibility to safeguard the environment for present and future generations. Equally important  the Conference has established that developed countries need to reduce the great burden they impose on the environment. The Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 place people at the centre of concern. Agenda 21  with its far-reaching implications  can be the centerpiece of a mutually beneficial international cooperation. Nepal sincerely hopes that the philosophical commitment of Rio will be followed through and strengthened. We hope that establishing a high-level commission on sustainable development will receive the utmost priority it deserves during this session of the General Assembly. While speaking of international cooperation in economic and social fields  I appreciate the ongoing efforts to enable the Economic and Social Council to play the role envisioned in the Charter. Political justice will mean little if the health and happiness of people  especially those in developing countries  are ignored. Indeed  global economic and social development alone can constitute the lasting foundation of international peace and security. We welcome the serious and out-of-the-ordinary approach of the 1992 session of the Council as the first tangible move towards restructuring set in motion by General Assembly resolution 45/264. The holding of the first high-level segment of a regular session of the Council was a promising beginning. Also important was the examination of operational activities including the workings of organs and agencies of the United Nations family in economic and social fields. The times call for an integrated approach to economic and social issues in the field as well as at headquarters. They demand that we avoid inter-agency competition  duplication and waste of limited resources by improving coordination among agencies  including the Bretton Woods institutions. My delegation has noted with appreciation the Secretary-General's determination to pursue restructuring of the Secretariat to meet these larger goals. One of the most satisfying reforms undertaken during the last year has been in the area of coordinating humanitarian assistance. My delegation welcomes the establishment of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs and expresses its warm appreciation to Under-Secretary-General Ambassador Jan Eliasson for his good leadership. We have already seen several examples of effective balance between principles and operational guidelines  improved coordination and governance. The situations in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia present unique tests of international commitment in this area. Indeed  it might not be too far-fetched to visualize the operation of effective humanitarian emergency assistance and the equally important roles of follow-up rehabilitation and development phases as new arms of the United Nations in preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. The relationship between freedom and democracy  on the one hand  and peace and stability  on the other  needs no reiteration. Nepal rejoices in the resurgence of democracy in various parts of the world in recent years. We strongly support this trend  which we believe to be in full conformity with the purposes of the United Nations. Developments in recent years have made it clear that  without respect for human rights  other achievements will have little meaning. The starting-point of democracy is the recognition and worth of each human individual. Respect for human rights alone makes freedom meaningful. The protection and promotion of human rights are becoming a common basis for international cooperation. Respect for human rights is an essential condition for the conduct of international relations in a spirit of openness  trust and confidence. The realization by many peoples within well-established political entities of their right to self-determination has raised the complex question of the rights of minorities. Clearly  absolute self-determination of each minority would have unforeseen consequences for the system of international relations. Clearly  multi-ethnicity  cultural and religious pluralism would continue to enrich most of the nations of the world. However  it is a duty incumbent on governments to ensure that members of minority groups are guaranteed the full enjoyment of the basic human rights common to all. It is also a duty incumbent on governments to ensure special protection when needed. The current upheavals in various parts of the world underscore the need for the United Nations to work out principles that can serve as common points of reference for the peaceful resolution of conflicting aspirations. The historic Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty  unilateral disarmament decisions taken by the United States and the Russian Federation  and the agreement reached between the two countries this summer are crucial steps towards lower levels of armaments and greater security. There is an overwhelming consensus today that the opportunity provided by the uniquely favourable international relations must be seized in order to achieve a comprehensive test-ban treaty. Events in the Persian Gulf have made the non-proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction the subject of global focus. My delegation sincerely hopes that at this session the General Assembly will be able to adopt the long-awaited Convention on chemical weapons  the first comprehensive international instrument to outlaw a whole class of weapons of mass destruction. In this context  Nepal welcomes the recent agreement between our two neighbours  India and Pakistan  on chemical weapons. We have been following events in the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with utmost concern. The use of brute force against the civilian population  especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina  has been appalling. We find the policy of forced mass expulsion abhorrent. We cannot accept the use of force to change internal or external borders. Nepal joins in the international demand that parties to the conflict respond immediately to the successive resolutions of the Security Council. We appeal to the European Community to redouble its efforts  in cooperation with the United Nations  to seek a negotiated settlement of the crisis in the Balkans. Nepal welcomed the extraordinary session of the Commission on Human Rights devoted to Yugoslavia. We look forward to the report of the Secretary-General on the findings of the Special Rapporteur on allegations of grave violations of human rights throughout the former Yugoslavia. We pay a tribute to the personnel of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  the United Nations humanitarian agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross  which have been doing an outstanding job in the most difficult circumstances. My delegation reiterates its full support for the territorial integrity and non-aligned character of Cyprus. We hope that the October round of talks under the good offices of the Secretary-General will produce the desired results. Nepal has welcomed the implementation of the United Nations plan for Cambodia. We reiterate our appeal to all Cambodian parties to cooperate fully with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) for the successful conclusion of this important United Nations mission. I take this opportunity to express my Government's appreciation to Mr. Yasushi Akashi  Special Representative of the Secretary-General  for the great efforts he has been making to ensure the successful implementation of the plan for Cambodia. We are following with keen interest talks between North and South Korea  now fellow Members of the United Nations. We sincerely hope that these bilateral talks will facilitate the fulfilment of the wishes of the Korean people for peaceful national reunification. Nepal is gravely concerned over the violence and the deaths of innocent civilians in Kabul. We appeal to the various Afghan factions to end the cycle of violence and to engage in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the war-torn country. Events of the past year have not diminished the urgency of finding a solution to the Middle East conflict on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Israel and the Palestinian people must recognize each other's rights: the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including their right to form a State of their own  and the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized  borders. The Government of Nepal strongly supports the continuing efforts of the sponsoring Powers of the Middle East peace process to bring about a negotiated settlement of the crisis. South Africa is today at a critical juncture. Negotiations thus far have indicated that difficulties in the establishment of a united non-racial democratic South Africa are not insurmountable. Violence should not be allowed to dampen hopes for a peaceful end of apartheid. My delegation welcomes the report of the Secretary-General and the endorsement by the Security Council of his proposal for involvement of the United Nations in order to put the dialogue on track again. My delegation hopes that the Pretoria regime will respond positively to the proposals contained in the report  expecially those relating to ending the violence. As I said at the beginning of my statement  the vision of the Charter is more valid today than ever before. It is  however  clear that models and policies of the past are not adequate to meet today's global issues. The magnitude and severity of economic and social problems in many countries of the world today are unprecedented. The emergence of the Security Council as the central instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security  as intended by the Charter  is a welcome development. The United Nations must seize this historic opportunity to promote with equal vigour and urgency international cooperation in the economic and social fields. The precepts of the Charter should be our guide in bringing in a new era of international relations. This family of nations must strive to create a world where all people are entitled to political freedom  economic and social justice  a clean environment and full human rights. "
"121",5348,"NZL",47,1992,"Mr. President  New Zealand congratulates you on your election to lead the Assembly and offers you its support in your task. One year ago I stood on this rostrum and spoke about the Gulf crisis and the way in which the United Nations  with strong leadership from the Security Council  had shown a firmness of judgement and a commitment to the ideals of the founders of the United Nations that reinforced the status and authority of the Organization. I spoke of my own country. New Zealand  a small nation in the south-west Pacific  which supported the United Nations  in keeping with our tradition of opposing tyranny and supporting freedom. This year I have returned to this Organization even more confident of the vital role of the United Nations in today's world  of the important contribution each nation  be it large or small  can make to the achievement of its ideals. Most important  however  I want to affirm the commitment of New Zealand  a founder member of the United Nations  to ensuring that this Organization adapts to meet the challenge of a world that has changed  is changing and will continue to change in the years ahead. To do that  the  United Nations requires a vibrant  active General Assembly and a Security Council that truly reflects the different regions and the different peoples of the world. The Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros-Ghali   has made his views clear in putting before this Assembly his report  ""An Agenda for Peace"". His message is summed up in paragraphs 75 and 76  where he says: ""With the cold war ended we have drawn back from the brink of a confrontation that threatened the world and  too often  paralysed our Organization. ""Even as we celebrate our restored possibilities  there is a need to ensure that the lessons of the past ... are learned and that the errors ... are not repeated. For there may not be a third opportunity for our planet ... ."" (A/47/277  paras. 75-76) New Zealand endorses that conclusion. We can also take hope from the fact that at last both the Security Council and the Assembly have the chance to work as they were originally intended  free from crippling ideological competition. Through the Security Council  and with the support of all the Members of the United Nations  we have seen decisive action to implement collective security measures on a scale never before possible. There is much still to be done  but no longer need the people of the world despair about impotence and inaction on the part of the United Nations. In Cambodia  in Somalia  in the Balkans  in the Middle East  the United Nations has moved to assist in the vital battle for human survival where before there was only the prospect of continued death and destruction.  In our view  the Agenda for Peace will succeed only if we support an agenda for action. This is no time for complacency. The heavy cloud of the cold war has lifted. But over the years that cloud concealed many smaller conflicts and tensions regional  national and ethnic. Freed from being bottled up by the cold war  a growing and frightening tendency is exposed to settle ancient differences by the use of force. The Agenda for Peace also reminds us that there are other critical issues which threaten not only the security of Member States but also the future of the planet itself. Poverty  disease  malnutrition  crippling levels of debt and negligible economic growth are scourges in themselves. They can unleash despair and anger that will destabilize political and social institutions. Environmental degradation does not threaten only our immediate surroundings and livelihoods; problems such as the depletion of the ozone layer  the spread of toxic chemicals  climate change and the overfishing of the seas put at risk the well-being of whole communities  and even the very survival of certain small island countries. Weapons of mass destruction continue to proliferate. We must take a stand against those who are blind to the lessons of the past and remain determined to acquire or expand their stocks of nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction. The Secretary-General reminds us  too  that ""social peace is as important as strategic or political peace"".  It is clear that a root cause of insecurity and conflict at the international level is the existence of social structures  policies and systems within States which marginalize minorities or other groups. Such tension will be resolved only when the social needs of the underprivileged are addressed. The proposed United Nations social Summit could have a catalytic role to play in this area. I suggest that it is only through tolerance and through talking to one another that we can all encourage and achieve full respect for human rights and implement the international standards as they were intended.  The other very important issues raised by the Secretary-General must be considered thoroughly. This session of the Assembly provides the first opportunity to debate them and I wish to outline New Zealand's views. First  let me refer to peace and security. New Zealand stands very firmly behind the United Nations as an instrument for collective action when security is threatened. The situations which the world wants the United Nations to respond to today are not the same as those of the cold-war era. New Zealand supports concepts such as preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping and peace-building. As a world body we know that consensus is important but collectively we must be bold  we must be innovative. New Zealand believes it is vital that the United Nations respond to situations which threaten the peace or cry out for global action  wherever in the world they may occur. We cannot  we must not  allow parts of the world to be marginalized or thought less important than others. The tragedy in Somalia is different from  but of equal horror to  that in what was Yugoslavia. Secondly  I want to endorse strongly the conclusion that there is an inextricable link between security and economic development. This is not a new or radical idea. Every political leader knows from domestic experience that a nation feels more secure when its economy is performing strongly. People in every country have rapidly growing expectations  but with the global economy very sluggish leaders are finding it difficult to satisfy these ambitions. Further  we need major sustainable growth in the global economy if the development concerns identified at the Earth summit at Rio are to be achieved. One fact  though self-evident  must be repeated: sustainable and equitable economic growth and development will be possible only if there is an open and fair international trading system. As a world community we need the courage to pull down the artificial barriers to economic growth. The solution is in our hands. We need leaders to say ""Yes"" to fair trade and ""No"" to their protectionist lobbies. If we knock out the selfish and inward-looking tendencies to protectionism and subsidization  we will create a surge in global trade and real growth in the global economy. It will provide the opportunities we all want - so let's do it. The alternative is bleak. History shows only too clearly what can happen if there is a deep and prolonged global recession. Political extremists come to the fore and begin to manipulate desperate people. Disintegrating economies fall into the hands of dictators  and international peace and security are quickly put at risk. But this need not be so. It is not inevitable. A breakthrough in the multilateral trade negotiations  the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  is achievable  given the right degree of political will. There is a risk that the political will may ebb away  that the focus may be lost  that excuses for delay may become more important than reasons to press on. Should that prove true  then the bold reform set out in the Dunkel text will go down as one more lost opportunity. We cannot afford that so we New Zealand - continue to urge the European Community and the United States to resolve their differences and to put the GATT talks back on track for a successful conclusion. For world economic growth  it is not an optional extra; it is essential. Just as economics and security are closely linked  the world seems to have accepted  just in time  that there is a third element to this equation. It is the environment. Everything we do has an impact on the environment. If we cripple the environment  it will affect our economies  our societies and our security. Moreover  these impacts will not respect national boundaries. Before the Earth summit  some important first steps were taken. The Montreal Protocol proved that the world had the political will to deal with the problem of ozone depletion. The General Assembly itself responded to the challenge of drift-net fishing and has secured a moratorium on that ecologically-destructive technique of fishing. The Earth summit  under the auspices of the United Nations  has given us a challenging work programme  ""Agenda 21""  to match the Secretary-General's proposals  ""An Agenda for Peace"". But international agendas only work if nations are committed to their success. New Zealand went to the Earth summit committed to working for consensus solutions to the problems of environment and development which ultimately threaten us all. New Zealand is a country endowed with a rich environmental inheritance. But we understand that our good fortune does not give us the moral right to point the finger at other countries which are struggling for their very survival. At the same time  our considerable experience in sustainable resource management - for example  in the development of new forests can be helpful in the search for practical solutions to problems of resource depletion. As part of New Zealand's commitment to environmental protection and to providing sustainable resources  we have just agreed to go ahead with the planting of another 200 000 hectares of forest. At the Earth summit  we accepted a commitment to augment our aid programme as soon as possible in order to assist in the prompt and effective  implementation of Agenda 21. Our development assistance projects  based on consultation with our partner countries  particularly in the South Pacific  have always had a strong focus on the environment and on sustainable development. But aid alone is not enough. New Zealand  like many countries which depend on agricultural exports  has been severely disadvantaged by a world trading system which handicaps non-subsidized and efficient producers. We therefore strongly support the call in Agenda 21 for an open  transparent and non-discriminatory trading system that reveals the real environmental costs of unsustainable production and enables all countries to pursue truly sustainable development on a secure and equitable basis. To achieve that would be to achieve a real foundation for peace and progress. I am not making these observations from an ivory tower. For its part. New Zealand already has one of the most open economies in the world. Yes  there was a short-term cost in achieving that  but now we are reaping rewards through higher productivity and international competitiveness. Despite the progress made from the ending of the cold war  we have not yet removed the threat from weapons of mass destruction. New Zealand warmly welcomed the agreement reached by President Bush and President Yeltsin in June. The two largest nuclear arsenals are to be reduced by some 70 per cent. That is remarkable progress and both leaders deserve and have our thanks. They have made historic progress but we must keep the momentum up. Unless we take decisive action  the dangers from nuclear proliferation will increase. Therefore we must build on the leadership shown by two nuclear-weapon States in declaring moratoriums. We must advance the goal  which New Zealand has unwaveringly pursued  of a comprehensive test-ban treaty. We must strengthen the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards regime. And we must secure an indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1995. France's decision to suspend testing has been widely welcomed by New Zealand and Pacific island countries in the South Pacific Forum region. It has opened the way for significantly more positive relations between France and the region  which I welcome. We hope the moratorium will be maintained  and copied by others. Another milestone approaches  with the presentation to this session of the General Assembly of a treaty banning another class of weapons of mass destruction: chemical weapons. Patient and persistent efforts over 20 years will have their reward. New Zealand has strongly supported those efforts and intends to be an original signatory to the treaty. We urge other countries to take the same step. And we must not ignore the continued proliferation of conventional armaments. There are legitimate concerns about the levels and availability of highly destructive conventional weapons. The implementation of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms would be a useful first step on the way to greater accountability in this area. Finally  I want to touch on the institutional issues the Secretary-General has raised. We strongly endorse the role that is envisaged for the United Nations to work with  and on occasions through  regional organizations that have some special contribution they can make. Already in South Africa we see cooperation between the United Nations and the Commonwealth beginning to bear positive fruit. In Somalia the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference have contributed positively to the United Nations mission. In the Americas the Organization of American States (OAS) has played an increasingly effective role. The United Nations role in Cambodia is of particular importance in this regard. The operation is unique and deserves the highest praise. But the countries of the region - which include New Zealand  with 100 men and women in the United Nations force have also played a major part in bringing about the conditions necessary for a successful United Nations involvement. Regional organizations such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been indispensable in this process. The fact of the matter is that the United Nations cannot do everything. Neither do I expect it to do everything - but free from the shackles of the past it now has a new authority which it must exercise wisely. To maintain its authority we must ensure that democratic principles are applied to the workings of the United Nations itself. That means that the small must be represented in major United Nations decision-making as well as the large. It means that there must be fair and regular rotation among Member States. And it means we must evolve processes that will allow constructive communication between the Security Council and the wider United Nations membership so that broad coalitions in support of Security Council action can be forged while preserving room for quick and decisive actions where necessary. New Zealand's commitment to a strong  effective and democratic United Nations has never wavered. At the beginning  at the San Francisco Conference in 1945  New Zealand championed the broadest possible participation in decision-making. Over the years we have backed up our words with a real commitment to United Nations peace-keeping efforts. We have participated thus far in 15 such operations: New Zealanders have worn the blue beret in Croatia and Bosnia  Lebanon  Cyprus  India  Pakistan  Iraq  Iran  Namibia  Angola  Cambodia  the Congo and Yemen. In addition. New Zealand supplied personnel to assist the United Nations with mine removal in Afghanistan. In conclusion  I want to return to the two agendas which are before this Assembly and which seek to achieve a new partnership of nations. Nothing is more important than the Agenda for Peace and the Agenda for the Environment and Sustainable Development. The United Nations Secretary-General and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development have both identified monumental challenges for the General Assembly for several years to come. They also highlight the reality of global interdependence. The way ahead has to lie in cooperation rather than confrontation  in a recognition that the future of each of us is tied up with the future of us all and that no agenda  no matter how noble its goals  will succeed unless first and foremost we are prepared to work for them. New Zealand is. "
"122",5393,"OMN",47,1992,"Allow me at the outset. Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. There is no doubt that your diplomatic experience will lead our deliberations to a successful conclusion. Allow me also to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate His Excellency Ambassador Samir Shihabi and the members of his Bureau for the exemplary manner in which they steered the work of the forty-sixth session. We are quite fortunate to have at the head of the United Nations Organization so highly qualified and skilful a statesman as Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has assumed the responsibilities of this international Organization at a most sensitive and crucial time in international relations. Since his recent assumption of his office  his administrative skills and abilities and the structural reforms he has carried out have shown that he is a worthy successor to his capable predecessor. We thank him for his devoted efforts  especially in areas of unrest and tension  and wish him continued success. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is convened in a promising climate that augurs well for international relations. The discernible features of the political scene have been drastically transformed. Confrontation has disappeared  giving way to great expectations and aspirations regarding an unshakable belief in the basic rights of man  the upholding of justice and the social and economic development of peoples in the context of a new world order. The prevalent international climate provides us with a rare opportunity to give priority to human solidarity and cooperation over any other consideration in order for us to establish that new world order on the secure foundations of peace  mutual security and respect  and the promotion of the rule of law in inter-State relations. The hopes and aspirations focused on the new world order  require  more than ever  that the Member States work together  analyse the current trends and channel them  as much as possible  towards the realization of the expectations this new world order has given rise to  through a number of effective joint actions of solidarity and cooperation that would be more effective than mere protestations of good wishes and good intentions. It is encouraging to note that the universality of the United Nations is being enhanced day after day. Since the last session of the General Assembly  thirteen more States have acceded to the membership of the Organization  namely Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan and Georgia. We welcome the admission of these 13 States to our Organization for  in addition to its significance for the principle of the universality of the Organization  they will no doubt enrich our debates with valuable insights and views. My country welcomes these new Members to the United Nations and wishes them and their peoples every progress and prosperity. The Gulf  in view of its God-given strategic  economic and cultural importance  has always been the focus of the attention of numerous States. Over the past decade and at the outset of the present one  the region has been exposed to grave security and environmental dangers  from the eruption of the Iran-Iraq war to the tragedy of the Iraqi occupation of the sister State of Kuwait. Thanks to God and to the solidarity of the international community  we have been able to overcome these tribulations. However  the remnants of regional disputes and residues of traditional hatreds have the ability to contribute to the instability of the region. Hence  we  in the Sultanate of Oman  proceeding from our keen interest in encouraging the factors of stability in the region  and seeking the security to which we all aspire  feel that it is high time efforts of all States in the region  without exception  were devoted to prepare for a new phase of understanding and fraternity. This will be achieved only through a sincere examination and analysis of what has happened and sincere efforts to overcome the effects of the past and heal its many wounds. At the beginning of this month  the United Arab Emirates announced that efforts they had exerted vis-a-vis the Islamic Republic of Iran this year have failed. The aim was to achieve an amicable understanding regarding Oman's  sovereign rights over three islands in the Gulf: Abu Moussa  Greater Tanb and Smaller Tanb. The Sultanate of Oman is gravely concerned over the prospects of negative developments in this situation. Proceeding from our belief in the principles of the Charter of the United Nations regarding the respect for sovereignty of States  non-interference in the internal affairs of others and peaceful settlement of disputes  we have confirmed the rights of the United Arab Emirates in this regard  as did the other Arab States and now call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran  with whom we have friendly ties and mutual interests  to settle this dispute by peaceful means in a manner that would guarantee the rights and common interests of the States in the Gulf Cooperation Council. The problem of Palestine has been the major factor underlying the tragedies and wars witnessed by the peoples of the Middle East region. Peace and stability in this important and delicate region cannot be achieved without finding a solution to this problem  which is the crux of the Arab-Israeli conflict. My country supports the sincere efforts being made to find a lasting  just and peaceful solution  which would take into account the interests of all parties in the region on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the principle of land-for-peace. Proceeding from this  my country has participated in the International Peace Conference on the Middle East sponsored by the United States of America and the Russian Federation. My country has also participated in the multilateral negotiations of the Conference and the Working Groups thereof  out of its belief in the importance of supporting direct negotiations  which are the basis and essence of the Conference as a means of contributing to the achievement of regional security  cooperation and confidence-building among States in the region and thereby contributing to the safeguarding of the interests of all parties. The recent developments witnessed by the region  in addition to what has been achieved in the sixth round of the Arab-Israeli talks and the multilateral negotiations held recently in Washington and Moscow  have created circumstances that are more favourable than ever for the achievement of a permanent and just solution that would bring peace to the area. Therefore  we call upon all parties to exert more efforts and show more patience and flexibility in order to achieve the permanent and lasting peace to which the peoples of the region have long aspired. The Middle East region has witnessed other developments that give rise to satisfaction and optimism. The Government of Lebanon has taken new positive steps to extend its sovereignty over the territory of Lebanon by way of implementing the Taif agreement. In this regard  my country once again reiterates its call for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which calls for the withdrawal of Israel from the Lebanese territories that it occupies. My country  through its membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council  together with its sisters on the Council  appreciates the outstanding role of the European community in articulating the orientations of the new world order in the context of the significant role played by the Community in preserving stability and security and promoting development in the world. The two groups  the GCC and the EEC have stressed the need to promote the peace process in the Middle East  have called upon the international community to help alleviate the suffering of the Arabs in the occupied territories and have shown readiness to participate in the reconstruction of Lebanon and reactivate the Arab-European dialogue in recognition of the close links between the security of the Middle East and the security of Europe. After a protracted bitter struggle  the Afghan people  with God's help  has managed to assume control over its country. The Sultanate of Oman did recognize the Government of the Mujahideen  and has welcomed the assumption by the Mujahideen Council to power in Afghanistan. My country is confident that the new Government in Afghanistan will cope with the new challenges which face it judiciously and competently. We hope that the international community will hasten to assist the new Afghan Government to heal the wounds and to close the book on the past in order to build a future of security  stability and prosperity for Afghanistan. The hotbeds of conflict and the regional and domestic disputes based on race and narrow political outlooks still plague some States and impose an additional burden on the international Organization. Examples of this is what is happening in the sister State of Somalia and in the former Yugoslavia. These racial conflicts and disputes have led to the emergence of a large number of displaced persons who are subjected to the worst kinds of starvation and displacement. While we commend the role of the United Nations in alleviating the suffering of these peoples  whether in Somalia or in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  we note that that role has been limited to dealing with these problems from a purely humanitarian point of view. If the United Nations role remains within those limits  such situations will persist. Dealing with such tragedies  in our view  requires a much wider role  more efforts and a drive to force the warring political factions in Somalia to move towards reconciliation. We look forward to a more comprehensive and effective role that would put an end to the fratricidal hostilities that are the source of these tragedies. Failing this  the people's suffering will continue for a long time and could threaten peace and security. Positive indicators in connection with the situation in South Africa bode well for finding a solution that would be acceptable to all the parties concerned and that would enable the black majority to participate in government on a democratic basis. In this regard  we emphasize the importance of the United Nations role in bringing closer the views of the parties concerned in South Africa and in helping them to sit at the negotiating table with the aim of finding solutions that may be acceptable to all. The international community witnessed  at the end of last year  the most important historical event in the international arena since the end of the Second World War  namely the emergence of the republics of the former Soviet Union as sovereign States  which immediately received the official recognition of all countries  including my own. As Oman's policy is to build bridges of friendship with all States of the world  we have recognized those independent States and proffered the hand of friendship and cooperation to them. Those republics have proved that the human spirit is invincible  and today  as they take their first steps on a new road  it is incumbent upon the international community to support and assist them in the interests of a new world order based on international stability and security. Last June  the city of Rio de Janeiro  in Brazil  hosted an unprecedented international gathering that sought to realize a common dream  a common cause that knows no boundaries: that of preserving a sound and sustainable environment in the interests of all mankind. Although they fell short of expectations  the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) have succeeded in endorsing an important principle: that of the commensurate and just participation of States in the protection of the environment and the preservation of the ecosystem. The adoption by the Conference of a set of the 27 principles concerned with environmentally sound development  in the Rio Declaration  and the signing by more than 150 States of the Conventions on biological diversity and climate change represent a step in the right direction towards the harmonization of development and the environment. My country urges the international community to support and implement the Conventions and decisions of the Conference  especially those which relate to helping the developing countries overcome their environmental problems  by way of consolidating the spirit of world partnership with the purpose of saving the planet. In the field of disarmament  we commend the agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation to reduce their strategic weapons to one third of their present levels. We feel that this agreement should be an incentive to make more determined efforts to free the world of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and  thereby  achieve the goal of complete and general disarmament  which is indispensable for world peace and security. By the same token  the adoption of the global Convention on chemical weapons is a significant step in the right direction. The United Nations has clearly achieved impressive successes in dealing with questions of peace and security. However  peace is not merely the absence of war  or the simple relaxation of tension between East and West. Peace cannot be achieved in its more comprehensive sense without a multilateral transformation of the world economy. The eradication of poverty  the resolution of problems that stand in the way of progress  such as indebtedness and the deterioration of commodity prices  the reversing of the net flow of resources from the South to the North  and the transfer of technology  should all become part and parcel of the policies aimed at the maintenance of peace assigned to the United Nations. The new realities of international relations should be the source of inspiration to us to reactivate international cooperation in the field of development. The end of ideological conflicts has increased the importance of this joint responsibility and the need for joint action. Hence the opportunity for us all to work together in laying the foundations of the cooperation and interdependence which we still lack in the fields of development and international economic cooperation. The polarizations and armed conflicts which used to be the hallmark of past decades had prevented the United Nations from achieving its designated goal: a more secure and peaceful world. However  recent developments have shown how successful the United Nations can be in dealing with and finding solutions to chronic and complex issues if its endeavours enjoy the support of Member States  as is the case  for example  with regard to the Organization's peace-keeping operations. The number of peace-keeping operations undertaken  by the United Nations over the past four years equals that of all such operations  during the last four decades of the Organization's history. This clearly indicates that whenever genuine political will exists on the part of the parties to any conflict  it becomes possible to find a solution or at least to accelerate the process of finding a solution that may lead to reconciliation. With renewed optimism  my country shares the hope of the international community that the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be able to deal successfully with residual situations involving negative and anachronistic elements that are out of step with the thrust of the new world order  and thus usher in a new phase of cooperation and peaceful coexistence between all the States and peoples of the world. "
"123",5439,"PAK",47,1992,"This session of the General Assembly is taking place at the dawn of a new era. The international structure constructed since the Second World War on the balance of terror between the super-Powers has broken down. We perceive new opportunities to promote peace and to accelerate progress throughout the world. Yet we face new and unprecedented problems  both regional and global. The international community must squarely face the challenges and seize the opportunities that the momentous developments of the past few years have presented. We must build a peaceful  stable and progressive international order on the debris of the cold war  an international order where principles of equity and fair play govern the conduct of States  where the weak live without fear of domination by the strong  where prosperity flourishes and where human dignity is safeguarded. Such a new international order can come about only through concrete steps agreed by the vast majority of the international community. The United Nations is the only forum where we can concert our actions to construct new arrangements for global peace and prosperity. The Assembly should take the initiative by adopting an appropriate action plan in this emerging era of international relations. I should like to take this opportunity to outline Pakistan's views and suggestions on the elements of such an action plan. To build a new and effective framework for peace and progress  the world community must achieve five major objectives. The first objective is the promotion of a structure of global security that ensures the security of both large and small States  of both weak and powerful nations. Historically  threats to international peace and stability have emanated from the drive for power and hegemony sustained by the accumulation of massive military arsenals. An international order based on hegemony will always remain unstable  because it is unjust. The challenge before us is to build a new international structure that would check the hegemonic ambitions of the powerful nations and promote disarmament at global and regional levels. Only through such measures can we create a just and stable order ensuring global and regional peace and security. Such a structure presupposes the revitalization of the United Nations on democratic lines to regulate inter-State conduct in conformity with recognized principles of inter-State behaviour  particularly the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination  respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States  non-interference in internal affairs  non-use of force in international relations and peaceful resolution of international disputes. A comprehensive programme of disarmament at global and regional levels constitutes the second pillar of a stable structure of international security. Significant reductions in weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  leading ultimately to their total elimination  and in conventional arsenals are essential elements of the disarmament process. Pending the total elimination of weapons of mass destruction  their proliferation must be arrested. We have welcomed the agreements between the United States and the Russian Federation which will reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals by half  in the present conditions of instability  further reduction of these nuclear warheads is a pressing priority. Pakistan hopes that their number will be drastically cut  leading to their eventual elimination all over the globe. This is no longer a Utopian goal. Until complete nuclear disarmament has been achieved  the nuclear-weapon Powers are under the obligation to assure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. With the end of the cold war  there is no reason why such assurances cannot be extended to the non-nuclear-weapon States unconditionally and in a legally binding manner. An essential element in the programme for nuclear disarmament is the acceptance by all States of a permanent ban on nuclear-weapon testing. The absence of a comprehensive nuclear-test ban will  in the long run  compromise the goal of nuclear non-proliferation. We further believe that the conclusion of nuclear-test-ban agreements among regional States in different parts of the world not only would facilitate the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty but would also act as an important confidence-buildinq measure at regional levels. Disarmament and non-proliferation are two sides of the same coin. Pakistan fully agrees that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction would increase the danger to world peace and security. Non-proliferation measures can gain universal credibility and acceptance if their scope and application are comprehensive and non-discriminatory. This pre-condition applies as much to nuclear non-proliferation as it does to the endeavour to control the spread of medium-and long-range missiles. With the end of the cold war and tangible progress in arms reductions between the two pre-eminent nuclear Powers  the urgency of promoting regional disarmament is greater than ever before. Today threats to peace arise largely from regional discords and divisions. The armaments race is increasingly acquiring a regional dimension. Global peace and security will remain in  jeopardy unless greater attention is paid to regional security concerns. In recognition of this reality  the United Nations has begun to focus on the need to promote disarmament at the regional level. This is evidenced by the adoption at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly of the resolution on regional disarmament by an overwhelming majority. This approach also featured prominently in the deliberations of the Disarmament Commission at its last session. This trend needs to be encouraged and strengthened. Pakistan fully subscribes to the objectives of the draft Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons  which has been transmitted to the General Assembly by the Conference on Disarmament. We completely share the resolve of the international community to banish forever this hideous instrument of warfare. However  the draft Convention contains some provisions that cause us concern. It remains our hope that these shortcomings will be redressed to ensure universal adherence to this truly landmark document. The second objective of an action plan for peace and progress should be to promote the fullest application of the principle of self-determination.  The principle of self-determination is the bedrock of the present system of international relations between sovereign  independent States. Over the past 45 years  the exercise of this right has led to the independence of the majority of the States represented in this Hall. All peoples under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation are entitled to self-determination. This has been repeatedly recognized by the United Nations. The process of self-determination remains incomplete. In its resolutions of 1948 and 1949 the Security Council decided that the future of Jammu and Kashmir should be determined in accordance with the wishes of its people  to be expressed in a free and fair plebiscite under United Nations auspices. Pakistan and India both undertook to implement those resolutions. That was the first time that the Council set out the actual process by which the right of self-determination was to be exercised. It is ironic and sad that the first resolutions of the Security Council providing for the exercise of the right of self-determination remain unimplemented. The passage of a generation has not extinguished the desire for self-determination in Kashmir. It is the children of 1947 who are now sacrificing their lives in the struggle for Kashmir's freedom from Indian rule. Since 1990 more than 10 000 Kashmiri men  women and children have been killed. According to Amnesty International  an estimated 15 000 citizens are in prisons and torture cells in Kashmir. The brutal repression unleashed by a security force  of over 400 000 has failed to break the spirit of the Kashmiri people. Pakistan cannot remain indifferent to their sufferings. We will continue to extend full moral  diplomatic and political support to the struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination. Peace and tranquillity cannot return to South Asia unless this outstanding dispute is resolved. Pakistan has proposed to India the commencement of a bilateral dialogue in accordance with the Simla Agreement to reach a final settlement of the Kashmir dispute on the basis of the United Nations resolutions. We hope this dialogue can start without further delay. We call upon the international community to persuade India to desist from its policy of suppression and to enter into a serious dialogue with us with a view to resolving this dispute in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council and in the spirit of the Simla Agreement. May I also urge the Secretary-General to use his high office to persuade India to desist from the path of violence and suppression against the Kashmiri people and to allow them the exercise of their right to self-determination as envisaged in the Security Council resolutions. Attempts by India to portray the 45-year-old just struggle of the Kashmiri people in terms of external interference are aimed at distorting the historical facts and should therefore be rejected outright. I reiterate before the Assembly Pakistan's long-standing proposal to station impartial observers along the line of control to investigate and verify accusations of interference. We made this proposal in all sincerity and are convinced that such a mechanism would help establish the correct position beyond any shadow of doubt. That position is that the uprising in Indian-held Kashmir is entirely indigenous and spontaneous. Indeed  India's persistent rejection of our proposal exposes the hollowness of its allegations. The people of Palestine too have been denied their right to self-determination. Pakistan shares the hope that the current Middle East peace process will lead to a just and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). Pakistan also shares the view that the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Arab and Palestinian territories occupied since 1967  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif  and the exercise of the right to self-determination by the Palestinian people are essential to ensure a durable peace in the Middle East. In South Africa  some progress has been made towards eliminating apartheid. However  the recent violence threatens to disrupt the negotiating process. The South African Government must shoulder its responsibility for salvaging the negotiations by taking immediate steps to stop the bloodshed and bring to book those responsible for the recent massacres. Meanwhile  international pressure against South Africa should be maintained until the positive changes introduced in the last two years become irreversible and the South African people's struggle for justice  equality and majority rule is finally crowned with success. Pakistan fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in implementing the peace settlement in Cambodia. We call upon all Cambodian factions to cooperate with the United Nations in creating conditions conducive to the establishment of a national Government in Cambodia. Pakistan's commitment to the Cambodian peace settlement is evidenced by its substantial contribution to the United Nations Transition Authority in Cambodia  to which we have provided a full infantry battalion. The valiant people of Afghanistan have finally regained control over their destiny. On 28 April 1992 an interim Afghan Government assumed power in Kabul. Pakistan congratulates the people of Afghanistan on their triumph and pledges to them its complete support and cooperation in the arduous task of nation-building and reconstruction. We are determined to develop close and cooperative relations with Afghanistan on the basis of sovereign equality and mutual respect. It is our sincere hope that the process of reconciliation in Afghanistan will be accelerated and that the people of that country will be able to live in peace and harmony. We urge the international community to make its due contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the rehabilitation of the returning refugees  as well as to the maintenance of the remaining millions of refugees in Pakistan and Iran. For its part  Pakistan is ready to make its contribution to the gigantic task of rebuilding the war-ravaged Afghan economy. Pakistan welcomes the new Members of the United Nations: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Their presence in this Hall is a source of strength for the United Nations. Unfortunately  one of these new Member States is being subjected to brutal aggression. This world body must strongly oppose this aggression. We call on the Security Council to take action  including the use of force under Article 42 of the Charter  to reverse the Serbian aggression and restore the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia deserves assistance in accordance with the Charter's provisions on self-defence. The Security Council should lift sanctions to enable Bosnia to receive such assistance. We further urge that an international tribunal be established immediately to prosecute and punish the reported war crimes by Serbian forces  including the genocidal practice of ""ethnic cleansing"". The world community must also make more determined efforts to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches the suffering people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Pakistan holds the view that the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist. Serbia and Montenegro  therefore  should not be allowed to take the seat of the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations. The third objective we must promote in an action plan is the establishment of viable structures for regional peace and security as envisaged in Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. With the end of the cold war  threats to peace and security are most likely to be regional rather than global in origin and dimension. It is  therefore  in the regional context that the barricades against war must be constructed. Pakistan desires good-neighbourly relations with India. We want to devote our energies to the vital task of economic and social development. We want our people to live in dignity. These goals cannot be attained unless a climate of trust and cooperation prevails in South Asia. In South Asia  as elsewhere  a balance in the military capabilities of the regional States is essential to build and maintain a viable structure of peace and security. Pakistan has made proposals to India for a regional or bilateral agreement to ensure nuclear non-proliferation  the total prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction  and mutual and balanced reduction of the conventional forces of the two countries. Pakistan and India have concluded agreements not to attack each other's nuclear facilities and on prior notification of military exercises and prevention of air violations. Recently  we also signed a declaration on the total prohibition of chemical weapons. Regrettably  India remains unresponsive to the proposals aimed at ensuring nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia and bringing about a mutual and balanced reduction of conventional forces. It continues to vote against the proposal for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in South Asia  which has been repeatedly endorsed by the Assembly. India has yet to accept the proposal for talks involving the United States  the Russian Federation and China  as well as India and Pakistan  to ensure nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia. All the other proposed participants have responded positively to the proposal. Pakistan stands at the crossroads of South Asia  Central Asia  China  West Asia and the Gulf. In the past  this region was the subject of the great game between rival imperialist Powers. With the end of the cold war and the emergence of the independent republics of Central Asia  Pakistan hopes to serve as a link between interlocking structures for economic and commercial cooperation in these adjacent regions of Asia. The admission of the Central Asian States in the Economic Cooperation Organization  grouping Pakistan  Iran and Turkey  will help towards the emergence of the region as a vibrant economic entity. Pakistan enjoys close fraternal relations with the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council and we hope to promote cooperation and moderation in the Gulf region. Similarly  the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation can make a positive contribution to the evolution of a new era in the relations among the regional States.  Threats to the security of the littoral and hinterland States of the Indian Ocean arise mainly due to large disparities in their military capabilities. The Prime Minister of Pakistan has proposed a conference of the littoral and hinterland States to agree upon measures for strengthening regional peace and security. The maintenance of an equitable balance in the land  air and naval forces of the regional States is an essential prerequisite for achieving this objective. The Assembly should suggest appropriate guidelines to the United Nations Committee on the Indian Ocean to evolve a new framework for peace and security in that strategic region. A fourth and essential objective of the Action Plan for Peace and Progress must be to revive global economic growth and restructure international economic relations on a just and equitable basis. As the Secretary-General has pointed out in his report on the work of the Organization: ""Political progress and economic development are inseparable: both are equally important and must be pursued simultaneously"". (A/47/1  para. 64) Growth in the world economy has been imbalanced. The gap between the developed and the developing countries has increased. The incidence of absolute poverty is growing. Recurrent economic recessions have reinforced trade protectionism and frozen the level of development assistance.- This  combined with the crushing burden of the external debt-servicing of the developing countries  has led to the invidious phenomenon of negative resource flows. We cannot allow growing economic disparities in an increasingly interdependent world in which destinies of nations are linked. Further deprivation in the third world can endanger international peace and  stability. On the other hand  the integration of the developing countries in the world's financial and trading system can contribute immensely to global output  as we have witnessed in East Asia. Indeed  there is a unique opportunity today to create a truly global economy  since the developing countries  as well as the Central and Eastern European States  have adopted the principles of free markets and open trade. Pakistan recommends the following steps to revive world economic growth and improve the plight of the developing countries. First  the major industrialized countries should take the policy actions required in the fiscal and monetary fields to revive global growth and break out of the current recession. Second  they must overcome the special interests that are pressing for protectionism  and conclude the Uruguay Round without further delay. Third  the debt burden of the developing countries should be effectively ameliorated. Countries that have scrupulously serviced their debts  imposing a great sacrifice on their peoples  could be offered relief through generous balance-of-payments support. Fourth  the developing countries should be provided preferential access in the regional trade areas in Europe and North America. Fifth  financial resources must be generated to meet the development needs of the poorest countries. Sixth  the developed countries should support mechanisms designed to stabilize commodity prices  including agricultural commodities. Seventh  an extensive programme of technical assistance and training should be undertaken in the developing countries to enhance their capacity to implement economic and social development projects. Eighth  additional resources and technology should be made available to integrate environmental and socio-economic objectives for sustainable development in accordance with the commitments of the Rio Conference. As the current Chairman of the Group of 77  Pakistan will work to evolve common positions for the developing countries on all the major economic issues  including the follow-up of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and the reform and revitalization of the Organization in economic and social fields. We also look forward to constructive cooperation with our developed-country partners. The present Government of Pakistan has introduced a free-market revolution in the country. We are seeking economic growth by releasing the dynamism of our private sector. These reforms are based on deregulation and privatization. We have offered generous incentives for investment  including foreign investment. We have encouraged export-led growth. The response to these reforms has been most heartening. Private investment has accelerated; our exports have continued to increase despite the global economic slowdown. The Pakistan economy has grown by over 6 per cent annually during the past few years despite the constraints of a drastic structural adjustment programme. Unfortunately  heavy floods have dealt Pakistan a severe blow. Over 2 000 people have perished. The damage to our public infrastructure  private property  and agriculture is estimated in the billions of dollars. We have fully mobilized our governmental machinery to recover from the effects of this natural calamity. We greatly appreciate the international expressions of sympathy and support. We are grateful for the assistance offered to Pakistan by the world community for relief and rehabilitation in flood-affected areas. Pakistanis are a resilient people and are facing this natural calamity with courage. The final and vital objective of our Action Plan should be to strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations itself in the areas of international security  economic and social development and human rights. Pakistan welcomes the renewed confidence reposed in the United Nations security role by the major Powers. This is  indeed  as the Secretary-General has said  a second chance for the international community to build the system of collective security envisaged in the Charter. . The Security Council can act as a credible deterrent to aggression against smaller and weaker States. Where aggression does occur  the Council can be the agent for the rapid restoration of peace and the redress of injustice. While the revival of the Security Council has already been celebrated  we must acknowledge that its determination in responding to aggression has not been uniform. In Bosnia and Herzegovina  for instance  Serbian aggression could have been checked more effectively. The Council's decisions will possess credibility only if they are perceived to be fair and non-discriminatory  in strict conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The actions of the Security Council will gain support if its procedures and processes are democratic and transparent. We should resist efforts to create new centres of privilege. We broadly endorse the Secretary-General's recommendations in his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" regarding the United Nations role in preventive diplomacy  peace-making and peace-keeping. We particularly agree with him that conflict-prone situations should be identified at an early stage and that the United Nations should play an active role for their peaceful settlement. Pakistan strongly endorses greater resort by Member States to the procedures for mediation  conciliation and arbitration provided in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter. Pakistan's participation in several United Nations peace-keeping operations reflects our unqualified support for United Nations peace-keeping activities. As a gesture of solidarity with our brothers in Somalia  Pakistan has provided the United Nations operation in Somalia with an infantry battalion along with vehicles and equipment. Pakistan is prepared to designate specific units of its armed forces for rapid deployment in the service of the United Nations. We believe that the General Assembly must also be enabled to play a more effective role in the promotion both of international peace and security and of economic and social progress. Our agenda must be rationalized. The decisions of the General Assembly must also gain in credibility and responsibility. Member States should observe and implement all resolutions of the General Assembly  especially those which are adopted by consensus. The Charter envisaged that the United Nations would play a central role in promoting economic and social progress and development. The world Organization now requires even greater support in order to be able to respond to the host of new global issues confronting mankind population  environment  drugs and international migration. The response of the United Nations membership to these issues will shape the political  economic and social structures of the twenty-first century. The United Nations will lose its second chance to realize its potential if it continues to be denied the financial resources required to discharge its growing responsibilities. At this Assembly  we should give serious consideration to ways and means of ensuring adequate financing for all the activities of the United Nations. It is the hope of the Pakistan delegation that the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly will adopt an action plan for peace and prosperity. We should endeavour to reach specific decisions to restructure international relations by the fiftieth anniversary session of the General Assembly. This would be an appropriate occasion to launch the world Organization on its journey towards the vision of peace  justice and progress reflected in the Charter of the United Nations. At this critical session of our Assembly  we are very happy to have someone with your wide diplomatic experience and wisdom as its President. I am confident that you will make a vital contribution to the success of our deliberations on the major issues of our time. Your predecessor. Ambassador Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  has established a superb record of achievements  for which I would like to congratulate him warmly. Our Organization is most fortunate to have a new Secretary-General who  with his distinguished academic and diplomatic experience  can comprehend the strong currents of history flowing in these times. He has already manifested his political courage in defence of justice  equity and peace. The Pakistan delegation reposes full confidence in the ability of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali to guide the membership of the United Nations towards the new era of peace and prosperity which we all wish to see emerge from the debris of the cold war. "
"124",5482,"PAN",47,1992,"I consider it a great honour to speak before the General Assembly of the United Nations once again. On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of Panama  I wish to extend heartfelt congratulations to General Assembly President Stoyan Ganev  whose election has been a tribute to his record and personal merits and a wise choice by the General Assembly. Before continuing  I should also like to express my country's pleasure at the election of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and at the splendid work he has done in the few months during which he has been at his sensitive position. We are certain that  under his leadership  the necessary consensus will be achieved to implement concrete actions that will promote political and economic stability  human and social development  and the restoration of belief in the principles that gave rise to this Organization. Today  because of the positive changes that have taken place in the world changes that have been called the ""new order"" those principles are singularly valid. We most definitely support his ""Agenda for Peace"". Without any doubt  the end of the cold war offers the world new and great opportunities to devote efforts and additional resources to the social and economic activities of our countries rather than to the waging of war. We note with satisfaction the progress made in various parts of the world through joint efforts to promote peace  security  and cooperation. The experience of the people of the Republic of El Salvador constitutes  for the rest of mankind  an example of how to settle disputes by peaceful means. With the signing of the peace agreements in the nation  an end was put to 12 long  grim years of struggle  bloodshed  grief  and suffering for thousands of Salvadorian homes. That is why my country  like the rest of the international community  reiterates its commitment to help the Salvadorian people consolidate peace  an indispensable element in the economic  political  and social recovery of that fraternal country. In the same vein  the recent conclusion of the century-old border conflict between Honduras and El Salvador  after the accepted ruling of the International Court of Justice  puts an end to one stage and begins another marked by understanding and friendship between those two countries. My Government welcomes this renewed willingness to resolve disputes by peaceful means. In those areas where  sadly  wars are unfolding  action must be taken not only to combat the scourge of war but also to fight its causes. Panama supports the machinery aimed at preventive action by United Nations peace-keeping forces in regions of hostility  in particular the implementation of preventive diplomacy and the peace programme put forward by the Secretary-General. In the area of regional disarmament  Panama  under the Treaty of Tlatelolco and recent proposed amendments to it  and as a signatory to the Ayacucho Declaration  has made a commitment to cooperate in efforts in this direction  as well as in efforts to ban nuclear weapons and eliminate conventional arms in Latin America. Taking into account the concepts of peace and stability  our country has truly and effectively abolished the army and is in the process of introducing constitutional reforms that will make it impossible to re-establish any kind of military organization in Panama. If the Panamanian people supports this plan in the referendum next November  we will be - together with Costa Rica two American countries whose constitution and laws ban the existence of an army. In this way we will have eliminated the possibility of re-establishing military regimes  of sorry memory  that did such harm throughout the history of Panama. Both domestically and internationally  we are in favour of diverting resources that have hitherto been assigned to military activities'towards efforts to promote the economic and social development of the people and the protection of the environment. If the great and powerful of this world have come to understand the necessity of reducing military spending  then there is even more reason for the smaller countries to understand that our wars must be wars against poverty and illiteracy. There can be no doubt that the Rio Conference marked the beginning of a new stage in a new form of development for the world and its inhabitants. We must harmonize the economic  social  political  and ecological dimensions. The concepts of sustainable development and integration are key elements in building the future of our world above and beyond the boundaries and individual interests of nations. But  at the same time  the equity that can be produced by development must be an important topic on our agendas.  Panama accepts the challenge to shift development patterns and attitudes towards the natural environment. In this regard  we need the determined cooperation of the international community to preserve the biogenetic heritage that has been bequeathed to us. I reiterate that we need to create a special fund to give the developing countries new and additional resources enabling them to implement national strategies of sustainable development. At the same time  it is necessary to make joint efforts to bring together Governments and the private sector with international organizations in an effort to achieve these ends. To that end  we should look to the results of the Rio Conference as a great opportunity to pledge efforts and resources at all levels and to formulate and implement national development strategies based upon Agenda 21. In my first address in this forum  two years ago  I referred specifically to our support for the incorporation of the Republic of Korea into the United Nations  which we saw as consistent with the atmosphere created by the end of the cold war. We are delighted that this decision was made a year ago. Today  in that same spirit  we must give due consideration to the absence of the Republic of China from this Organization  and we must also consider the impact that absence has on the role our Organization plays in achieving global cooperation and coordination. We must acknowledge the impressive economic development of that country and the progress made in the democratization of the Republic of China. These factors could help resolve many of the problems facing this Organization. For this reason  we invite Member States to initiate serious consideration of this subject in the spirit of peace and cooperation that has predominated recently. In the area of human rights  we have noted with satisfaction the decision to convene a world summit conference on social development  and preparations for the World Conference on Human Rights. It is important that the United Nations system assume leadership in these areas  facing  as a matter of priority  the social problems that stand in the way of improving living conditions for the most dispossessed in our societies. As I said a year ago  Panama has set for itself a number of social development programmes over the next five years. I am happy indeed to say today that the United Nations Development Programme has contributed effectively in this national effort to attack the areas of extreme poverty in our country as a matter of priority. Thanks to this cooperation  we have made considerable progress  although I must admit that we still have a long way to go. As part of the Central American isthmus  our country is continuing to make efforts to lay the foundation for commitments that will benefit our six members. To this end  the Central American Presidents  at the twelfth summit Conference in Managua  Nicaragua  last June  developed a working agenda. The purpose of that agenda is to bequeath to future generations of our countries better conditions for improving democratic institutions  promoting integration and fostering economic and social development. We should like to take full advantage of this new era in our region  for we see it as a historic opportunity to strengthen the idea of a united Central America facing the challenges of the twenty-first century. For these reasons  the Central American Presidents decided to place the emphasis at the thirteenth summit Conference which we will proudly be holding for the first time in Panama next December on the agricultural sector  which is the pillar of our economies and the primary source of employment in our region. Our efforts to participate in the activities of all international organizations recognizing as we do that dialogue is the best way to promote relations among nations - has led us to take steps to become a permanent member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and has led us to sign the Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer. I now turn to actions within the European Community to protect the exporting of our product  bananas. As a result of the visits of several Central American Presidents to different European countries  we now view with optimism the decision of some of these countries to oppose the resolution of the Commission of the European Community on the subject. That resolution recommends the imposition of quotas on the importing of bananas into the  Community  which would adversely affect thousands of jobs in that sector of our economy. At this point I should like to stress that the consolidation of democracy and stable social peace must be understood and promoted within a modern approach to economic relations. Imposing measures such as the ones mentioned in respect of bananas is certainly not in keeping with these new realities. At a time when there is an opening of trade in goods  products and services  it is contradictory indeed to see efforts made to restrict our banana market by applying protectionist policies that seem now to be out of date. Along these same lines  Panama views with optimism the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Association  which concluded last month. These negotiations were the result of the Americas Initiative put forward by the United States of America. That agreement will make possible accession by other countries in the region. Thus a climate of eguity has been created in respect of investments  markets and the transfer of technology. I should like to stress that the free trade agreement could be the mechanism that  over the short term  will make it possible to promote a plan for intra-regional free trade. This would redound to the benefit of our economies and be part of a balanced  competitive plan. In this forum  I should not fail to touch on our concern over the problem of drug trafficking. Because of our geographical position and our service economy  we have unfortunately attracted much of this unlawful and damaging trade. Consequently  my Government has promoted  and will continue to promote  serious  responsible action to put an end to drug trafficking and the laundering of money relating to these activities. We have signed international agreements and we are negotiating other similar agreements  and we are carrying out successful internal operations relating to supervision and detection in order to help undermine any incentives that might exist for this vile trade in our country. However  whether we are producer countries  countries used for transit or consumer countries  the problem affects us all. That is why it is necessary to reaffirm our determination to fight and curb these activities  for they not only damage the health of our citizens  but also promote violence and terrorism  which also deserve our most vigorous condemnation. Therefore  I take this opportunity to tell the world that Panamanians leaders and the people are determined allies of all those fighting against drug trafficking and the crimes resulting from it  which make it such a reprehensible activity. In this world forum  I should like to report on actions that Panama is now taking to take over the administration and operation of our inter-oceanic canal  in keeping with the 1977 Treaty. Our country will assume full ownership and autonomous management of the Canal on the last day of this century. In the meantime  some of the improvements made by the United States in the inter-oceanic region have been handed over to the Republic of Panama; other improvements will become Panamanian property when the canal itself is handed over. My Government has carried out many internal consultations on the subject and has drawn up the legal framework for the administration and utilization of these improvements. This is a commitment that Panamanians have unhesitatingly made to the rest of the world. Moreover  together with our partner in the Canal the United States - we are members of a number of national and bi-national commissions preparing for the transfer of functions at the appointed hour. Finally  in another commission  made up of Panama  the United States and Japan  alternatives to the Panama Canal are being studied in order to determine the best way to ensure the continued competitiveness of our inter-oceanic route in the next century. The last decade of this century finds Panama building its future with optimism. We are strengthening our democratic system and the institutions that are its foundation. Among other things  we are preparing for an exemplary electoral process in 1994  ensuring in turn renewal of authority in keeping with the popular will  openly expressed. We are taking advantage of a significant recovery of our economy  which will benefit our social development. With a keen sense of responsibility  we are preparing ourselves to administer our Canal  from the last day of this century. We are living in freedom and in peace with our neighbours. Panama today has a future  and it is promising. These policies and principles guide our domestic actions and constitute the guidelines for our international actions. That is why we support all United Nations actions and initiatives consistent with our principles and interests. In this world forum  I urge all countries to promote and consolidate peace  to foster their development and growth and to guarantee democracy and justice  for these will help us live together in a better world. "
"125",5529,"PER",47,1992," Permit me to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election  which symbolizes the spirit of renewal of the present period in international relations. Many of our countries aspire to emulate your country's efforts to overcome obstacles and spread political and economic freedom and become a productive part of the world system. The Government of Peru shares those same objectives  and is seeking to restore the legitimacy and trustworthiness that have been lacking in the past. To that end  we are seeking to modernize  to consolidate democracy and economic competitiveness and  above all  to base our actions on the interests of the majority. In a word  we are attempting to engage in a true process of redefinition and national reconstruction. The majority of the Members of the United Nations face similar problems  but nothing can be done if the Organization cannot begin to function as a genuinely multilateral association of sovereign nations with equal rights and duties as provided for in the Charter. To that end we must reform the United Nations and make it more effective  with the same perseverance and determination our Governments have shown in their national reconstruction efforts. Democratization through decision-making by consensus; administrative reform; a balance among the various bodies of the Organization; and improved cooperation for development: these are among the crucial factors for the future of the United Nations and for its prestige and authority. The developing countries have the ongoing task of ensuring respect for the principles of the Charter. On the basis of those same principles  the major Powers must redefine their real national priorities. It would then be possible to decide on a mandate agreeable to both sides that would orient the rebirth of the United Nations and prevent erratic extremism. The collapse of communism did not mean the automatic disappearance of the world's problems  but it has given the world community its first opportunity in 50 years to reorient international relations towards peace and well-being. We face an unprecedented  formidable effort that can now begin in propitious circumstances. The bases of this common effort are: development; the solution of disputes by diplomatic means; respect for law; and the application of fundamental economic and political freedoms. The United Nations system is the only mechanism creative enough to put this into effect. Only though multilateral cooperation will it be possible to conflate collective action and respect for national sovereignty without manoeuvring to preserve or increase international influence which would be even worse in a world free of ideological motivations or the imperatives of the cold war. For our countries as a group  it is vitally important to resume the North-South dialogue on a constructive and realistic basis. None of the global problems threatening the survival of mankind can be dealt with adequately without the active participation of the developing countries. The economic and social aspects of multilateral policy are in the interests of all Member States. United Nations action in this realm has been notoriously inadequate. With the ideological confrontation of the post-War period overcome  the most urgent problem today is the world recession and the consequent risk of regional isolationism. Undue concern for political and security matters or a narrow view of world problems can cloak conservative impulses and new protectionist tendencies  which would pose the threat of undue interference. The threat of this new world division can be dispelled only if we all agree that the various aspects of North-South relations together constitute the most urgent  critical factor of international security. None the less  Peru recognizes the importance and urgency of maintaining peace and preventing conflicts. We are prepared to expand our traditional participation in peace-keeping operations. The Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace sets out many innovative ideas for the future of United Nations action in this sphere  and we firmly support them. The situation of Peru exemplifies the unyielding relationship among national  regional and world bodies. In our case  this relationship  frequently addressed by the theoreticians of international relations  becomes something of a paradigm  because my country has worked to promote its national interests  respect for national sovereignty and multilateral action. In other words  Peru seeks to reconcile a political programme dealing both with the viability of its internal plans and with foreign affairs through a consistent economic and financial programme. At this point in international relations  we cannot imagine that a State like Peru can exist without coherence among those three factors. Without this  we would be under constant threat from fragmentation of sovereignty which has already done damage in other parts of the world or from harsh limitations of sovereignty resulting from the interventionist nature of the new global challenges and the consequences of hasty multilateralism. We view regional action as relevant  because we consider that the future of the multilateral system is based on the development of trustworthy regional organizations. These must play a growing role in the promotion of democracy   fostering development  in overcoming conflicts  in supplying humanitarian assistance and in maintaining peace. In our region  Peru is working to ensure that the Organization of American States will play its new role and go beyond the rituals of rhetoric and ostracism. We cannot continue to hold back a hemispheric organization whose work must be based on solidarity and must be effective to address the fundamental issues that threaten democracy and development. The democratization of international relations can be achieved in a number of ways. Peru believes that one of the most effective of these is the strengthening of regional organizations  which are ideal forums for dealing with any substantive issue. All the situations that now call for speedy and effective action are the legacy of the dynamics of the cold war. Today we need imaginative solutions that combine the global vision of the United Nations with contributions by regional bodies. This is no easy task  because both approaches require the political will of Member States; but given the uncertainty of international relations  that will must consistently be made manifest in all bodies where States come together  as is obviously the case with the wide range of neighbourly relations we enjoy within our Organization. The Government of Peru shares the desire of the Government of Ecuador  expressed by the President of that country  Mr. Duran Ballen  in his statement last Friday. He spoke about the need to promote joint development between the two countries. In this context  and bearing in mind the fact that Peru gives priority to the strengthening of its fraternal bonds with Ecuador  President Alberto Fujimori in November 1991 put forward a proposal for friendship  cooperation and integration. This proposal was aimed at reorienting bilateral relations to reflect the desires of our peoples to strengthen good-neighbourly relations and development. Peru is convinced that the common will for understanding expressed during the State visit by President Fujimori of Ecuador in January 1992  as well as in the interview with President Duran Ballen in Quito last August  when he assumed the presidency of Ecuador  will continue in further meetings between the two Heads of State  making it possible gradually to harmonize our respective positions and to deepen our relations.  As is well known  the crisis in Peru has reached an extreme because of the actions of terrorist groups and as a result of our dire economic situation. But we must avoid simplistic interpretations which maintain  for example  that ours is an ethnic problem pitting an indigenous population  the descendants of defeated Incas  against a political class descended from the Spanish conquistadors. This interpretation is thought-provoking and linear but inaccurate. Exploitation of man by man is a historic fact which many generations of Peruvians have striven to cancel out. But it is also a struggle to reconcile characteristics of an idiosyncrasy rooted in a profound and extensive mixing of races - characteristics that at times may clash but that at others can mesh fraternally throughout the breadth of Peru  fragmented as it is by its topography  and to the depth of the baroque culture of this the oldest nation State of South America. The cumulative ancestral problems of five centuries have given rise to a social breakdown which may now be called historical. To this unstable legacy are now added new challenges  including a quarter of a century of economic stagnation and internal migration  with its accompanying demographic explosion and mushrooming slums  and culminating during the past decade in narco-terrorism. Quite naturally  this has produced a tacit alienation between the State and society and as a result rightly or wrongly people have perceived the State as an obstacle or impediment instead of as a guarantee of meeting the basic needs of society. In the face of these challenges  an ambitious and difficult programme to put the country's economy and finances on a healthier footing was begun in 1990; it is now on the verge of bringing economic recovery and renewal of the State apparatus. An anti-terrorist strategy culminated a few days ago in the capture of the founder of the terrorist group Shining Path.  The conciliation Peru now seeks between its ancestral culture and the modern-day exigencies of competition is not impossible. It can be achieved by modernizing the economy and public institutions and by eliminating insecurity through joint efforts of the State and society against terrorism. What is needed is a representative democracy that is more attentive to the real immediate interests of the people  along with institutions that can guarantee an efficient dialogue between the State and society. This civic progress can be successfully made through a modern parliament  through integrity and efficiency in the administration of justice  and through the constant efforts of the political classes  both new and traditional  in order to surmount the country's problems in light of reality rather than of doctrine. At this complicated juncture Peru does not stand alone. It has enjoyed the understanding of other countries in the hemisphere and the thoughtful support of countries in other parts of the world. The understanding reached with regard to Peru's problems in the Organization of American States represents a historic landmark in the work of that organization and augurs well for its intelligent and dynamic responses to future challenges. The decision to respond positively to Peru's request for technical support and to send observers to the elections to be held in November is the expression of a joint effort to interpret  in a definite and transparent manner  the desires of the people and the Government of Peru to elect a constituent congress which will lead to new institutional viability for our democracy. The Shining Path obsession has not only divided the country but created antagonisms between the State and society  destroying both and creating instead a totalitarian response to the national crisis. The various stages of the Shining Path  stripped of anecdote and rhetorical effect  began with the exploitation of a short-lived and fairly confined Andean uprising  followed by coercive recruitment  employing intimidation and violence against peasants. In this context  given the movement's tenuous strength in the rural areas  it launched an assault on the cities  carrying out fierce assassinations of true urban leaders and bombing civil targets. During recent stages  the Shining Path had already established an unnatural alliance with Peru's most powerful and illegitimate transnational force  drug trafficking. It had filled the growing popular vacuum with its radicalized violence  taking new terrorist forms to extremes and moving from the countryside  where it had never taken root  to the city in a so-called ""strategic step"" which only the narcissistic cult of its leadership could sustain. This final stage of self-intoxicated obstinacy was the beginning of the end. Society reacted. From apprehension and despair  we moved silently to indignation and took the offensive  making it possible to create an atmosphere propitious to the recent capture of the founder of this Utopian movement that Peru considers to be the antithesis of its nationality. While it would be overly optimistic to say that we are approaching the light at the end of the tunnel  we can indeed perceive the fresh air of a new era of hope. The Peruvian people have overcome their paralysis and are now taking action against terrorism. Now that its genocidal practices have been uncovered and the Shining Path is being stymied by the renewed thrust of democracy in Peru  the efforts of the hemisphere must lead to international cooperation. In essence what we are trying to do is to promote the most effective integration of Peru into the world economy; at the same time  we must contribute to the country's internal security and cooperate in the dismantling of external agents who are still promoting terrorism in this nation. Here  in a word  lies the solidarity demanded by Peru and which the Charter requires of us  the United Nations."
"126",5576,"PHL",47,1992,"It is with special pleasure that the Government and the people of the Philippines extend to you  Sir  their warm felicitations on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. You were one of the most prominent and vigorous advocates of freedom and democracy in your country. We in the Philippines watched your struggle with interest and sympathy  and we joined the rest of the world in applauding the triumph of that struggle as the triumph of us all. That triumph led to your elevation to the high office you now hold in your country and  now  to your election as President of the General Assembly. Your election  therefore  is a source of special satisfaction for us. At the same time  we congratulate your predecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for his excellent leadership in presiding over the Assembly at its forty-sixth session. My delegation also warmly welcomes Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. He brings to his arduous and exalted mission decades of experience in and deep insight into the relations among nations and the nature and work of the United Nations. In less than a year in office  Mr. Boutros-Ghali has demonstrated not only an unflinching devotion to the work of our Organization but also a keen sense of the direction it must take in dealing with the great international issues of our time. Permit me at this point to express the heartfelt appreciation and gratitude of the Philippine Government and of the Filipino people for the generous assistance extended by the members of the world community and international organizations to the hundreds of thousands of victims of floods and mud flows from Mt. Pinatubo  whose fury has described by scientists as ""the volcanic eruption of the century"". Their dire prediction is that Mt. Pinatubo's mud flows  which have already buried towns and villages and turned the once green fields of Central Luzon into a grey and desolate landscape  will continue its destruction for several more years. As we embark on large-scale relief and rehabilitation efforts in the affected areas  my Government would like once more to appeal for assistance from the members of the international community and organizations even as we thank them for the help already extended since Mt. Pinatubo erupted in June 1991. We hold this session of the General Assembly at a moment in history that has seen the wave of democracy and national freedom sweep the world with astounding and unprecedented rapidity. This is manifested by  among others  the roster of new countries admitted to the United Nations this year nations newly emerged from the confining and oppressive darkness of totalitarian imperialism: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Krygyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  Slovenia  Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. This list of new States  new Members of the United Nations  reads like a roll of honour in the annals of freedom in our era. We welcome them  as we also do San Marino  to these halls. We Filipinos take pride in having been early in the ranks of democracy's march in recent history. In 1986  through the exercise of people power  we restored the institutions of democracy in our country. This democratic restoration found both fulfilment and renewed strength in the national elections our people conducted five months ago and in the peaceful transfer of power that resulted from the supreme exercise of the democratic process. The very fact of that peaceful transfer of power through free elections has affirmed  for all to see  the political stability of our land and  no doubt  contributed to the climate of peace and stability in our region. In pursuance of national stability and peace  our new leadership  under President Fidel V. Ramos  has embarked on a policy and mission of reconciliation among our people  closing divisions  healing wounds and  reaching out to all. Among the measures we have taken is the granting of amnesty to those disaffected groups which had taken the path of rebellion of whatever ideological or religious persuasion they might be  to whatever organizational or ethnic affiliation they might belong. Elected under the banner of people empowerment  our new leadership has chosen  through its policies  to ride the crest of the wave of economic liberalization that has inexorably rolled across the world and has  in so many nations  improved so many lives in so short a time. We have chosen this path for the same reason others have done because we believe that it is the best road to sustained economic growth and a better life for our people. Our new leadership  immediately upon assuming office  committed itself unequivocally to the liberalization of our trading regime and of the rules governing investments in our country. We have removed virtually all foreign-exchange controls  thus facilitating the international movement of currency. The privatization of key public industries proceeds apace. Consistent with the new primacy of commerce and economics in relations between nations  we have placed trade and economic relations at the top of our diplomatic priorities. Only a few weeks ago  in Jakarta  the capital city of our Indonesian neighbour  we joined the Non-Aligned Movement  in which the Philippines had been an observer for many years. Far from being rendered irrelevant by the end of the cold war  the Non-Aligned Movement  we found  was larger  stronger and even more relevant than ever before. Many of the old divisions in the Movement had closed  and a new cohesion had been found. Moreover  the Movement had turned more of its attention to problems of trade  finance  technology and all those other things that make up economic relations between nations. The end of the cold war may have greatly diminished the likelihood of worldwide conflict and global cataclysm  but it has given rise to new challenges that are just as threatening for the peoples of many nations and regions  even as many of the old issues remain unresolved. The weight of their external debt continues to crush the economies of many developing countries  including those countries  like the Philippines  which have made strenuous efforts to pay their debts religiously. Surely  with some imagination and creativity  and a modicum of good will and enlightened self-interest  the nations of the world can  together  arrive at some solution that would allow the debtor countries to develop and get out from under the crushing burden of their debt. At the very least  the debtor countries should be given access to their actual and potential markets without any artificial restrictions  to allow them to develop their economies and improve the lives of their peoples while they continue to service their debts from meagre resources. More and more of the world's nations have adhered ever more strongly to the proposition that economic liberalization is vital to the improvement of industrial productivity and the generation of economic growth. And yet  most ironically  protectionist barriers continue to rise and to hamper the flow of goods and services. The world's peoples call upon the international community  in particular upon the developed countries  to lay aside narrow self-interest and push forward the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations to a speedy and successful conclusion. The formation of trading blocs in some areas has aroused the apprehension of countries outside those blocs with respect to their potential for artificially diverting trade and investment  diversions damaging to the efficiency of the global economic system. We in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have committed ourselves to the formation of an ASEAN free trade area that would facilitate trade among ourselves. But we are determined to keep ourselves open to world trade  on which our economies depend so much.  Each country has an inalienable right to development. And the United Nations has a paramount role in seeing to it that it is realized. The ongoing restructuring and revitalization process in the economic and social fields should therefore be geared towards the effective discharge of this role by the United Nations system. The continuing scourge of poverty  the rapid increase in population  the uneven rate of economic growth among countries and the asymmetry in the economic and social structures of nations  together with the dazzling advances in transportation and communication  have given rise to a new phenomenon of our times: the massive migration of labour. As one of the largest sources of this migration  the Philippines is convinced that it is now time for the international community to deal with this phenomenon no longer in haphazard and isolated ways  but on a planned and strategic basis and on an international scale. In so doing  we would do well to heed the appeal of the Secretary-General to accord deeper understanding and respect to the rights and needs of the more vulnerable groups of society. A substantial part of the migration of labour is the thousands of young women from many developing countries who venture forth to more affluent countries in search of a better life for themselves and their families  only to fall victim to unspeakable abuse  in many cases to violence  sometimes ending in death  simply because they are women. Roaming the streets of the world are 145 million children homeless  hungry  neglected  in most cases victims of abuse and mistreatment by adults. Thousands of the disabled and the aging  particularly in the developing countries  are cast away  stripped of their dignity  from the mainstream of society. The untrammelled population growth in many regions  the profligate use of the Earth's resources and the pollution of the land  water and air have severely damaged the Earth's life-sustaining ecology in many places  threatening the livelihoods of farmers and fishermen and the health of everyone. It was therefore with a keen sense of hope and high expectations that the Philippines participated in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro last June. At that Conference  the collective will of the international community was marshalled at the highest level of leadership on behalf of the sustainable development of our Earth and its resources. The Philippines applauds its considerable achievements and remains committed to its goals and ideals  as embodied in Agenda 21  the implementation of which requires adequate new and additional financial resources. To carry out on a national scale the objectives set forth in Agenda 21  my President has created the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development  which counts non-governmental organizations and  particularly  the youth among its members. I am also pleased to announce that  in observance of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People  the Philippines will host in April next year a Global Youth Earth Summit or Global YES in cooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme's Global Youth Forum and with the full endorsement and support of the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  and the International Labour Organisation. I appeal to the world to support this undertaking. The cold war's end has lifted a great pall of global threat from over the Earth and closed a fundamental division in the international community. It has thus opened new vistas of hope for peace and global security  directly leading to major advances in some of the world's hitherto intractable conflicts: Afghanistan  Cambodia  the Middle East  Central America  South Africa. Nevertheless  intra-regional and intra-national conflicts continue to ravage people's lives and homes. The end of super-Power confrontation and the dissolution of empires and blocs have freed nations and dismantled tyrannies. They have also unleashed age-old hostilities between antagonistic groups and released them to erupt in tragic violence. These conflicts  new and old  have taken various forms and dimensions. In the Middle East  movement in the peace process has given rise to new  albeit modest  hopes. However  hope must be tempered still  as the basic cause of conflict the denial of a homeland and sovereignty to the Palestinian people remains unresolved. In South Africa  the institutions of apartheid have been dismantled  a hopeful development that can be attributed in no small measure to the resolute and patient efforts of the United Nations and the international community. We are heartened that the stalled negotiations on the future of that country may finally get back on track with the expected resumption of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa. In Somalia  intertribal warfare conspires with the cruelties of nature to inflict upon the people of that unhappy land death by violence or starvation. The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina  specifically its Muslim population  are subjected to the barbarity of ethnic cleansing and the horrors of fratricidal war while the international community helplessly looks on. Similar forms  if not similar degrees  of ethnic violence have erupted in some places in the former Soviet Union. In our own region of South-East Asia  in Cambodia  a peace agreement painstakingly worked out by the United Nations  the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  other interested Governments and the Cambodian factions themselves has provided for and led to the mounting of the largest peace-keeping operation of the United Nations and the assumption of one of its gravest responsibilities  the United Nations Transitional Authority for Cambodia  to which the Philippines has contributed a contingent of policemen and naval observers. However  one of the factions has  of late  chosen not to participate further in the peace process until its conditions  some of which go beyond the terms of the Paris peace Agreement  are met. It is now the responsibility of the international community to ensure that the fabric of imminent peace does not unravel and to place the peace process back on track. Conflicting claims in the South China Sea have given rise to acute concern among the countries involved and other States with interests in the  area. Last July the Foreign Ministers of ASEAN issued in Manila the ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea  calling on all claimants to settle their disputes peacefully  pledging to embark on cooperative endeavours in the area and inviting all parties concerned to subscribe to the Declaration. Dialogues have been taking place in the region involving officials and academicians from the claimant States and other interested parties. It is our hope that these dialogues will help to avert misunderstanding and conflict and eventually lead to the day when this vast  vital and strategic portion of the sea can be transformed from an area of incipient tension into a region of enduring peace and cooperation. All these fall squarely under the purposes and principles of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in South-East Asia  which the signatories  including the Philippines  are requesting the General Assembly to endorse at this session. Thus  even as the world welcomes the cold war's end and the march of freedom and democracy across the earth  in the relations among nations old wounds fester  break out and recur and new ones are opened. And yet hopes run higher than they have ever done since the last great war. These hopes are focused especially on the new possibilities for the United Nations in its mission of preventing war  making peace  keeping the peace and building for peace. In this new era of opportunity it is both possible and imperative for the United Nations to discharge the role envisioned for it by the Charter as the primary keeper of peace and security in the world. It is therefore extremely fitting that in his first report on the work of the Organization our new Secretary-General dwells almost exclusively on this role of the United Nations and the opportunities opened for it by the historic changes of recent times. The Philippines welcomes the Secretary-General's report  ""An Agenda for Peace Preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping "" and is studying it with great attention. We commend it to the world for serious consideration  for it seeks to bring the United Nations back to its roots as an organization with an effective capacity to make peace and keep the peace. The report is filled with wise  timely and practical prescriptions  and I should like to single out a few. We support the Secretary-General's call for an enlarged and more effective role for the International Court of Justice. We join the Secretary-General in reaffirming the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes  as approved by the General Assembly. We endorse his recognition of the need to relieve the economic difficulties of States that are affected by sanctions imposed on another State under Article 41 of the Charter. We commend for especially close consideration the Secretary-General's bold proposals for giving life to Chapter Vll of the Charter  particularly Article 42  which authorizes the Security Council to take military action to maintain or restore international peace and security  and Article 43  which mandates Members of the United Nations to place armed forces and facilities on call for this purpose. Granting the United Nations increased power and greater authority for peace-keeping and enforcement action would gain stronger support from the international community if the Security Council could function with a greater degree of democracy than heretofore. Why  for example  should a region with approximately 15 per cent of the world's population and 23 per cent of the total membership of the United Nations have 40 per cent representation in the Security Council this year  with three having the power of veto?  Clearly  that is a legitimate question. However  the composition of the Security Council is but one of the provisions in the Charter that could stand improvement. My delegation appreciates current efforts to restructure and revitalize the economic and social sectors of the United Nations and to reform both the General Assembly and the Secretariat. We note  however  that such efforts are often limited by a hesitation to review the United Nations Charter itself. Addressing the work of the Special Committee on the Charter and the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization during the twenty-ninth session of the General Assembly  the then Philippine Foreign Minister  General Carlos P. Romulo  said: ""At no time in history has it been more clear that the many and closely interrelated global problems that beset us will not yield to piecemeal and national solutions. The paramount importance of the United Nations as the capstone of human society has been reaffirmed with great force by the momentous events even of this single year. The design of a new world economic order  the mobilizing of world agriculture  a global approach to population problems  the equitable redistribution of world economic resources  the achievement of disarmament and peace all require an ever more effective and more efficient world Organization. ""For these reasons  it is more than ever appropriate that we are continuing our consideration of the improvement of the United Nations itself. The centrality of the United Nations is obvious and inescapable. The increasing value of the United Nations is undoubted. But its rate of adaptation to rapidly moving world affairs is doubted; its adequacy to perform the functions thrust upon it by its Members  and simply by the urgent course of world history  is doubted. ""When we began this discussion in 1970  on the twenty-fifth anniversary of our world Organization  the effort seemed pertinent enough. But now  as we continue  the accelerating pace of change in the world has already caught up with us and threatens to pass us by. The mechanisms of the United Nations are increasingly creaky and primitive in light of the task of plenary management that the Organization is increasingly called upon to assume. While the prescience of the founders was remarkable  and they succeeded in designing a flexible and adaptable Organization with a Charter of enduring worth  at the same time it was wholly impossible for them to anticipate the speed with which events would carry us into the interdependent global age and the requirements that would be placed on our world body.""  General Romulo  who happened to be my father and one of the founders of the United Nations  made these remarks in 1974. He might as well be making them today. I do not wish to state the obvious  but I know that my father's message rings loud and clear in this Hall. Let us now proceed to rectify the omissions of the past. Towards this end  the Philippine delegation submits that the time has come for the United Nations to avail itself of the provisions of Article 109 regarding the convening of a General Conference to review the Charter. My delegation will consult with like-minded Members in the coming year with a view to definitively addressing this proposal  specifically through a resolution calling for such a review conference  which  according to the Charter itself  should have been placed on the agenda of the General Assembly 10 years after its adoption in 1945. We are only three years shy of the fiftieth anniversary of our Organization. Its celebration  we believe  would be further enhanced by the adoption and implementation of such a resolution. Through it  we hope to contribute to the noble work of making the United Nations a truly effective instrument  as the signatories envisioned it to be  for saving ""succeeding generations from the scourge of war"" and for promoting ""social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"". The confluence of historic events in our time presents us with a unique opportunity to fulfil the mandate from our founders. Let us prove ourselves worthy of their trust. "
"127",5636,"PNG",47,1992,"On behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea  I should like to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your personal presence in this Hall  and your unanimous election to preside over our proceedings  are symbolic not only of the stirring changes which have been occurring in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union  but of the manner in which they have been welcomed around the world. In offering you my delegation's greetings  cooperation and support  I should also like to pay tribute to the efficient manner in which your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  performed his duties. Just as your election. Sir  is symbolic of wider changes in the world  so is the presence here for the first time of delegations from States which for a period were incorporated in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. My delegation takes very great pleasure in welcoming the membership of  and participation in the United Nations by  the nine States which were once part of the Soviet Union and the three States which were once part of Yugoslavia whose representatives have just joined us. Their presence provides eloquent testimony to the power of ordinary people to resist - and eventually to overcome - both the ideology and the technology that are used in order to oppress them. With the addition of San Marino  the goal of universal membership - and of global coverage - of the United Nations is now in sight. Coming from a region where membership of the United Nations is less widespread than it is in other parts of the world  I pledge my Government's cooperation in the efforts to strengthen links between other South Pacific island States and the United Nations. Previous statements in this debate have made it quite clear that we have  in the words of the Secretary-General in ""An Agenda for Peace""  ""entered a time of global transition."" (A/47/277  para. 11) The Jakarta Message issued by the Tenth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement  of which my Government has just become a full member  describes the present as ""a time of profound change and rapid transition."" But transition to what? And will the effects be the same around the globe? Even as we welcome the end of the cold war  we would do well to bear in mind the observation made in ""An Agenda for Peace""  that ""the issues between States north and south grow more acute."" (A/47/277. para. 8) It is  again in the words of the Jakarta Message: ""a time of great promise as well as grave challenge  a time of opportunity amidst pervasive uncertainty."" It is no accident that the preamble to the Charter contains not only political  but economic and social objectives  or that the Charter provides for both a Security Council and an Economic and Social Council. Security has never been simply a military or a political question; it has always had economic and social aspects. For people in developing countries in particular the economic and social aspects of security are inseparable from and often of great immediate importance than the military and political aspects. If the transition on which so many previous speakers believe we have embarked is to be towards global peace  then we need to pay greater attention to the economic and social issues which divide North and South. Thus my Government supports the proposal to convene  looks forward to taking part in. and hopes for a positive outcome from  the world summit for social development proposed to be held in 1995. Disappointed though my Government is in the level of agreement reached at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in June this year  we shall continue to support the UNCED effort in particular and similar efforts by the United Nations generally. We have therefore offered to host a regional post-Rio seminar to follow up on UNCED in Port Moresby in November. My Government welcomes the changes which have allowed people in Central and Eastern Europe  the Caucasus and Central Asia to participate directly in national political and economic life again. We welcome them and their Governments to greater participation in international political and economic affairs  too. We welcome no less the changes which have led to the replacement of dictatorships in Africa  Latin America and elsewhere. But in doing so I would not be honest unless I added that we are concerned about ensuring that the change is both comprehensive and enduring. My Government is profoundly disturbed by the savage violence and terrible suffering being experienced by the victims of ""ethnic cleansing"" in the former Yugoslavia and of interracial  religious and ethnic conflicts there and elsewhere. We sympathize with the concerns expressed by the members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  and support the efforts being made by the United Nations and the European Economic Community to reduce these conflicts and to provide aid. But  as the Secretary-General has so pointedly reminded the world  there are terrible conflicts and suffering no less worthy of attention in other parts of the world  including Somalia. It seems distressingly significant that evert after the end of the cold war  and during the global transition which the Secretary-General has so eloquently analysed  part of the world where most humans live and where needs are greatest is still referred to and treated as a very poor third. I ask you. Sir  to cast your mind back to the 1960s  when foreign domination came to an end in many parts of the world  a record number of new Members was admitted to the United Nations and the prospects for democracy and development seemed  by common consent  to be quite bright. Then think of the economic difficulties which often followed  and the dictatorships which all too frequently lasted until the present transition. And then ask why  whatever our hopes might be  we should expect that the future will be different.  The world has learned or  at least  should have learned - from the past. But have we all drawn the right conclusions? And what have we done to act on even the most obvious of our conclusions? It is one thing to welcome the holding of free elections. It is quite another to be certain either that they make a difference  or that they will continue to be held in an orderly  constitutional and fair way. Politicians characteristically promise results. Their ability to be re-elected depends on results. So  too  does democracy itself. In other words  democracy  like security  is more than a matter of politics; it also has economic and social roots. In developing countries or  more precisely  countries where development is a far-distant aim rather than a near-reality democracy depends not only on opportunities for political participation  but on opportunities for economic and social participation as well. As one who has played a modest part in constitution-making in Papua New Guinea  I am proud that the National Goals and Directive Principles contained in our national Constitution explicitly recognize that point. I can recall a time  before Papua New Guinea became independent  when not only free elections but free markets were widely regarded as characteristic or  at least  attainable - goals of many developing countries. I can also recall the pain and anger felt by ordinary village people when they discovered that free elections and free markets did not necessarily benefit them. I am  in fact  spokesman for a movement which mobilized tens of thousands of people to ensure that political and economic development would serve their interests  and which paved the way to Papua New Guinea's independence. It is precisely because of the lessons I learned from  and with  my people that I have chosen to make opportunity and participation the main theme of the policy I shall follow as my Government's Minister for Foreign Affairs. Those lessons are also among the reasons why my Government will be seeking support for an initiative designed to help identify  create  maintain  diversify and enlarge opportunities for economic participation  with particular reference to developing countries. ""An Agenda for Peace"" is a most constructive contribution to thinking about conflict-avoidance  conflict-management and conflict-reduction after the end of the cold war. The initiative on self-determination being pursued by the Government of Liechtenstein should provide support for  and assist in  the development of ideas contained in the report. Ongoing discussions concerning options for reform of the United Nations  including the High-Level Working Group set up by the Non-Aligned Movement  as well as many statements made in the current debate  are clearly intended to contribute to the same end. It is surely among the most promising signs of the times that we can talk of a global agenda at all - and that the global agenda should be for peace. The initiative which my Government proposes is intended to be  in effect  the economic counterpart to ""An Agenda for Peace"". Our aim is not to engage again in a general debate on development issues - although we have an obvious interest in continuing discussion of the nature  direction  pace and international environment for developmental change but to stimulate the exchange of practical ideas and experiences relevant to enhancing and increasing opportunities for economic participation for the benefit of people in developing countries. In short  the proposal is to seek support for the appointment of a panel of distinguished  expert and experienced persons to prepare a practical report based on experience in diverse countries and on a close  critical analysis of possible options for presentation to the United Nations. My Government's plan is to seek the support of fellow members of the South Pacific Forum and other regional groups to which we belong or with which  like the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  we have close and cordial relations  to raise the proposal for consideration by members of the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement  and to discuss it on a bilateral basis as widely as we can with a view to submitting a resolution to the Assembly at its forty-eighth session. We would hope to see a panel appointed in time to present a report during the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly  and to have it debated in 1995. Like many other countries represented in this Assembly  Papua New Guinea inherited many of its economic  legal and other arrangements from abroad. Many of the practices  policies and laws followed in the monetary sector of our national economy were originally devised in different conditions  by different people and to serve different objectives. We believe that we have not exhausted - or even considered all practical policy or legal options for facilitating economic participation by our citizens in either national or international affairs. We have not had ready and systematic access to experiences elsewhere. We do not believe that market forces on their own will necessarily allow our people adequate opportunities to participate in and benefit from economic development without further change.  Further options need to be identified and further changes will have to be made if people seeking to participate in economic development from the baseline at which most people in developing countries start are to be able to identify  utilize and benefit from the opportunities which are more often in theory than in practice available to them. We want to learn what the options are. My Government will  therefore  be looking to other Members of the United Nations for support and ideas to advance our proposal. The result will  we hope  be an important  practical guide to options for creating  maintaining  diversifying and/or enlarging opportunities for economic participation  with particular reference to developing countries. My Government has recently found itself being criticized  for the first time  before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and the Joint Assembly of the African  Caribbean and Pacific signatories of the Lome Convention and the European Economic Community over human rights abuses in the North Solomons Province of Papua New Guinea. It gives me no pleasure to say  even though it is true  that most of the abuses  for which parties on all sides of the conflict must accept some responsibility  occurred while a previous Government was in office  and that my colleagues and I opposed them at the time. As members of the present Government  we are now responsible for resolving the situation  whatever its causes. We must accept responsibility for what we decide or condone from now on. But the situation which gave rise to the criticism to which I have referred owes much to economic practices  policies and laws which were devised with little or no regard for popular participation  and with even less regard for the particular characteristics of the societies in which most of the people in the area continue to live. It also highlights the need to recognize that processes which might help alleviate tensions and reduce conflicts in some parts of the world might not have the same effects in others. They might  in fact  only make matters worse. For Papua New Guinea  as for many other developing countries which have become independent since the Second World War  nation-building remains a difficult problem and a pressing concern. The issue for us is not  as it is elsewhere  to find ways of managing ethnic and other tensions now that the ideological and technological weight of the cold war has been lifted from previously subject peoples  but rather to reconcile differences within and harness them to a common  national cause. Furthermore  my Government has taken the view that dealing with human rights on their own is often not to the point. It can  in fact  be irrelevant and can even actively contribute to further suffering. My Government has  therefore  admitted that wrongs have been committed by participants on all sides of the conflict in Papua New Guinea's North Solomons Province. It has taken steps to ensure that they cease and are not repeated and has invited other Governments and international organizations to help redress them by contributing  for example  to the costs of assessing needs  planning rehabilitation and restoring services to people who have suffered without them. My Government believes that Papua New Guineans are best placed to resolve the conflict; but we look to others for help in rehabilitating people  repairing damage and restoring services. My Government intends to be among the concerned participants in the second world conference on human rights  scheduled for June 1993. As was done at the tenth Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement  we reaffirm the universality of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms  which are embodied in the Papua New Guinea Constitution. But  like other members of the Non-Aligned Movement  we believe that economic and social progress facilitates the achievement of such rights and freedoms  which is why I have emphasized economic opportunity and participation. For similar reasons we welcome the broad scope proposed for the world conference on women in 1995  which focuses on action in the context of equality  development and peace. As an active participant in the work of the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly and the Committee of 24  my Government is a strong supporter of the International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism (1990-2000). We therefore look forward to hosting a Pacific regional seminar on decolonization in Port Moresby in 1993 in order to help further the plan of action for the Decade. In our immediate region  we continue to support United Nations involvement in the decolonization of New Caledonia and trust that the outcome of the forthcoming mid-term review of the implementation of the Matignon Accords will lead to further progress towards safeguarding the legitimate rights of the Kanaks. As far as other developments in the South Pacific are concerned  we welcome the French Government's decision to suspend its nuclear-weapon-testing programme in French Polynesia. We urge that it be ended for good. We look to the Government of the United States of America to honour President Bush's promise to limit the use of Johnston Atoll for disposing of weapons which were never directed at us while they were active but which now threaten our safety  health and economic welfare. We seek assurances that the Pacific Ocean will not be used to transport plutonium or other hazardous nuclear  chemical or biological materials which  might pollute the seas on which we rely. Promises that every precaution will be taken are simply not enough. Like the Governments of other South Pacific island countries  we are sympathetic to the aspirations of those who favour increased regional economic cooperation in Europe and North America. We support efforts to assist former communist States in the immense task of economic and social reconstruction which lies ahead. But  like the Governments of other developing countries  we in the South Pacific are concerned that regional integration and efforts to meet needs in other parts of the world should not proceed at the expense of the needs of our people. We are also concerned that the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) be brought to an early conclusion  with due regard for the need to secure and expand opportunities for the economic participation of developing countries in the international economy. It is  in fact  precisely because we believe that opportunities for economic participation should be greater and more equitably distributed than they have been that my Government has proposed the initiative I have previously outlined. My Government supports the active role being taken by the United Nations  in difficult circumstances  to ensure peace and to bring about a return to normalcy in Cambodia. We also support efforts to secure peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to facilitate relief efforts in Somalia. We are heartened by what we have heard from the Governments of Israel and neighbouring States concerning the prospects for a negotiated settlement of outstanding sources of conflict in the Middle East. We are cautiously hopeful about the prospects for a democratic  non-racial South Africa. But  as the situation now stands  my Government believes that it should maintain existing bans on all dealings with South Africa  continue to monitor developments there closely and consider relaxing those bans only as further progress occurs in the desired direction and in close consultation with African States. Like our predecessors  my Government supports efforts to limit the production and sale of arms. We believe that unwanted foreign military forces should be removed from countries which do not pose a threat to their neighbours or to international law. However  coming as I do from a developing country  I feel it important to repeat that we need to acknowledge the reality  recognized also in the report ""An Agenda for Peace""  that there are non-military threats to peace which are perhaps becoming more obvious than ever before. My Government agrees with the observation made in the report that there is a need to strengthen arrangements to identify  monitor  synthesize information about and act collectively to avert  reduce and limit such threats  with sensitivity to local circumstances  including the interests of well-intentioned States  and with full regard for international law. I cannot help noticing not only how the membership and the agenda of the General Assembly have changed in recent years but also how the content  tone and frankness with regard to domestic difficulties  and even the length of contributions to the general debate  have changed  and generally for the better.  As head of my country's delegation  I have had the privilege of listening to delegations from newly admitted Member States make use of the opportunity to participate in the General Assembly on their own account for the first time. I trust that other Governments will see fit to support my proposal for a United Nations-sponsored initiative to prepare and discuss a detailed report on how best to go about the task complementary to securing increased opportunities for political participation of securing increased opportunities for economic participation  with particular reference to needs in and of developing countries. Opportunity and participation are the keys to political development  security and peace. They are also the keys to economic development and justice  including equity between  and within  the northern and southern parts of the globe. "
"128",5682,"POL",47,1992,"Please accept my congratulations  Sir  on your election to the presidency of the current session of the General Assembly. I wish you every success in carrying out this responsible task. Let me also add how glad we are to have a President personifying the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern Europe. To the outgoing President  Ambassador Samir S. Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  I convey our appreciation for the quality of his leadership and work. I also want to assure the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  of our unfailing support for his tireless efforts to make the United Nations live up to the expectations of our time and to the law of the Charter. It is with profound satisfaction that we welcome in our midst the new Members of the United Nations: San Marino  Moldova  Kazakhstan  Armenia  Kyrgyzstan  Uzbekistan  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Azerbaijan and Georgia  as well as Croatia  Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The end of the cold war has opened up the possibility of building a world order free from nuclear terror based on mutual respect among nations  on greater equality of opportunity  and on effective cooperative structures. It has raised hopes for a safer  more equitable and more humane world. Yet we are still far from turning those hopes into reality. Consequently  the international community is led to re-examine and adjust the structures and functions of the United Nations. Member States are thinking more and more in terms of stimulating efforts to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Organization. In the words of the Secretary-General  they should seek the ""transfiguration of the house"". Our fiftieth anniversary will offer an appropriate occasion to reassess the structure of the Organization with a view to tapping the full potential of the Charter. Before we talk about its revision  we first need to re-read the Charter in an attempt to implement it consistently and to adapt its application to the post-cold-war realities and to the political and socio economic challenges originating form the South-North relationship.* Important suggestions have been made by the Secretary-General in his imaginative report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). We welcome this document and the proposals contained therein. International security is a multidimensional issue. While the military factor continues to play its key role  security and stability are becoming increasingly dependent on other factors as well. We are facing pressing tasks in the economic area: the economies of the developing countries and the economies of the newly democratic countries  which emerged with the fall of communism  must become more efficient. There are enormous challenges with regard to the protection of the environment  with regard to the refugee question  and with regard to natural and man-made disasters. The issue of refugees represents an external manifestation of problems which cannot be addressed effectively without first attending to their underlying causes. The dramatic plight of famine- stricken Somalia is a manifest example. It calls not only for urgent international relief but also for long-standing assistance. The advance made in arms control and in disarmament has a direct and positive impact on the international security climate. Over the last 12 months  negotiations in this vital area resulted  amongst other things  in the Open Skies Treaty  the agreements between the United States and the four successor States of the former USSR (Russia  Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan) relating to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)  and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development  Production  Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The Conference on Disarmament in Geneva must be commended for having finally reached an agreement to ban these abhorrent weapons. The States participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) have committed themselves to become original signatories to that important instrument. We urge all Member States to do likewise. However  arms control and disarmament are unfinished tasks. The United Nations has to deal with the overkill capacity still present in arsenals  both nuclear and conventional  and with the growing danger of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology. There is an immediate need to control international arms transfers. Openness and transparency in the military field have to be promoted. Military stability and confidence will be elusive unless we make headway in all these areas. But even that is not enough. International peace and security will at best remain fragile as long as prevailing patterns and practices are not redressed to eliminate the non-military causes of instability  including ethnic hatred and nationalism. The crisis in the former Yugoslavia  and especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina  stands out at present as the single greatest breach of international peace. It is a threat to the security of the region. Non-compliance with the law of armed conflict; the atrocities; persecution of various population groups  including forced resettlement and ""ethnic cleansing"" programmes; gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms; obstacles put in the way of humanitarian aid  including obstacles to the activity of the International Committee of the Red Cross - all these acts underlie a regional conflict of unprecedented proportions which is brimming with spill-over risks and incalculable conseguences. The recent report of Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki  Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights  contains stark evidence of breaches of international humanitarian law and human rights. The report leaves no party to the conflict blameless  while recognizing that the degrees of responsibility are far from being equal or even comparable. In view of the reports on civilian and prisoner-of-war detention camps  the Polish Government deems it necessary to reiterate its demand of 7 August this year that all such camps be closed down forthwith and all the detainees be released without delay. Moreover  criminal prosecution of all persons responsible for breaches of the law of armed conflict must be ensured. Poland has contributed one of the largest contingents to the United Nations Transition Authority in Cambodia and to the United Nations Protection Force in former Yugoslavia. At the same time/ Poland recognizes the urgent need of reassessment of the tasks and structure of United Nations peace-keeping forces  including - as proposed by the Secretary-General the establishment of a standing force at the disposal of the Organization. Another subject which deserves examination is the financing of the peace-keeping operations out of the defence budgets of States. The earmarking of merely half a per cent of their annual military expenditures for peace-keeping operations would help to overcome the present budgetary constraints. In this way  the maintenance of peace and security would become a truly common responsibility of the international community. Poland stands ready to contribute to the development of international centres for preparing peace-keeping forces. To this end we propose to make available to the United Nations one of the military bases in Poland vacated by the Russian armed forces. Let me also stress at this juncture that the Government of Poland has indicated its willingness to assign to peace-keeping operations  as of 1993  two or three self-contained infantry battalions  in addition to logistics detachments. This contingent could eventually be made available to the Security Council on a permanent basis. We thus fully agree with words that the President of the United States of America uses in his address to us yesterday namely  that a new emphasis should be put on peace-keeping. That idea has also been entertained by other speakers. Furthermore  in response to a recent suggestion by the Secretary-General  Poland stands ready to participate in consultations aimed at the implementation of Article 43 of the Charter. I shall now address the issue of regionalism. Some points have already been raised during today's debate. I am referring in particular to the statements by the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands. Member States should make more use of the opportunities inherent in Chapter VIII of the Charter. Regional and continental security structures should become  in our view  part of a global security architecture. The aggression against Kuwait and the hostilities in former Yugoslavia  in Moldova and in Nagorno-Karabakh have laid bare the strength of nationalism and the weakness of some regional structures. Indeed  left to fester  political  ethnic  religious and other conflicts have spread insecurity and instability across Europe and far beyond. While the United Nations is  as proved by the Persian Gulf experience  capable of playing its role in regard to the restoration and then preservation of peace and security  we still need to seek new security arrangements in keeping with the Charter. In Europe  this need has already been recognized by the North Atlantic Alliance  which is the pillar of security in our continent  the Western European Union and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Poland supports their involvement and active cooperation with other institutions in peace-keeping  conflict prevention and crisis management. Harmonious and constructive interaction between the United Nations and regional organizations or arrangements may well constitute an important new element in making the United Nations more effective in the field of peace and security. This fact is rightly emphasized by the Secretary-General in his report. In crisis situations  where several organizations are acting simultaneously  it could be advisable to set up  on an ad-hoc basis  a single coordinating framework. This would help to avoid duplication  overlapping or dissipation of efforts. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should be commended for its offer of such cooperation. It declared itself a regional arrangement in the sense of Chapter VIII of the Charter. This implies the establishment of an important link between European and global security. In our concern for peace and security we must consider the non-military factors. Let me turn first to human rights  an area where the Polish nation has accumulated considerable experience of internal struggle for the respect of the individual. Our debate on this issue is taking place at a time of both rising expectations and mounting fears about future developments. The international community is frustrated by its far-too-frequent helplessness in cases of grave and massive violations of human rights. Former Yugoslavia is a recent case in point.  The United Nations should urgently consider additional measures to address serious violations of human rights among other things  a system of enforcement of respect for human rights. In this connection  the Austrian proposal concerning the establishment of a human rights emergency mechanism  submitted to the Commission on Human Rights  deserves proper attention.  The forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights is an appropriate forum to discuss these questions. The Conference should adopt a comprehensive approach to human rights. It should elaborate an action-oriented programme for the promotion and implementation of human rights as well as for the prevention of their violation. It should contribute to improving the coordination of United Nations activities in that respect. The framework for the preparations for the Conference is provided by General Assembly resolution 45/155. While noting the variety of factors which influence the status of human rights  the resolution places emphasis on their universality. There is no justification for any differentiation in understanding the contents and the meaning of human rights  nor is there any room for their selective application. We must do all in our power to prevent the weakening of the universal substance of human rights. My country pays particular attention to the protection of minorities. This attitude has found its expression in the treaties concluded by Poland with its neighbours. We fully endorse the adoption by the General Assembly of the draft declaration on the rights of persons belonging to national  ethnic  religious and linguistic minorities. While the ideologically motivated East-West division no longer exists and we rejoice at that we now see a growing North-South division  with the countries in transition  such as Poland  stranded in between. As a result  the promise of peace  greater security and freedom for all is being slowly eroded. Global inequality  exemplified by the widening gap between the rich North and the poor South as well as the disparity in access to markets  must be alleviated not only for economic  but also for security  humanitarian and ethical reasons. Ecologically sustainable development  with democracy and the market economy at its core  should be the focal point and the principal goal of the United Nations system as it prepares itself for the future: the year 2000 and beyond. We shall not be able to cope successfully with the challenges ahead unless a coalition for development is forged. As it happens  there are also grounds to fear a division based on the level of economic development in Europe. In the case of countries in transition  their long-awaited prosperity is lagging behind  not coming hand-in-hand with freedom. The Western industrial democracies have not yet adopted a coherent approach to the emerging problems of countries in Central and Eastern Europe. A grand strategy for supporting the democratic transition has not yet been worked out  a strategy whose relevance  I dare say  may well one day be highly appreciated in other regions and countries likely to face transition and transformation problems. There is little doubt that international economic relations need to be reformed in the overriding interest of international stability and security. The stronger the economy  the sturdier the political and social fabric of States and  in effect  the greater their resistance to the impact of ethnic conflicts  refugee exoduses and migration problems. This  I believe  is a valid argument in favour of accelerated restructuring of the economies in transition and their early integration into the world economy. The social implications of economic reform and structural adjustment need to be carefully monitored  both in the developing countries and in those in transition. We expect that the forthcoming United Nations Summit Conference on social policies and development will address these implications in some detail  especially as they relate to Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. It would certainly be helpful if  in the course of preparations for the conference  the Secretary-General could prepare  by analogy with his report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  a report on the challenges of social and economic development. Poland welcomes the fact that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  held in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year  has opened a new chapter of international cooperation by addressing environmental protection issues in a manner compatible with the requirements of sustainable development. The Decade of International Law has got off to a slow start  yet it still offers a unique framework for enhancing the role of law as the basic factor for order in international relations. We should not miss this opportunity. The United Nations itself is facing a number of legal questions of a highly sensitive nature: Let me refer  by way of example  to the contemporary meaning of sovereignty; the rule of law and domestic jurisdiction of States; respect for international law in conflict situations; global legal mechanisms for the enforcement of human rights; the establishment of an international criminal court; succession of States; and international compensation claims. As to the solution of conflicts  recourse should be made to Article 36 of the Charter. Security Council recommendations on specific procedures or methods of adjustment of disputes should become a normal practice in cases where parties to a dispute are unable to settle it in accordance with their obligations under paragraph 3 of Article 2. Poland is in favour  in particular  of reinforcing the role of the International Court of Justice. I wish to conclude by noting that enduring world peace is inconceivable without law and justice standing out as unfaltering beacons for all men and nations alike."
"129",5708,"PRK",47,1992,"On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  I would like to congratulate you  Mr. Ganev  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. It is my conviction that under your able leadership this session will come to a fruitful conclusion. I would like also to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the efforts made over the past year by His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali in carrying out his heavy responsibilities as Secretary-General  to ensure world peace and security and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in line with changes in the international situation. The end of the cold war that had persisted ever since the end of the Second World War brought with it great changes in the recent international situation. In this vortex of change in the international situation  the phase of detente is beginning in North-East Asia. Recent events on the Korean peninsula are attracting world attention. Dialogue between the north and the south on many levels is under way to end the distrust and confrontation resulting from prolonged national division. In particular  the north-south high-level talks have resulted in the adoption of the Agreement on Reconciliation  Non-Aggression  Cooperation and Exchanges. This is a great victory in the nationwide struggle to bring about the three principles of national reunification: independence  peaceful reunification and great national unity. It is a new  historic milestone on the road to national reunification. The north-south Agreement and the north-south Joint Statement of 4 July constitute a programme for national reunification that reflects the aspirations of the Korean nation to reunification and the current trends towards peace. In the north-south Agreement  the north and the south make it clear that relations between the two sides are not inter-State relations but rather special relations formed provisionally in the process of moving towards reunification. In the Agreement  the north and the south also pledge to recognize and respect each other's systems and to refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs. This Agreement shows that both the north and the south want a single unified State  not ""two States""  and look to achieve reunification along the lines of confederation. Reunification through confederation based on one nation  one State  two systems and two Governments has become a realistic goal. It is an issue which can no longer be avoided both in view of the present trend of the international situation which is moving towards rapprochement  detente and the end of confrontation and in the light of the specific conditions on the Korean peninsula where two different ideas and systems exist. The highlight of our proposal for reunification through confederation is that the north and south form a unified national Government to be represented by the north and the south on an equal basis under which the north and the south exercise regional autonomy with equal rights and power. It will be the most peaceful and ideal method of reunification. It will form a single State by uniting the two autonomous governments  maintaining the two systems intact. And it will be based on the principle of coexistence with neither side conquering or overpowering or being conquered or being overpowered. This proposal for confederation  acceptable to both sides during dialogue  is now turning from possibility to feasibility. The recent 8th North-South High Level Talks in Pyongyang have led to the functioning of joint committees for the implementation of the Agreement in different areas such as political  military  economic  social and cultural. It is true that the north-south dialogue for implementing the Agreement is confronted with a series of obstacles and difficulties because the feelings of distrust and confrontation conceived during the long period of the division still remain. However  we are optimistic about the prospect of north-south dialogue and reunification. Blood is thicker than water. The homogeneous nationhood of the Korean people surpasses the differences of the systems and ideas of the north and south. Our people  with their strong sense of national independence  have good traditions and experiences of having achieved unity for the common cause of the nation  transcending the differences of ideas  political views and religious beliefs. The Government of our Republic will exert all its efforts to follow through the already-begun reunification process in order to reach the final point of reunification by reviving such national traditions. We will also do our best to resolve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula at an early date in the interest of peace and reunification of Korea  as agreed upon by the north and the south in the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the nuclear suspicion that remains unresolved stem from the deployment of United States nuclear weapons in south Korea. Therefore  fundamental to resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is the withdrawal of United States nuclear weapons from South Korea and the removal of the serious apprehension of our nation which has been under a nuclear threat during the last 30 years. To this end  it is urgent to adopt an agreement and regulations of inspection under the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to inspect the United States nuclear weapons and bases in south Korea. The North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee  although it has met several times  has not yet adopted the regulations of inspection to verify the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula nor has it carried out any inspection of the United States nuclear weapons and bases in south Korea. This is due to the fact that the south Korean authorities are not in a position to exercise their sovereign right regarding the question of United States nuclear weapons and bases. This situation  we believe  has prevented the North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee from arriving at an agreement to include the United States nuclear weapons and bases in the scope of the parameters for inspection. Quite recently  it was revealed that United States nuclear weapons have been stockpiled in the secret nuclear storage in south Korea and a naval base in Jinhae  south Korea  also serves as a United States nuclear submarine base. This causes a great number of people to have suspicion about the sincerity of the announcement of the non-existence of United States nuclear weapons in south Korea. It is most deplorable that the south Korean authorities do not have a say on the presence of nuclear weapons from other countries which are now on their own soil nor can they verify the withdrawal of these nuclear weapons. As far as we are concerned  we have declared time and time again that we have no nuclear weapons  nor any intention or capacity to make them. We have no need to produce them. It is our firm will  in line with our invariable anti-nuclear peace policy  to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes and not to develop nuclear weapons. The honesty of the peaceful nuclear policy of the Government of our Republic and the will for denuclearization have already been proved by several ad hoc inspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The so-called suspicion of our ""nuclear development"" is fading away. We do what we say and we never say empty words. If the south Korean authorities are really concerned about the ""future"" of the Korean peninsula and interested in realizing its denuclearization  they should take an independent stand free from outside forces and respond as soon as possible to adopting the regulations of inspection  so that the overall inspection of United States nuclear weapons and bases could be carried out as agreed upon by the north and the south. The reunification of the Korean peninsula presupposes the eradication of the legacy of the cold war and the termination of foreign interference. The Korean question has been closely related to international relations historically. The division of Korea was brought about not by the internal contradictions of our nation but was imposed on it against its will to serve only the interests of foreign forces. It is foreign forces that impede the ongoing north-south talks. Consequently  the key issue in realizing the reunification of the Korean peninsula today is to end foreign interference in the Korean question. The presence of United States troops in south Korea is clear evidence of interference by a foreign force impeding the solution to the Korean question. During the cold-war era the presence of foreign armed forces in other countries was ""justified"" under the pretext of preserving the so-called balance of forces. However  this argument no longer holds today since the cold war ended and power politics have become meaningless. There is no justification whatsoever for the continued presence of United States forces in south Korea. On the Korean peninsula  the north and the south have pledged themselves to non-aggression through the Agreement and have formed the joint military commission to deal with military affairs. Nevertheless  the United States is still pursuing a policy of ""power politics"" based on the cold-war way of thinking. The United States continues to ""justify"" the stationing of its armed forces in south Korea with the new argument that a ""power vacuum"" could be created. It is contradictory to claim  according to one's interest  that on some occasions peace has come to the world and on other occasions to divide the world into friends and enemies  talking about a ""power vacuum"". The United States must drop its policy of power towards the Korean peninsula and withdraw its troops from south Korea  thereby fulfilling its responsibility in helping to achieve peace and the reunification of Korea. In today's world - which stands at the crossroads of independence or domination  peace or war  cooperation or division the peace  security and reunification of the Korean peninsula become one of the most urgent questions  the solution of which brooks no further delay. The problem of Korea's reunification is a touchstone. Whether or not it is solved will clarify whether international society is entering a stage of independent  peaceful and democratic development or still remains in the era of domination and subjugation  conflict and confrontation. It is our hope that Korea's reunification will be realized through confederation on the basis of the three principles of independence  peaceful reunification and great national unity which the north and south have already announced with full commitment  thus showing one part of the genuine development of international society. Humankind is now at a historical turning-point for opposing domination and subjugation and building a new  free and peaceful world. Such aspirations of humankind  however  are still being gravely challenged by the old forces that pursue power politics. Despite the collapse of the cold-war structure characterized by confrontation between the super-Powers  there are new  open attempts to capitalize on this situation in order to establish world domination. If such attempts are allowed to go unchecked  the world will change from the cold-war structure of a bipolar system to the hegemonistic structure of a unipolar system and the democratic development of international society will suffer yet another setback. Therefore  today's era can brook no further delay in establishing a new  just international order to replace the old international order under which a few countries go unchallenged and freely dominate the destiny of humankind. There are big and small countries in the world  but there cannot be senior or junior countries; there are developed and less developed nations  but there cannot be dominating nations and nations destined to be dominated. All countries and nations are entitled to independent and equal rights as equal members of international society  regardless of the size of their territories or level of development. Neither privileges nor arbitrariness should be tolerated in international relations  and friendship and cooperation among countries should be developed positively on the principle of mutual respect  non-interference  equality and mutual benefit. It is the expectation of the people of the world that the United Nations  under the changed situation today  will play a pivotal role in securing peace and achieving the common prosperity of mankind by fulfilling its mission as the international organization to safeguard world peace and justice. At the recent tenth summit conference of non-aligned countries  the Heads of State and Government were unanimous in their emphasis on the necessity of strengthening the role of the United Nations in safeguarding world peace and security and in establishing an equitable international order. The United Nations should pay careful attention to bringing about disarmament and the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons  in keeping with the present situation in which the cold war has come to an end. Mankind can neither get rid of the danger of nuclear war  nor expect true peace  so long as the arms race continues unbridled and nuclear weapons remain. We hold that a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests should be concluded as soon as possible. Testing and production of nuclear weapons should be stopped  and nuclear weapons should be abolished once and for all. The prevention of the emergence of any new nuclear Power is another important issue in settling the nuclear problem. In this connection  we could not but express our concern that  despite world condemnation  Japan is storing more nuclear fuel than it needs  and is even carrying out an adventurous plan involving the marine transportation of plutonium. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will in the future  as in the past  make positive efforts to abolish nuclear weapons  biological and chemical weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction on the globe. The United Nations should pay particular attention to the economic issue  one of the important problems in establishing a new international order at present  and endeavour to eliminate the ever-widening gap between the developed and the developing countries. People in many developing countries are enduring great suffering from famine and disease. Anyone who feels responsibility for the survival and future of mankind cannot turn away from such tragedies occurring in the world. It is the most urgent common task of mankind at present to spare the peoples of the developing countries the calamities of famine and disease. The developed countries should feel due responsibility for the economic poverty of the developing countries  and should refrain from hindering the economic development of the developing countries. In this regard  the Government of our Republic holds that dialogue between the developed and the developing countries should be resumed at the earliest possible date  the present unequal international economic relations should be restructured  and constructive measures should be taken for the establishment of a new equitable international economic order. Along with this  the developing countries should take practical measures to achieve South-South cooperation  starting with the spheres of food  agriculture and public health  which will be indispensable in eradicating famine and disease. The United Nations should also continue to concentrate on the peaceful solution of regional disputes and the elimination of all kinds of interference in internal affairs and unjust pressure. Today  when the confrontational structure between the super-Powers has collapsed and new  many-sided international relations are emerging  ethnic  national and racial contradictions which have long been obscured behind the cold war are rapidly surfacing with increased intensity  thus triggering new regional conflicts. These constitute elements of instability  which will complicate regional situations and cause serious damage to world peace and security. Urgent measures should be taken to settle the problems of regional disputes peacefully through dialogue  negotiations and political coordination. All countries and nations are entitled to decide freely on their own political and economic systems and development on the basis of respect for the principles of national sovereignty  the right to self-determination  and non-interference in internal affairs. We should not allow any attempts to infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries  to interfere in their internal affairs and to impose unfair blockades and pressure. Human rights should no longer be used as leverage for political pressure against and interference in the developing countries. We take this opportunity to extend our unqualified support for and solidarity with the struggle of the peoples in Asia  Africa  Latin America and the rest of the world to safeguard national independence and sovereignty and achieve independent national development  particularly the struggle of the Cambodian people under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk to restore peace and national unity and the status of a sovereign State; the struggle of the Palestinian and other Arab peoples for a fair solution to the Middle East question  centred on the Palestinian question; the struggle of the South African people to end the policy of apartheid and attain their country's democratic development; and the struggle of the Cuban people to defend their sovereignty against all kinds of foreign pressure and interference. The Government of our Republic recognizes that the United Nations should democratize itself as soon as possible in order to fulfil its responsibilities and roles in establishing a new world order. Before anything else is done  the United Nations should be restructured and reformed to develop international relations on a new democratic basis. The restructuring of the United Nations is indispensable  inasmuch as it will enable the world body to perform efficiently its main mission as an international organization safeguarding world peace and justice by dynamically coping with a changed reality and new challenges. To this end  the United Nations should be democratized on the principle of ensuring independence  equality and justice for all Member States and never tolerating privileges within the United Nations. Independence  equality and justice are  indeed  strong binding forces that have enabled more than 100 countries on this planet to join in one community  the United Nations  irrespective of differences in ideologies and systems and the gap between the rich and the poor. In order to realize the democratization of the United Nations and to ensure its impartiality in line with the present changing international situation  the privileged positions of a few countries should no longer be permitted in the United Nations. The relations between the Security Council  the General Assembly and the Secretary-General should be reorganized with a view to strengthening the United Nations. In particular  the Security Council should not infringe the supreme authority of the General Assembly. In this regard  we believe that special attention should be paid to the problem of the composition of the Security Council. However  we consider that a country that still fails to feel any responsibility for aggression and war crimes committed during the Second World War is not qualified to become a permanent member of the Security Council  even if the number of the Council's permanent members is to be increased. One of the most important problems in democratizing the United Nations is to eliminate the leftover inequities of the cold war. The United Nations Command  a legacy of the cold-war era  still remains on the Korean peninsula. It is indeed astonishing and surprising that these ""United Nations forces"" -which are not under the command of the United Nations and over which the United Nations cannot exercise any authority still exist in this world. The United Nations should no longer deeply disappoint Member States with the sense that its authority is applied selectively  depending on which State is involved. The United Nations should live up to the expectations of Member States in terms of its impartial and sincere image by eradicating all unjust and contradictory remnants of the cold war. Our delegation attaches great importance to this forty-seventh session of the General Assembly and will exert every effort to ensure its success. What is important in ensuring world peace and security and in strengthening international cooperation is to further enhance the responsibility and role of States Members of the United Nations. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will actively contribute to building a prosperous  peaceful and free new world by faithfully fulfilling its obligations as a State Member of the United Nations at this historic turning-point in the achievement of a durable peace and security in the world. "
"130",5753,"PRT",47,1992,"At the outset  I should like to congratulate the President and the Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly on their respective election. I am certain that their recognized personal qualities guarantee  in the eyes of all those present  an outstanding stewardship of our work. I thank the outgoing President  Ambassador Samir Shihabi  for the dedication he showed throughout the last session of the General Assembly  thereby contributing to the consolidation of the process leading to the reform of the Assembly.  I also address the Secretary-General  under whose aegis it has already been possible to take concrete and decisive steps towards a thorough reform of the Organization and the restructuring of the Secretariat along more flexible and operational lines. My Government appreciates that initiative and gives it its full support. Portugal views ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) in that light. As was made clear by the British Foreign Secretary Mr. Douglas Hurd  who spoke this morning on behalf of the European Community and its member States  we believe that the proposals presented by Mr. Boutros-Ghali deserve special attention. It fell to Portugal to preside over the European Community Council of Ministers during a period of turmoil in recent history. Everywhere traditional alignments are disappearing. Regimes which until recently were held to be unchangeable are giving way to new institutions  oriented towards the defence of human dignity and democratic pluralism. The legacy of several decades has been shaken up in a few short years. During the first half of 1992 the Portuguese Presidency of the Council sought to promote a greater opening of the Community to the outside. I do not speak merely of enlargement and political dialogue; I speak of modalities of cooperation and assistance and the presentation of constructive proposals to deal with important issues in international economic relations. I also speak of the incentives for regional integration throughout the world. Furthermore  the external activity of the European Community did not ignore crisis situations. In this respect  the conflict involving several republics of the former Yugoslavia stands out. Priority was given to the involvement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution to that grave crisis. We sought from the beginning to generate synergism between the efforts of the European Community and the action of the Secretary-General and the Security Council. I believe that the degree achieved  both at the level of the decision-making bodies of the two organizations and in the field  where European Community monitors and United Nations peace-keeping forces are deployed  is extremely positive. I am certain that it will have to continue to be so. I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate Portugal's full agreement with the principles and measures defined at the recent London Conference. They are the basis for a negotiated settlement of the problems of the former Yugoslavia. We support the peace process that was relaunched on that occasion under the experienced guidance of Lord Owen and Mr. Cyrus Vance. The foundation of that process consists of work already done in the framework of the Conference presided over by Lord Carrington  to whom I am grateful for his competence and dedication. Lastly  I must pay tribute  for the tasks they have performed  under circumstances of extreme hardship  even involving the sacrifice of their own lives  to the members of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  in which Portugal has the privilege of participating  the European Community monitoring mission and all the humanitarian agencies involved. I have been emphasizing that the road to progress is built on a sharing of responsibility by various actors in the international community. It was in that light that Lisbon hosted last May the Conference on assistance to the newly independent States. Following the first Conference on that subject  the Washington Conference  we sought to give an answer to the challenges presented by the collapse of the Soviet Union  an event which I then considered to be among the most significant of the century. Aware of the obstacles to be overcome  the participating countries agreed to lend their support to structural programmes of assistance and economic cooperation in a macroeconomic sense. Such actions would complement and not duplicate the programmes being implemented by several financial institutions. As for the political side of the Conference  it was restated that the new States must try to develop progressively a regional form of cooperation reflecting the mutual dependence that exists in so many vital sectors. To that aim we must add the demand for full respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the commitments of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Such conduct is essential for continued assistance and the process of democratic reform. We are witnessing events of great scope and significance in other parts of the world. The Middle East peace process exhibits a new and encouraging vitality which must be fostered by all. There are no viable alternatives to that process  which was initiated in Madrid. Portugal  like its partners in the Community  considers that any just  lasting and comprehensive settlement of the question of the Middle East must be based upon Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). That belief was reiterated in June  together with a message of hope from the European Community Council meeting in Lisbon. It is now reinforced by the new policies of the Israeli Government  and it will be further strengthened by gestures of reciprocity from the Arab Governments. We have always advocated the presence of the United Nations in the peace process  commensurate with the importance of its role in international politics in general and the Middle East in particular.  Security and stability in the Mediterranean are vital strategic factors for Europe  especially for those States that  like ours  are close neighbours of that region. In this regard  the Maghreb is particularly relevant for us. Geographical proximity  a common history and close ties justify the genuine concern with which we have followed the political  social and economic problems the Maghreb is experiencing. We are aware that their effects threaten a delicate balance and the well-being of its populations. For these reasons  the European Community is committed to strengthening regional solidarity and establishing innovative forms of dialogue and cooperation reflecting the aims of partnership that motivate both sides. The Lisbon meeting of the European Community Council confirmed this view of the future in a clear Declaration which will renew the ties between the European Community and the Maghreb in all fields. Though an Atlantic country  Portugal does not forsake its Mediterranean heritage. Portugal devotes special attention to Africa. We follow with expectancy and optimism the processes of reconciliation and democratization under way throughout southern Africa. In Angola the day of the long-awaited general elections is nearing. In spite of the structural and logistical difficulties  I am certain that  whatever the outcome  the Angolan people will find their way towards a pluralistic and tolerant society  whose foundations will be the nation's enormous potential and its human and natural resources. Turning to Mozambique  Portugal gladly welcomes the recent meeting between President Chissano and Mr. Afonso Dhlkama  President of RENAMO. Mutual trust and open dialogue are  and will continue to be  decisive for an irreversible advance of the Mozambican peace process. We therefore hope that the spirit of Rome will remain alive among all the participants. Everything indicates that the United Nations will play a preponderant role in the subsequent stages of the process. In the wake of the success of the United Nations involvement in Angola  I appeal to the Organization to give the attention  the means and the resources needed so that Mozambique in its turn  in the near future  may reach peace  democracy and long-sought economic progress. As for South Africa  a country which is vital to regional stability  Portugal has maintained close contacts with its major political forces  urging them to engage in dialogue and practise tolerance. A drastic reduction in social tension and the resumption of talks in the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) are an absolute priority which we must pursue so as to eradicate the structural causes of a decades-old conflict. Portugal wholeheartedly supports the sending of United Nations  European Community and Organization of African Unity observers to South Africa. These observers may play a significant role. We see no credible alternative to this concerted effort. We have sought to encourage the dialogue between Europe and Latin America in this period of noteworthy development and regional integration initiatives. In this respect I should like to emphasize the significance of the Eighth Ministerial Meeting of the San Jose countries  held in Lisbon  and the Second Institutionalized Ministerial Meeting of the Rio Group  held in Santiago. At both meetings  new forms of cooperation were established agreement on the promotion of human rights at the first and on greater involvement of the European Investment Bank in programmes for the development of the South American continent at the second. Man is the reason for all our efforts. His dignity is  after all  our guiding universal value. Thus it is not legitimate to allow the collapse of Governments  civil wars or adverse natural conditions to jeopardize human lives and render mere survival a daily battle. Portugal associates itself with the efforts under way to ease the suffering of the civilian population of Somalia  a crisis which is constantly in our minds. Despite all the actions carried out by the international community  a solution to this tragedy is yet to be found. Situations such as these must be faced and dealt with in a different way. Relief for the afflicted populations comes before any local political conditionalities and cannot be subject to any preconditions or distortions whatsoever in it's distribution. There is clearly a need for preventive action by the United Nations  making available the necessary humanitarian aid and peace-keeping forces in the early stages of crises whenever possible.  The defence of each individual's dignity  an aim which must guide us at all times  has been the leitmotif of my statement as the representative of Portugal. The universal and indivisible nature of human rights is a principle which deserves general acceptance. Portugal maintains that condemnation of any violations of such rights can no longer be considered to be interference in the internal affairs of a State. We believe that the observance of the main international covenants is a fundamental condition for peace and progress. In this respect  we state unequivocally that there is a direct link between human rights  democracy and development; that is  development aid  in order to be productive and therefore justifiable presupposes the practice of democracy and fundamental freedoms at the receiving end. We still have a long way to go. I should like once more to alert the international community to the situation in East Timor  a Non-Self-Governing Territory under Portuguese authority illegally occupied by Indonesia  in violation of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. We all recall the tragic events that took place in Dili's Santa Cruz cemetery on 12 November 1991  which rightly received universal condemnation. When faced with unprecedented criticism  the Indonesian Government made promises  set up committees of inquiry  offered condolences and subscribed to a consensus statement of the Commission on Human Rights. Nevertheless  it refused to accept any inquiry under international supervision which could shed light on what had happened and clarify the circumstances which made it possible. The subsequently released report of the inquiry that did take place did little in this respect. On the other hand  heavy prison sentences including a life term were given to survivors of the killing  not indicted for violent activities  while the military personnel involved in the shooting were charged with mere disciplinary offences and given purely token prison terms. All of this contradicted the undertaking in the Commission on Human Rights  as the Sub-commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities recently recognized in a resolution adopted for the first time by an absolute majority. To avoid the repetition of massacres and other grave violations of human rights  we must address the true causes of this situation and initiate a new stage of consideration of the issue. Portugal  in its capacity as administering Power recognized by the United Nations  presented to the Secretary-General last January a proposal for a dialogue  without preconditions and under his auspices  with Indonesia and all the parties directly involved. The objective is a just  comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution  with full respect for the legitimate interests of the East Timorese people  including the right to self-determination  in conformity with the principles of the Charter and international law. To that end  we have spared no effort and look forward to hearing the results of the Secretary-General's initiative when  in the next few days in New York  he will host an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Portugal and Indonesia. In conclusion  I recall that a year ago I exhorted all States Members of the Organization to work together to achieve the essential aims of the Charter. The responsibilities placed upon my Government in the course of 1992 have given us a clearer perception of the nature of the arduous tasks before us. It is our duty to correct history's errors towards man  guided by legal and  above all  ethical principles  so that future generations may remember us through a legacy of justice and peace. "
"131",5799,"PRY",47,1992,"First of all  permit me to express to you. Sir  my congratulations and best wishes on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly in its work at the forty-seventh session. We are sure that under your intelligent guidance  our endeavours will achieve the results we all desire. Also at the outset  allow me to extend to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  cordial greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Paraguay  and to express our commitment to support him at all times in the difficult task of leading this Organization in its efforts for peace and international security. In welcoming the admission to membership of the United Nations of Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan  we hail the triumph of freedom and of mankind's universal desire to live in peace and democracy  while retaining the individual's own identity. Ancient banners have come to wave proudly again over their homelands. A new order is emerging in our universe. On the one hand  we see the rebirth of old nationalisms. On the other  we see plans for the integration of countries which are seeking  by this means  the right direction for achieving better economic development and trying to find  as in the case of the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)  the proper response to the requirements of their peoples for a better quality of life. The integration of our countries Argentina  Brazil  Uruguay and Paraguay through MERCOSUR is something more than a mere strategy for development: it is a commitment of peoples with the same origin  with common cultural  historical  linguistic and religious identities  to share the common destiny of nations that were born in a territory of equality and hope. The timetable for our fledgling integration process is being met. The Las Leilas meeting of Presidents on 26 and 27 June 1992 approved and is implementing a programme of measures which sets out a process of alleviating and eliminating customs duties and non-tariff barriers and of requiring the gradual coordination of macroeconomic and sectoral policies. The recent signing of an agreement with the European Community is an important element of extraregional cooperation for MERCOSUR. As part of this same commitment to integration  Paraguay is moving ahead with the necessary legal instruments for making better uses of the Paraguay-Paran waterway. This communications link  which has the support of the Organization and other international communities  is designed to be one of the major river transport routes and an effective instrument for development by the MERCOSUR countries and our sister Republic of Bolivia. The danger of a nuclear conflagration that would jeopardize the very existence of mankind has disappeared. Common sense and moral values have prevailed. Today there are very few cases of armed confrontation in the world. Never  perhaps  in its history has mankind enjoyed so much peace as now. But history has not come to an end: hunger  disease  lack of education  intolerance and prejudice continue to affect most parts of the world. If we love liberty  if we love democracy  we must find a solution to these problems. No state of politics can endure when people do not have the minimum they need for a life of dignity. If there is no tolerance  there will be hatred and resentment. If there is no education  the future of the world cannot be certain. Now is the time for continental solidarity. Now is the time for doing away with prejudices and egoism. Now that the arms race is over  it would seem that the most powerful countries are preparing for another war  the economic war. Alliances are forming; they are trying to improve their competitiveness. The winner will be the one who produces and sells the most  without regard to the social cost  without regard to the fact that the products of the less developed countries are constantly losing value and that as a result it is more and more difficult for them to achieve development. The expectations the developing countries had for free trade are being blocked by the barriers of protectionism set up by the industrialized countries  which  paradoxically  are proclaiming the triumph of the free market. We need to .seek solutions that will alleviate the tragedy of the countries suffering the scourge of poverty. We are confident that  thanks to the welcome initiative of Chile in calling for the holding of a summit conference for social development  this will be a suitable opportunity for achieving world planning to promote the development of the poorest countries. The hatred  the intolerance and the constant violation of human rights in former Yugoslavia  particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina  and in Somalia remind us that the battle for peace has not ended. Peace is a gift  and its preservation requires constant work. Paraguay will support in the strongest possible terms any action by the Security Council designed to seek a final solution to this grave situation  as indeed we voted in favour of resolution 46/242 of the General Assembly. Exacerbated nationalisms  racisms  religious hatreds and prejudices must disappear from the world if it wants to be more fraternal and humane. We are regarding with particular interest the continuation of negotiations to find a final solution to the Palestine question. It is our hope that these talks will contribute positively towards finding a peaceful and negotiated  final and lasting solution which would provide  as we have already said  for the right of the State of Israel to live in peace within its own borders and the right of the Palestinian people to its own homeland. The United Nations has lent its assistance to the peace process in South Africa through the Security Council. It is now up to the Government and the opposition to find appropriate solutions which provide  courageously and realistically  for the possibility of coexistence in a climate of peace  justice and security. As the United Nations enters the new world order that is the fruit of East-West detente  its structure and agenda must be reorganized. Social development and the maintenance of peace must be its major concerns. It will be vital for it to find appropriate machinery to fulfil these aims  and for it to have the unreserved support of those who can provide their decisive cooperation.  The ""Agenda for Peace"" proposed by the Secretary-General deserves all our support: it could be the starting point for the search for new structures and new paths towards lasting and constructive peace. We believe  along with the Rio Group  that international peace and security will be truly guaranteed only in so far as the underlying causes of conflicts are eliminated. We therefore reaffirm the vital importance of economic and social development in the process of consolidating peace. The gap reflected in the disparity in wealth between the North and the South must be narrowed if we want to avoid a chain reaction of unsatisfied needs leading to profound crises in developing countries  with the danger of returning to systems which we have abandoned and which have caused our peoples so much suffering. We cannot talk about a future of peace or of sustained development without total respect for human rights. The dissemination of these rights and their constant observance is also a task for the United Nations. Respect for human rights must underpin any process of change. Hence  we welcome the World Conference on Human Rights  to be held in June 1993 in Vienna  and are pleased at the timeliness of its convening. Flagrant violations of human rights  such as terrorism  still persist. Once and for all we must accept that terrorism is on of the most serious violations  attacking as it does fundamental human rights such as the rights to life  security and patrimony. Just a few days ago  in this very Hall  we were moved by the words of the President of Colombia about the battle being waged by his people and Government against drug trafficking. Murder  extortion  kidnapping and corruption all have their - roots in the traffic in drugs. Magistrates  civil servants and anyone opposed to this criminal traffic are under constant threat  and many have paid for their ideals  their courage and their dignity with their lives. We agree with stress laid by the President of Colombia on the responsibility of the major consuming centres  and on countries' obligation to participate in a total war against drug trafficking. As the President said  we must have determined  collective international and multilateral action to combat this scourge on all fronts. Five hundred years ago  the imagination and daring of Columbus ushered in a new era. America  a continent of hope  was incorporated into the adventure of mankind  and it was destined to have a profound effect on the future. Today  as a coincidence  the world is entering into a new stage that is also promising and full of hope. It is for this generation to consolidate the future  and for our Organization to ensure that there is peace and to promote social development. To mark the quincentenary  the countries of Ibero-America met last year in Guadalajara  Mexico  determined to make the strength of our community count in the future. The response was positive  and at the second summit of Heads of State and of Government of Ibero-America  held this year in Madrid  effective projects designed to help the Ibero-American peoples were approved. Joint efforts such as those we have mentioned and those promised in the Americas Initiative  as well as the solidarity and support that my country has received from other countries such as Japan and Germany  give us hope for a future of concerted effort for the development of those who need it most. In the course of this year  my country attended the Earth Summit in Rio  eager to add its efforts to those of the other countries committed to preserving the environment. We announced measures adopted in this area  such as the declaration as a protected ecological zone of an area covering about 60 000 hectares of woods  with an indigenous population and natural fauna. But what is more  we are currently studying a draft project for the development of the western region of my country  with the support of the European Community  paying particular attention to the preservation of the environment in an area of more than 240 000 square kilometres  which represents more than half of our territory. The Rio Conference made it possible for the whole world to become more aware of the relationship between development and the environment. It will be difficult to achieve lasting success in the endeavour of bringing about sustainable development of the Earth if the countries that bear the major responsibility for polluting the planet do not make available the necessary resources. The process of democratization in Latin America in this new era was  in a sense  what triggered the liberation movements in other parts of the world. Today  in America  with a few exceptions. Governments enjoy a legitimacy conferred upon them by free and unchallenged elections. The last flickers of violence are dying out  and peoples are living in freedom and democracy  with respect for human rights. The civil war in El Salvador is now history. That country  together with Honduras  has set an example for the international community by taking its international conflicts to the International Court of Justice for settlement. Peru is once again taking the path of restoring its constitution. In November  it will be holding constituent elections with the participation  at its request  of an observer mission from the Organization of American States. We hope that Peru will find solutions to the grave problems it is confronting and that we will shortly be able to welcome it back to the Rio Group. The Rio Group showed that it is a reliable mechanism for political consultation and cooperation  as it demonstrated when the crisis which endangered the constitution of Venezuela occurred and when it sent a delegation which took an active part in seeking to restore full democracy in Peru. Furthermore  through the Rio Group  meetings were held and a treaty of cooperation with the European Community was signed  and meetings were also held with countries of the Persian Gulf  Japan  China and Canada. The process of regional integration  whose ultimate objective is that of creating a vast common economic zone throughout the American continent  has  in addition to MERCOSUR  made great progress in the form of the Andean Pact  the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and  first and foremost  the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA)  which is a blueprint for integration that has already been agreed upon by the United States of America and by Mexico and Canada. On behalf of my country  I should like to extend my congratulations and best wishes for success to those countries.  Permit me to speak to you  however briefly  about Paraguay  my own country  which was reborn to democracy and recovered its freedom just four years ago. Our President  Andres Rodriguez  in this very Hall  addressing the General Assembly during the forty-fourth session  said: ""Paraguay has set its feet firmly on the path of political democracy."" (A/44/PV.6. p. 21) Today I can say  with legitimate pride  that the Government of Paraguay is keeping its promise. My country is living in a legitimate  genuine and fruitful democracy based on boundless respect for human rights and fundamental human freedoms. A new national Constitution  effective since 20 June 1992  is now governing the destiny of my country. This is the result of a democratic debate in a constituent national convention elected by popular will in free elections with the participation of all political forces  and was observed by members of international organizations  both governmental and non-governmental. In the economic and social realm  my country has continued to make progress in consolidating its economy through the process of adjustment and stabilization. We have liberalized trade  and we are giving priority attention to regional integration. Our whole policy of consolidating democracy  accompanied by the necessary process of stabilizing the economy and finances  has been made possible by the determination of the Paraguayan people  who made clear to their rulers that in their country there is no longer room for dictatorship or totalitarianism. But just as the Paraguayan people have become the masters of their new democratic and free destiny  we must recognize the determined support of the international community for our process of democratic consolidation and economic and financial stabilization. In particular  we should like to thank the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  the Organization of American States (OAS) and the European Community for their cooperation and confidence. In conclusion  a few words about the United Nations. As it reaches what we might term the first stage of its existence  the balance sheet is favorable. Its work for peace has been effective. The near-unanimous opinion in recommending structural changes to strengthen it and to endow it with greater dynamism has as its sole cause the profound changes occurring in the world  which call for an Organization more in keeping with new requirements. To preserve peace will continue to be its principal task  but with a more responsive structure that will help reduce the causes of conflict. The whole world  longing as it does for a future of liberty  justice  peace and security  has placed its trust in the United Nations and its effectiveness. "
"132",5864,"QAT",47,1992,"At the outset  I would like to express to you. Sir  my sincere congratulations as you assume this high post. Your election is an expression of the confidence you enjoy. It also emphasizes the role your country  Bulgaria  plays at the regional and world levels and reflects the relations of friendship and cooperation it has maintained with other countries of the world. I would like  in this connection  to commend your predecessor in the presidency of the General Assembly  Ambassador Samir Shihabi  who conducted the work of the previous session of the Assembly with high efficiency. Our current session  the first to be held since our present Secretary-General  Ambassador Boutros Boutros-Ghali  assumed his high office  is convened at the threshold of a new era of profound change with which the world Organization must come to grips in a manner that would enhance its effectiveness and credibility  now that the old bipolarity has disappeared and the burdens faced by the United Nations in every field have increased. There is a great deal of hope set by the peoples of the world on our Organization. In this context  I would like to pay tribute to the former Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose term ended with the conclusion of our last session. In this hall 179 delegations are meeting. Our Organization started with 51 Member States in 1945. This increase in membership reflects the success of the United Nations in eliminating colonialism  and upholding the right of peoples to self-determination and independence. By so doing  the United Nations has achieved the aim of universal membership. This is an achievement we should be proud of and we look forward to seeing it become a launching pad from which the Organization would proceed to translate the noble principles and objectives of the Charter from the realm of ideas to the world of reality. The State of Qatar shares with all Member States the desire of reactivating and developing the United Nations in a manner that would be compatible with the new world situation and which would strengthen the Organization's role in maintaining peace and stability in the world.  We believe that that desired stability will be achieved only through the creation of effective mechanisms for resolving disputes that arise between States either by diplomatic means  such as direct dialogue and mediation  or by recourse to international law as applied by the International Court of Justice. Despite the end of the cold war and the bipolarity which were among the causes of the arms race  arms limitation continues to be one of the main concerns of the United Nations. It was hoped that the end of the cold war would mean a significant and speedy reduction in the magnitude of that arms race. However  this has not been the case. In 1990  experts estimated that 15 per cent of the aggregate of all Government budgets in the world is still being spent on armaments and military preparedness. This is a much higher percentage than that of expenditure on education or on health care. The burden of military expenditure weighs more heavily on developing countries than on industrialized countries because of the discrepancy between the two groups of countries in the area of disposable resources. If we look carefully into the new developments in nuclear armaments we find that the situation is much worse. For while we go on wasting the valuable resources which should be used for development and the building of a better future for man  we endanger that very future with nuclear armament. Therefore  the problem of arms control will remain one of the central issues which the Organization will continue to address in the near future just as it used to do in the past. We in the Gulf region  because of what we went through during the war of liberation of our sister State of Kuwait  have a special interest in prohibiting chemical and other weapons of mass destruction and we attach the greatest of hopes on the success of the Conference on Disarmament in rapidly concluding a convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and preventing the spread of research and production techniques in this field in accordance with General Assembly resolutions  particularly those adopted in the course of its last session. In this connection  I should like to point out the necessity of compliance by Israel  and by all other States of the Middle East  with this convention  both the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and with the regime of international inspection. This should in adherence to the principles of equality and justice and the need to ensure the security of all States of the region without bias or discrimination. Failure by any State in the region to comply with both agreements  or the accordance of special treatment to any of those States would render the whole endeavour void of seriousness and effectiveness. Therefore  we call upon the international community to ensure compliance therewith by Israel. The question of Palestine is one of the questions that have been with the United Nations since its inception and still awaits a solution. My country attaches great importance to this question and hopes for rapid progress towards its solution in the framework of the ongoing peace process. The question of the Palestinian people and the denial by Israel of the inalienable rights of that people is the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict and once the solution of the question of Palestine has been achieved in a manner that would be acceptable to the Palestinians  we will also accept it. If Israel wants to live in peace it should withdraw  not only from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  but also from all the occupied Arab territories  including East Jerusalem  the Golan and southern Lebanon  in accordance with the United Nations Charter and relevant resolutions which stipulate the inadmissibility of the acquisition or annexation of territories by force  and that it is illegal to occupy the territories of others by military force. The State of Qatar welcomes the resumption of negotiation between the concerned parties in Washington and reaffirms its commitment to support the peace effort and expresses its hope that a lasting  equitable and comprehensive solution will be reached to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the question of Palestine on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). The delegation of my country wishes to voice in this world forum its deep concern over the continued suffering of the brotherly people of Somalia and we appeal to all Somali factions to put an end to the bloodshed  set aside their differences and put the national interest first. My country commends the increasing efforts made by the United Nations at present to alleviate the suffering of that people in a bid to move towards restoring stability to that afflicted country. As for the situation in the Gulf  my country reaffirms its commitment to the joint political position of its sister countries  members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) with a view to preserving security and peace in the region  which in turn would contribute to achieving the desired peace in the world. With regard to the island of Abu Mousa  it is regrettable indeed that at this historic stage through which our region is passing such a dispute should arise between the two neighbours  the State of the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Out of our deep concern for the safety and stability of the region  we believe that this dispute should be resolved by peaceful means  through dialogue or by recourse to the law. The disintegration of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has led to serious consequences that have shaken the conscience of humanity. My country is especially concerned over the acts of aggression committed against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and characterized by extreme violence  particularly against the Muslim population of that Republic  with the aim of driving the Muslims out of their homes and country under the slogan of ""ethnic cleansing"". It is the duty of the international community to stand up to this aggression so that the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina  which is a Member State of the United Nations  may preserve its right to freedom and independence. In his statement made in December 1991 after his election as Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali cited the indebtedness of developing countries as one of the more complicated problems which face the world economy and which all States must address effectively and decisively. The former Secretary-General  also  had often drawn attention to this problem  the existence and gravity of which is not hidden from experts and from the States that suffer from its worsening burden which weighs heavily on the developing countries and often makes them unable to meet their economic obligations  with dire social consequences. It is self-evident that meeting the burden of foreign debt in every debtor country would be at the expense of its social programmes and its efforts to raise the-standard of living of its people and thus those poor countries become even poorer. The problem of foreign debt must be dealt with decisively. The United Nations has shown its great concern over the problems of the environment by convening the Rio de Janeiro Conference in mid-1992. Even if that Conference did not rise fully to the level of the hopes set on it  it marked  nevertheless  a positive beginning that could serve as a point of departure for more effective efforts to protect the environment without unnecessary shackles that may impede economic development in developing countries in the name of the protection of the environment which no one disputes. The peoples of the world look forward to the formulation of a new world order which would ensure world peace and rest on the foundations of international law  the principles of justice and equality and of cooperation and brotherhood. That new world order should not inherit the negative attributes of the old order that led to the creation of blocs  conflicts and polarization with all the attendant evils of underdevelopment  poverty  backwardness  hunger  ignorance and disease. The concept of the new world order should be wide enough to embrace international cooperation and unshackled trade and should address the problems of economic development  side by side with the issues of disarmament  indebtedness  environmental protection and social problems. If the new world order is to govern the political  economic and social international relations between States  all States must share  on an equal footing  in its formulation so that it may become an equitable world order that truly represents the joint will of the international community and thus enable the human race to build a safe and happy world  for the present and future generations."
"133",5910,"ROU",47,1992,"I would like first to join previous speakers in extending to Ambassador Ganev my warm congratulations on his election. It gives me particular pleasure to see the representative of one of the new European democracies  which is also a friendly neighbour of Romania  heading such an important session. I should like also to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  whose tireless endeavours to catalyze our common efforts aiming at conferring on the United Nations a new role attuned to a changing world enjoy my country's full support. Within a few days  we in Romania are going to experience a historic moment in the post-revolutionary history of our country. On 27 September  parliamentary and presidential elections - the first since the adoption of our new democratic Constitution will take place. We see them as a landmark for a country whose firm choice of political pluralism  the rule of law  democracy and a market economy has  for the most part  been undeservedly doubted. I want to inform the Assembly that the Romanian Government has done its best to ensure a fair electoral campaign  and free and fair elections. In turn  the presence of thousands of domestic and numerous foreign observers is a solid guarantee of this. It is not my intention to speak here and now about the heavy tolls the Romanian people has already paid on the road to a reform process able to strike a feasible balance between legitimate aspirations and the scarcity of the economic resources needed to meet them. But I feel entitled to say that the incidental lapses that have sometimes seemed to jeopardize the steady course of transition stemmed not from attempts to look back but rather from a certain eagerness to step into the future one day sooner.  Like all the other new Central European democracies  Romania is undergoing a test that has no historical precedent  namely simultaneously to create new political structures and new  workable economic mechanisms. However  as our Prime Minister recently said  we have already saved ourselves from five years of perestroika. And we must keep on forging forward while  paradoxically  we are still searching for gradualism. Moreover  there is no sign that someone has an ideal  fool-proof blueprint for the changes we are striving for. Thank God  it seems that Romania has already left behind most of its childhood diseases. Considering that the saying ""the sooner the better"" goes for measles too  we might prove in the long run to have been among the lucky ones in post-Communist Europe. To cite just one example  I would recall that in the past year allegations concerning so-called Romanian anti-semitism have been frequently voiced. Now  that it has become clear that they were groundless  it is our turn to be concerned that in neighboring countries and other Central European countries  xenophobic  racist and anti-semitic trends have emerged. The crux of the matter for our country and for other countries in transition is to strengthen the learning capacity of society. We have no comfortable dogmas or patterns to follow. We are courageously taking risks. The whole process of reform has already reached the point of no return: another reason why countries in transition should not be left alone  the more so because  in a certain sense  not only post-Communist Europe but the world as a whole is in transition. The economic  moral and political investments Romania has enjoyed during the last year have already proved that our message has been perfectly understood by most of our potential partners. I make no secret that such investments of confidence have followed an ascending curve  one corresponding both to the growing domestic stability of Romania and our ever increasing international confirmation as a reliable pillar of Central European and continental security. Such a positive judgement on the last year's developments in Romania is convincingly supported by a series of parallel achievements in our domestic and our foreign policy. Let me mention just a few of our domestic achievements: the setting up of a new legislative and institutional framework able to guarantee the rule of law  political pluralism  free and fair elections  transition to a market economy and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; the adoption by the Parliament elected in May 1990 of the new Constitution approved by national referendum on 8 December 1991; and the fact that  according to our fundamental law  the State recognizes and guarantees to persons belonging to national minorities the right to preserve  develop and express their cultural  linguistic and religious identity  to which one can add a particular feature of Romania's Constitution  whose article 20 states that ""constitutional provisions concerning the citizens' rights and liberties shall be interpreted and enforced in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and with the covenants and other treaties to which Romania is a party"" and that ""where any inconsistencies exist between the covenants and treaties on fundamental human rights to which Romania is a party and domestic laws  the international regulations shall take precedence"". Another achievement is the local elections held in February 1992  confirmed as fair and free by their main outcome: by the fact that the opposition parties won an important number of seats everywhere in the country. As a result  Romanian society enjoys more balanced political representation  clearly contradicting allegations pointing to the danger of ""monolithism"" in Romania. The fairness of the elections was confirmed also in the conclusions drawn by the foreign observers who witnessed the ballot. The country qualifies to be called pluralistic and democratic. The unfolding of the current election campaign brings new proof that political pluralism  the rule of law  free access to the media  and freedom of speech are becoming normal facts of life in today's Romania. All of these are promises that they will greatly contribute to the strengthening of both the institutional framework and its functioning  thereby irreversibly including Romania in the family of stable and democratic States. Through adequate legislation  the building-up of economic and financial market mechanisms  the privatization of the land  industry  trade  services and tourism  Romania has succeeded in breaking away from the command economy and in becoming more and more attractive to foreign investors. Romania is now in its third year of transition. It has laid the foundations of a market economy and is ready to begin structural reform. As part of the reform  the Romanian Government adopted an economic stabilization programme supported by a stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund. The programme lays stress on classical anti-inflationary measures and  at the same time  has specific elements conditioned by the need to create a market mechanism. As a matter of principle  Romania aims at developing normal relations of cooperation with all States  and in particular with its neighbours. The foreign policy of our Government is inspired by the political will to create the necessary conditions leading to Romania's irreversible anchorage within the Euro-Atlantic space and its viable institutions  and  respectively  to increase the country's contribution to the building-up of the Euro-Atlantic community of values and of a new continental security order. In this spirit  Romania entered into negotiations on an association agreement with the European Communities that is about to be concluded  and a cooperation agreement with the European Free Trade Association. At the same time  like the other Central European countries  Romania entered into a special relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and attaches particular importance to its participation as a partner in the North-Atlantic Co-operation Council. The efforts to restore and consolidate democracy in Romania cannot and should not be isolated from the international environment in which we are living. Our major concern about the situation in Yugoslavia has been made manifest in many circumstances. Being in the unique position in this area of having never waged a fighting war against any of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia  Romania is its only neighbour whose perception and attitude are in no way biased by territorial or other interests of any kind. As a State providing full evidence of balanced conduct and good relations with all the Yugoslav republics  Romania can afford to take a neutral stand on any related matter and is determined to contribute further to the efforts of the international community to restore peace and stability in Yugoslavia. As participants in the London Conference on Yugoslavia  we have stressed that a peaceful settlement is the only acceptable alternative for all the parties to the conflict. Despite the evolution of the conflict in the aftermath of the London Conference  we still believe that the relevant action programme adopted there is comprehensive and realistic  although peace may not be achieved overnight. The concerted efforts of the United Nations and the European Community  supported by all the participants in the Conference  including Romania which is the first non-Community neighbouring country represented in the Steering Committee - should not ignore the fact that the specific patchwork of Yugoslavia has always challenged conventional wisdom. Now it also challenges the application of the basic concepts of international law. There cannot be a separate international law for Yugoslavia. Although the conditions are historically and psychologically peculiar  international law is the same for all. We may think of arrangements adapted to the specific situation and acceptable to the parties concerned. Whatever their contents  they will remain what they are one-time solutions that do not create international law. Given that Romania's initiative in asking for international monitoring of the observance of the embargo along our Danubian frontier with former Yugoslavia has been confirmed as a positive example to be followed by other neighbors  I shall not dwell at length on this matter. But I cannot help underlining that the costly consequences of my country's scrupulous compliance with the resolutions of the Security Council on Yugoslavia have triggered legitimate concerns among the population of the country. It fears that  as in the case of the Gulf War  Romania could again economically and financially pay more than it can afford for being a law-abiding member of the international community. That is why we would suggest that the Security Council devise a set of measures involving the financial institutions and other components of the United Nations system that can help States to meet the economic difficulties entailed by compliance with the regime of sanctions. We envisage a standing compensation fund to be administered by the Security Council in order to alleviate  if not fully compensate for  the economic losses of countries particularly stricken by embargoes and other sanctions established by the Security Council. We are in the process of working out a more detailed proposal to this effect  which we are going to submit to the United Nations community for consideration. The existence of such a fund would be a way of encouraging States to cooperate with the Council in situations of crisis management. In the case of the conflict in the eastern part of the Republic of Moldova  we are seeing a sort of ""pacification"" that is  in fact  proving to be a kind of blackmail for the independence and territorial integrity of that State. It is precisely the same army that generated the conflict and gave arms and other support to separatist forces that today is performing the role of ""peacekeeper"". This pattern has been resorted to in other newly independent States as well. We sometimes ask ourselves if the independence of all these former Soviet republics is taken seriously by the international community or whether it is only a smoke screen behind which a new imperial structure is taking shape. In any case  we in Romania take it seriously. We cannot remain indifferent when we see tendencies to remake the old empire  into which Moldova was forcibly incorporated as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Our interest in the independence and democratic development of a State where 65 per cent of the population is Romanian is natural. We are concerned that a wise propensity for compromise from the Moldovan leaders was rewarded with a policy of fait accompli aimed at institutionalizing the separation of the Trans-Dniestr region from the Republic of Moldova. The evolution of the conflict in the Republic of Moldova  taken in conjunction with the conflicts generated elsewhere in the newly independent States  shows that nostalgia for the former empire exists and has painful consequences for the peoples that have gained their freedom at so high a cost. It is the common wisdom that the United Nations remains a major actor in the whole process of world change and a flag-bearer of indisputable authority. In this respect  the new lease on life given to preventive diplomacy is crucial. An encouraging and valuable political consensus on this issue was expressed during the summit-level Security Council meeting held on 31 January 1992. The report of the Secretary-General ""An Agenda for Peace"" includes a set of inspired guidelines which  once adopted and implemented  would bring us closer to the ideals the United Nations pursues in a world of turbulence. At the same time  we have to be mindful that we are contemplating a long-lasting framework and that there is therefore a need to avoid ephemeral solutions and mechanisms inspired by specific and temporary conflicts or influenced by emotional or short-view approaches.  Given the tragic situation in Yugoslavia and other lessons drawn from recent history  we must also forgo hasty generalizations and biased views. Wisdom and patience  an even-handed attitude  and the spirit of compromise are the necessary basic ingredients for any settlement involving the destiny of peoples. In this respect  we wholeheartedly endorse the pertinent remarks of the Secretary-General  who says in his report that  if every ethnic  religious or linguistic group claimed statehood  there would be no limit to fragmentation  and peace  security and economic well-being for all would become ever more difficult to achieve. Yet  we would find it extremely useful if the General Assembly were to analyse more thoroughly the concept of the self-determination of peoples in order to prevent any distortion of this specific concept in the sense of extrapolating it to the case of national minorities. Generally speaking  we should try to avoid a risky tendency towards a ""proliferation of principles"". Of course  some might be tempted to say that the current turmoils in different parts of the world are living proof that the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter are out of date or at least incomplete. We share the view with the great majority of United Nations Member States that it is not the principles that are wanting but the way they are put into practice. Disregard or breaches of international law favour conflicts and not a so-called ""scarcity"" of principles. The year 1992 is a milestone year for cooperative measures aimed at arms control and disarmament  transparency and confidence  strengthening action-oriented dialogue  and cooperation on security issues. The Romanian Government welcomes the conclusion of the Convention on the destruction and prohibition of chemical weapons and is ready to sign the Convention in January 1993 in Paris. We regard this Convention as a genuine pillar of international security. At the same time  the set of major agreements that were signed or that entered into force this year at the European level the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe  the Vienna Document  the Helsinki Final Act on Conventional Armed Forces  and the Open Skies Treaty - have laid the foundation for lasting cooperation and stability on the Continent. The opening in Vienna  this very week  of the Forum for Security Cooperation launches a further stage of the dialogue among the participating States of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in their joint endeavour for increased security and stability for each and every country in the Euro-Atlantic area. In addition  particular mention should be made of the historical processes within both the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the partnership established among the Western European Union (WEU) member States and the eight countries of Central Europe  including Romania. Thus  step by step  the basic components of a new security order in Europe are taking shape  taking into account the structural transformations on the European continent. In fact  today the security of any country in the European sphere cannot be conceived but as a result of harmonious interaction between the United Nations  CSCE  NATO and WEU  and also of increased efforts at the subregional level. We welcome the decisions to convene the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 and a world summit on social development in 1995. In our opinion  the 1993 World Conference should represent an important occasion for putting a final stop to the tendencies to politicize minority issues by taking them out of their natural framework - the framework of human rights a framework which offers the best and the only viable answers to concerns connected to  guaranteeing and respecting the legitimate rights of persons belonging to national minorities and to the protection of ethnic  cultural  linguistic and religious identity. The health of the world community vitally depends on the health of our planet itself. The Rio Conference proved that mankind is ready to forge a new partnership for promoting sustainable development the key concept to safeguarding human civilization. Romania is ready to put its shoulder to the wheel with a view to alleviating as soon as possible the actual threats to the health of our planet and to the wealth of the world community. Seeing in this audience representatives of such a great family of nations  we realize the immense potential that good will and determination can offer to the genuine universality of the world Organization. I am happy to welcome all new States Members of the United Nations and to extend to all of them the best wishes of my Government and the Romanian people. May I address our congratulations to the representatives of Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  and Uzbekistan. I am confident that the authoritative voice of the United Nations will be a source  for action-oriented measures for the sake and well-being of all nations. Romania  as a democratic country fully attached to the ideals embodied in the United Nations Charter  in making its own contribution to the achievement of mankind's aspirations and to the vital answers we are expected to give to the challenges of the forthcoming century  in which international cooperation should be governed by law. For its cogency with the objectives of the current United Nations Decade of International Law  I would like to recall the  prophetic words of a great Romanian diplomat  Nicolae Titulescu  who  55 years ago  stated: ""Only when the law shines like the rising Sun in the soul of all men as a guiding spirit  an imperative requirement  and a self-imposed obligation that is one with organized freedom only then will Mankind have been saved."" "
"134",5956,"RUS",47,1992,"First  I wish to congratulate you  Mr. President  on your election to this important post. The fact that a representative of Bulgaria has assumed this post at the head of the Assembly at precisely this time is a sign of the importance that the world community attaches to the peaceful democratic revolution in Eastern Europe. And we are proud that our countries  linked by ties of traditional friendship  are treading this path together. The democratic movement has prevailed in the cold war. For the first time in history unprecedented opportunities have opened up for the implementation of the principles proclaimed by the United Nations. The post-confrontational and post-communist world is not a pax Sovietica. a pax Americana  a pax Islamica or a pax Christiana  nor is it a monopolistic system of any kind  but rather the multipolar unity in diversity that the United Nations has symbolized from the very outset. For the present  such a world is only a possibility yet to be realized through our joint efforts. Realism leaves no room for euphoria. A difficult period of transition lies ahead. But realism compels us to reject any alternative to the democratic choice. Russia  which has rejected communism  has  perhaps more than any other country  learned from its own experience that there can be no alternative to democratic development; our country voted for democracy during the first nation-wide presidential election in its history  and defended it at the barricades around the Moscow White House. Neither the President  nor the Government  nor the majority of Parliament  nor the country at large will turn aside from the path of reform  no matter how difficult it may prove. Totalitarianism robbed Russia both of its unique identity and of the possibility of self-fulfilment in its relations with other nations. Through its self-imposed isolation  the richest country of Eurasia became the sick man of Europe and Asia. In contrast  only an open society and a policy of openness will enable Russia to find and play to the fullest extent its unique and historic role. This policy has its roots in an age-old Russian idea. Back in the thirteenth century Saint Alexander Nevsky  one of the founders and defenders of the Russian State  said: ""God is to be found not in power but in truth"". Today this is the policy of the true national interests of the Russian State as a normal rather than an aggressive great Power  as one that recognizes and shoulders its responsibilities as a permanent member of the Security Council. The basic elements of this policy are as follows: partnership and alliance for democracy and a dynamic market economy with countries that share these values; good-neighbourly relations with all neighbouring States; comprehensive strengthening of the Commonwealth of Independent States  strategic partnership with Ukraine  Belarus  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan and all other countries created in the place of the former Soviet Union; and solidarity and mutually advantageous cooperation with all the members of the world community. Russia intends to act in support of United Nations efforts to address the twofold task of the democratization of societies and the renewal of international relations. This is consonant with the concluding statement of the summit meeting of the Security Council  with Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's report ""An Agenda for Peace"" and with the first statements already made from this rostrum. Russia is ready to give practical support to the proposals made yesterday by George Bush  President of the United States. First of all  it is necessary to extinguish armed conflicts. The Russian Federation will increase its efforts to eliminate conflicts inherited from the past in the territory of the former USSR  bearing in mind the special interest and responsibility of Russia in strengthening the civilized principles of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in this part of the world. Russia supports the participation of the new independent States in these two organizations and other international forums. We welcome their representatives in this Hall. We categorically reject imperialistic ambitions  diktat and violence  both in the area of the former USSR and in other parts of the world. Should political means fail  force can and should be used to separate the warring sides  to protect human rights and humanitarian missions and to restore peace in strict conformity with the Charter of the United Nations. Agreements for cease-fires and for the establishment of peace-keeping forces  concluded with Russian participation  are already in effect in Ossetia  the Dniester region and Abkhazia  where Russian soldiers are carrying out their peace-keeping duties. Together with CSCE  we will strive to end the war and bring peace to Karabakh and to secure the integrity of Tajikistan and bring national reconciliation to that country. In all those efforts we count on continued active cooperation with the United Nations. We support efforts aimed at forcing Iraq to implement the decisions of the United Nations and ensuring at the same time the territorial integrity and the peaceful nature of that State. For that purpose  Russia has sent two naval vessels to the Persian Gulf. We also must ensure that the demands of the Security Council are complied with by all the Yugoslav sides and must enable them to maintain contact with the United Nations. A Russian infantry battalion is serving honourably with the United Nations forces in Yugoslavia. I agree with the preceding speaker concerning the need to support the efforts of Mr. Panic for the practical implementation of the intentions he has declared.  Russia will continue to cooperate actively with the other permanent members of the Security Council and with all the parties concerned in order to seize the opportunity for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East  Cambodia  Angola and other areas of conflict. We have no doubt that it is the task of the United Nations to combat violence with force based on law  with its potential for enforcing peace. The Blue Helmets should take action in response even when they are fired upon. It is time to strengthen the capacity of the Security Council to take swift and decisive action in humanitarian emergency situations arising from mass violations of human rights and inter-ethnic clashes  including those within national borders. It is important to strengthen the preventive component of United Nations activities. This includes the establishment of hot lines to United Nations Headquarters  the submission of intelligence information to the Secretary-General and the further development of fact-finding. Enhanced United Nations efforts to safeguard human rights and the rights of national minorities are also a priority. In the past it was chiefly the victims of totalitarian regimes and ideologies who needed protection. What is increasingly needed now is to combat the aggressive nationalism that is emerging as the new global threat. The replacement of ideological intolerance with national and religious intolerance would threaten the world which is increasingly becoming one world - with rifts just as serious and with national  regional and global catastrophes. Democratic Russia categorically rejects any form of chauvinism  be it Russophobia or anti-Semitism. We feel special concern at the growing discriminatory practices against Russians  Ukrainians  Jews and all other non-indigenous nationalities in some of the new States that have emerged in the territory of the former USSR  particularly in Estonia and Latvia. A situation in which 42 per cent of the population of the Estonian Republic are disenfranchised is totally inconsistent with international law. We have raised and will continue to raise these issues in the United Nations and other forums. We have the right to do so  among other reasons  because the countries in question won their independence  to a substantial extent  through the triumph of the democrats in Russia. The practices I have referred to can in no way be justified by invoking the problem  inherited from the USSR  of the withdrawal of armed forces from the Baltic States. We are already working together to resolve that problem  and we intend to resolve it as soon as possible; however  due regard must also be given to the rights of those who are in military uniform. It would be appropriate to give thought to a joint interpretation of the international trusteeship system set forth in the Charter of the United Nations  particularly since one of its basic objectives is and I quote the Charter - ""To encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race  sex  language  or religion"". That system has brought many nations to independence. Today national minorities desperately need the trusteeship of the world community. The fate of former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner in Afghanistan remains one of the gravest humanitarian problems. We call upon the General Assembly to proclaim its support for the urgent resolution of this problem. The rejection of the game of ""nuclear roulette"" in favour of cooperation in the interests of strategic stability for all and with the participation of all States concerned is reflected in the agreements on further drastic cuts in strategic offensive arms and on a global defense system reached in Washington by the Presidents of Russia and the United States of America. Reaffirming its commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  the Russian Federation invites all countries that have not yet done so to join the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. It is our belief that all the former Republics of the USSR  including Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan  will do so. This step should be taken as soon as possible  since the entry into force of the treaty on strategic offensive arms depends on it. We expect that a sense of high responsibility and a readiness to reach compromise solutions will prevail in the decisive phase of the approval of the Convention on the banning of chemical weapons. Russia is in favour of control  including control through the United Nations  over international arms transfers  especially over offensive and highly destructive weapons. The approach taken with respect to regimes that disregard the standards of international law should be particularly strict. There is an obvious need for the development of concrete military-industry conversion programmes  not only through the efforts of individual countries but also through the combined action of the international community. The United Nations and its specialized agencies could play a pioneering role in this endeavour. In the long run  real disarmament and the conversion of military industries to peaceful production will make it possible to release additional resources for the needs of development. But development cannot be achieved without ensuring full political and economic rights and freedoms  without releasing human creative potential in a market environment. Russia has learned this from its own experience. For a successful solution of the problems of development  it is extremely important to strengthen the interaction between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions. Herein lies the key to the harmonization of the world community's efforts in such areas as support of macroeconomic reforms and technical assistance and the provision of help in resolving social problems. Both developing and developed countries will benefit from this. The United Nations Conference at Rio de Janeiro reinforced the consensus on the need to integrate development policies and environmental protection. The task of renewing international relations calls for the rationalization of the United Nations itself and of the United Nations system. The desire of some States to play a more active role in the United Nations is quite natural. The Charter provides ample scope for this. In particular  the Charter permits the Security Council to establish auxiliary bodies in which many States would participate. We are convinced that the United Nations and other international organizations will play a growing role in regulating international relations. In conclusion  I should like to address you  Mr. Secretary-General. Russia supports your efforts to bring about the settlement of international crises  to improve the efficiency of the United Nations Secretariat and the coordination of the activities of all international agencies. Support of the United Nations presupposes the fulfilment of financial obligations to the Organization. Despite its economic difficulties  in the period from September of this year to March 1993 Russia will pay $130 million as partial payment of our arrears to the United Nations and an additional $30 million to other agencies. Your recent statements in Moscow  Mr. Secretary-General  have confirmed the similarity of our vision of the great future of the United Nations. "
"135",6003,"RWA",47,1992,"The forty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly provides the democratic transitional Rwandese Government the welcome opportunity to hail the annual gathering for the conduct of international diplomacy  and thus to make its contribution to the discussions on peace  security and development in the world. However  allow me  at the outset Sir  to express to you my warm congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election is confirmation of the esteem and respect you enjoy in the international community. You are a man of experience  dialogue and conviction and these outstanding qualities guarantee success for the work of this session of the Assembly. The Rwandese delegation wishes to assure you. Sir  of our complete readiness to make a positive contribution to the success of this session. Concern for effectiveness in the service of peace  justice and development was always the driving force behind your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi. I should like to express to him our profound gratitude for his major contribution to the development of the United Nations. May I also be permitted  on behalf of my delegation  to welcome very warmly the courageous and innovative initiatives that have been undertaken by our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for peace  justice and security and for international cooperation and the mutually supportive development of all members of the international community. Such initiatives are certainly intended to open up a new world political  economic  social and cultural order. This will involve creating international solidarity between the peoples and countries of the planet so that they can jointly achieve their common destiny in peace and justice. In this regard  my country  Rwanda  is happy to note that between September 1990 and September 1992 the United Nations carried out important actions to improve international political and economic relations. Some particular achievements were: the Programme of Action for the Least Developing Countries for the 1990s  adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries  held in Paris from 3 to 14 September 1990; the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s  adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 1991; a new partnership for sustainable development  advocated by the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  which took place in Cartagena  Colombia from 8 to 25 February 1092; and Agenda 2 1  adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which was held in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  from 3 to 14 June 1992. This is a small sample of actions with the same goal: the progressive building of a world that is more united and more mutually supportive. However  it can be achieved only after the definitive elimination of totalitarian or autocratic regimes that hinder the flowering and development of peoples in many countries of the world. Therefore  the restoration of democracy and political pluralism are preconditions for the success of a new world political order. That is why  on 10 June 1991  Rwanda took the firm decision to move from autocracy and a single-party system to democracy and political pluralism. Since that time 16 political parties have been officially registered  and five of them are represented in the Government of democratic transition  which I have had the honour to lead since 16 April 1992. The current democratic process in Rwanda  although it has passed through a number of important stages and has reached the point of no return  is encountering some difficulties because of the existence of forces that are resistant to change. We think that this is the result of the fact that in politics  as in physics  as soon as forces of change are set in motion  the forces of inertia arise to counter them. That is why the Government of transition has set as its major goal the task of putting democracy in the country on a firm footing. To do so  it has decided to undertake in-depth reforms to transform Rwandese political life. Thus institutional reforms will be carried out to ensure the separation and independence of the three branches of civil power: the legislative  the executive and the judiciary. Furthermore  appropriate machinery will be set up to allow the population to participate effectively in the country's administration. Therefore  the political  social and moral forces in our country have been invited to contribute to the conduct of the democratic process under way in Rwanda. The process of democratizing Rwandese political life is also viewed as a solution to the war that has been going on in Rwanda since 1 October 1990. This unjust  fratricidal and costly war has no objective raison d'√™tre. The Rwandese Government feels that there can be no military solution to this conflict; that is why it has committed itself to seeking a negotiated solution. I should like to inform the international community of the efforts made by the multiparty Government of transition to end this conflict. These efforts have been directed on the one hand towards the Rwandese Patriotic Front  which began the war  and on the other to our neighbouring countries  with a view to normalizing our relations and to coordinating our actions aimed at restoring peace in the subregion of the Great Lakes countries. Within this framework  an agreement on mutual security cooperation was signed with Uganda on 8 August 1992. The Government has resolutely committed itself to a frank and sincere dialogue with the Rwandese Patriotic Front. In this context  direct negotiations have been taking place in Arusha  United Republic of Tanzania  since 10 July 1992 with the participation of observers from Burundi  United Republic of Tanzania  Uganda  Zaire  Senegal  France  Belgium  Germany  the United States of America and the Organization of African Unity. The parties concerned would also like the United Nations to take part in the negotiations. The first phase of these negotiations  which took place from 10 to 12 July 1992  ended with the signing of a cease-fire agreement between the two parties. There is reason to welcome the fact that this cease-fire has been respected by all sides in spite of some irregularities. The second phase  which took place from 10 to 18 August 1992  brought about the signing of a protocol agreement for a government of law  a protocol defining the basic principles that are to govern political life in Rwanda: national unity  democracy  political pluralism and respect for human rights. The third phase of the negotiations  which took place from 7 to 17 September 1992  has just been suspended and will resume on 5 October 1992. None the less  the two parties have already taken another important step by agreeing to the existence and separation of the three powers: legislative  executive and judiciary. Let us recall that this third phase is devoted to definition of the machinery and procedures for power-sharing. The Rwandese Government defends respect for the State institutions and agrees to the integration of the Rwandan Patriotic Front into those institutions as well as to the making of institutional arrangements to speed up the process of democratizing Rwandese political life and for favouring the effective participation of the political forces of the country in managing the State. The work of this phase will resume on 5 October and we hope that at that time the two parties will show sufficient political open-mindedness and realism to find common ground quickly. Following that phase there is provision for a fourth one which will study the modalities for integrating the fighters of the Rwandan Patriotic Front into the Rwandese Army. Over and above the efforts to end the war in Rwanda  which has been going on since 1 October 1990  Rwanda reiterates its firm will to find a just and lasting solution to the problem of its refugees. To this end  the Rwandese Government reaffirms solemnly that the return of Rwandese refugees to their country is an inalienable right that no one can challenge. Actions to facilitate the welcoming of these refugees who opt for repatriation have been undertaken. Mention may be made in particular of the identification of reinstallation zones  the promulgation of a general amnesty law  and the sensitizing and educating of the population to welcome the returnees in a spirit of reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. The Government of Rwanda has also decided to ensure diplomatic protection for Rwandese refugees who may have chosen to stay in host countries. These refugees will enjoy all the civil rights that are recognized for other Rwandese citizens. The Government of Rwanda takes this opportunity to make another urgent appeal to the High Commissioner for Refugees and to the Organization of African Unity to accelerate the completion of the plan of action for the repatriation of Rwandese refugees and the holding of the donors' round table  which should take place before the end of this year. The war in our country has entailed considerable economic  social and cultural losses. One of the unfortunate consequences of this war undoubtedly remains the tragic situation of displaced persons  who at present number more than 350 000. They are located in 20 camps  where dozens of them are dying every day from hunger  cold and poor hygiene. We take this opportunity to make an urgent appeal to the international community to come to the assistance of these displaced persons. We expect this community to come to our assistance by providing food  tents  blankets and medicine. In monetary terms  what is needed to maintain these persons displaced as a result of war amounts to $30 million a year. Moreover  we are asking friendly countries that have always stood by us not to remain aloof but rather to give increased financial assistance for the rehabilitation of infrastructures and areas destroyed by war and also for economic recovery. In terms of international trade  Rwanda has suffered heavy losses because of the closing of the Kigali-Mombasa via Kampala road. Current talks among the users of the north corridor are of great interest for Rwanda  which would like to see this road reopened as quickly as possible. The Rwandese economy  like that of other developing countries  continues to feel the effects of world economic imbalances and the burden of debt which is still suffocating the economies of the poorest countries in the world. The drop in world prices for coffee  which is the principal export product of Rwanda  and which went from $2.50 in 1986 to less than 60 cents from 1982 on  has caused a considerable drop in earnings for the Rwandese economy. As a result of this deplorable situation the gross domestic product of Rwanda at first stagnated and then dropped while the balance-of-payments problem remained largely one of indebtedness and some development projects had to be stopped because there were no means for investment in them. Despite these indicators which are not very encouraging  the Government has taken courageous measures to limit the losses: drastic reduction in public expenditures; credit restrictions; and the devaluation of the currency  which in two years lost more than half its value. The Government of Rwanda expresses its gratitude to the friendly countries and international organizations which have been broadly contributing to the execution of our structural adjustment programme. The Government of Rwanda is also counting upon them to support the sectoral programmes for economic recovery that are under way in our country. After this survey of the economic and political situation prevailing in our country  allow me now to take up some of the major international problems of the moment. Before doing so  I should like  as other delegations have done here  to warmly welcome the new Members to the great family of the United Nations. We wholeheartedly congratulate them and we encourage them to work for the triumph of the noble ideals of the United Nations. Mankind remains torn by bloody conflicts and wars that result from anachronistic situations of colonialism  oppression  racism and ideological intolerance. The seeds of blind violence are multiplying wherever the sovereignty of peoples and the territorial integrity of States are being undermined and wherever the dignity and fundamental rights of man are being trampled upon by totalitarian regimes. In this context  the Rwandese delegation praises the untiring efforts of the United Nations to extinguish the flames in various hotbeds of tension and to put an end to murderous  fratricidal conflicts that occur in the North as well as in the South. In this respect  the Rwandese Government would like to congratulate the Secretary-General of our Organization for his remarkable contribution and for the ways and means he advocates in his ""Agenda for Peace""  which would favour preventive diplomacy and peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-building actions. Rwanda also welcomes the initiative taken by the twenty-eighth Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  which allowed the Security Council to give serious consideration to ways and means of controlling the outbreak of massacres in South Africa. The Rwandese delegation hopes that dismantling the legal pillars of apartheid will quickly lead to the establishment of a multiracial and democratic South African society. It encourages the South African Government to conclude negotiations with the African National Congress and to set up a democratic Government that represents all the people of South Africa. Rwanda is pleased at the resumption of peace negotiations in the Middle East. We encourage all the parties involved to cooperate in good faith so that that new diplomatic opportunity will be seized to the fullest in order to achieve a lasting peace. Against that background  the Rwandese Government pays tribute to the new Israeli Government's gesture of halting the establishment of Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab territories. The Rwandese Government also supports all efforts to restore peace in the Horn of Africa  Liberia and other regions of the world  in particular Lebanon  Afghanistan  Cambodia  Cyprus and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The success of the commitment of the United Nations to the process of national reconciliation and democratization now under way in Central America reflects the renewed influence of our Organization in the management of crises and the seeking of negotiated solutions to local conflicts. In addition  Rwanda notes with satisfaction the continuing dialogue between the parties directly involved in the conflict in Western Sahara. Hence Africa still hopes to see the organization of a referendum  under the auspices of the United Nations  on the future status of that Territory. Rwanda welcomes the current restructuring of the United Nations system and the end of the cold war. We hope that disarmament will lead to a positive net transfer of resources to the South  where the struggle against poverty remains a constant challenge. It is on this hopeful note that I should like once again to make an urgent appeal to the international community to give diplomatic support to the process of peace negotiations in Rwanda and to help  financially and materially  with the repatriation of Rwandese refugees. The active participation of the United Nations in the Arusha negotiations would be an additional guarantee of the will of the international community to find a just  speedy and lasting solution to the Rwandese conflict. We also appeal to the international community to come to the assistance of the 350 000 displaced persons and to help in the reinvigoration of our economy. For its part  the Rwandese Government is committed to carrying out our country's current democratization process until the establishment of a State founded on law where all Rwandese  whether they live in or out of the country  will have the right to exercise their civil rights freely and without any discrimination whatsoever and to participate actively in the management of public affairs. "
"136",6048,"SAU",47,1992,"I would like to begin by expressing to you  Mr. President  our sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. The trust and confidence bestowed upon you reflects appreciation for you personally as well as recognition of the positive role played by your country  Bulgaria  in international affairs. I wish you success in the pursuit of your mission. On this occasion  I would like to congratulate your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi  for his effective conduct of the affairs of the General Assembly during its previous session. I also would like to acknowledge the continued sincere efforts by the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to enhance the prospects for peace and reduce the elements of tension which prevail in many parts of the world. These efforts and pursuits represent a continuation of the efforts of his predecessor  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. I am pleased to join with the other heads of delegations in welcoming all the States which have joined the United Nations this year so that they may participate  along with all other Member States  in realizing the noble objectives of this Organization. It is my hope that these States will be able to play an effective role in the Organization  and contribute positively to the realization of peace  security  stability  and development for the benefit of the international community as a whole. We are assembled here in this international forum in which nations  small and large  powerful and weak  meet on the basis of equality and work together for the establishment of right and justice  order and security  prosperity and peace. We learn from the lessons of the past  to chart a course for the future in an environment of fast-changing global conditions and circumstances. We follow  with great interest  the general trends of what has come to be known as the new world order  an order founded upon the principles of the United Nations and on the tenets of international legality. This order rejects the use of force in the settlement of disputes. We must understand that this order cannot evolve by itself  but requires us to change our perception of the role of the United Nations. We must develop our methods and practices in harmony with the basic principles of the Organization  whose purpose is to replace war ind destruction with cooperation between nations and peoples and thereby lead to development  respect for the dignity of man  security  peace and prosperity for our world. Therefore  it is incumbent upon us to bring about a fundamental change in our understanding of the role of the United Nations from one of crisis management and the preservation of peace to one of active participation in peacemaking. In this context  I would like to express appreciation for the proposals presented by the Secretary-General for enhancing the role and effectiveness of the United Nations. His Agenda for Peace which contained those proposals  deserves prompt attention  objective consideration and thorough study in order for us to arrive at an appropriate formula for the functioning of the Organization that would be compatible with its desired more effective role. Subsequently  attention could be given to the introduction of basic structural and institutional changes  if required. Even a cursory review of the current international situation would reveal that there still remain hotbeds of tension which threaten security and stability in many regions of the world. It would show too that the role of the United Nations becomes increasingly more important concomitantly with the  increase in the possibilities and opportunities for cooperation among nations in enhancing and supporting the Organization so that no nation may commit aggression against or threaten the security  sovereignty and territorial integrity of any other nation. The United Nations has clearly demonstrated that it is capable of playing such a role when it firmly faced up to the Iraqi aggression against its neighbour  Kuwait  a peaceful nation that may be small in size but which plays a major role and makes major contributions to the family of nations. By so doing  the United Nations was able to liberate Kuwait from a blatant aggression and restore legality to its territory. The image of this noble stand still remains before us and is indelibly etched in our minds. On this occasion  it behoves us to express our appreciation and admiration for this role and to emphasize now  more than ever  the need for it to continue and be promoted  for we have noticed recently the return of the Iraqi regime to the pattern of threats and false claims regarding Kuwait in a manner that is reminiscent of that regime's declarations on the eve of its aggression against Kuwait. In so doing  it makes a mockery of its obligations under international treaties and resolutions. It also continues to procrastinate in implementing the resolutions of the Security Council and fails to comply with their stipulations. It has given itself the right  on the basis of sovereignty  to starve and humiliate the Iraqi people and subject Iraq to dangers that threaten its unity and security while it goes on claiming  falsely and slanderously  that it is the international community that is responsible for the dangers that beset Iraq and the miseries of its people. We are totally convinced that the only means of averting instability in the region and dealing with the suffering of the people of Iraq lies  first and foremost in ensuring the complete and comprehensive implementation of the resolution of the Security Council which reflect the collective will of the international community. We have heard  with great concern  the declaration by the United Arab Emirates that its efforts have failed to achieve a peaceful and amicable solution with the Islamic Republic of Iran in relation to the complete sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over the three islands of Abu Mousa  Tun the Greater and Tun the Smaller. We express our support for the position taken by the United Arab Emirates on this issue and for its demand that Iran reverse its unilateral actions and that the problem be settled through negotiations on the basis of international law and international legality. The Middle East is among the regions which attract a great deal of the international community's attention and is the focus of its efforts. It is time that this region enjoyed its rightful share of peace  security and stability so that all its energies may be directed towards development and all its resources may be devoted to ensuring the prosperity of its peoples. The Middle East is capable of providing a decent standard of living for all its inhabitants and has the potential to become a peaceful oasis of stability  prosperity and creativity. To achieve the objectives we desire  it is our vital duty to strive to eliminate the threat posed by the stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We therefore welcome the conclusion of negotiations on the non-proliferation convention banning chemical weapons. The draft convention resulting from those negotiations is before the General Assembly at its current session. We affirm our support for the objectives of the draft convention. This support derives from the great concern of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to make the Middle East a region free from weapons of mass destruction of all kinds whether nuclear  chemical or biological. However  that goal can be reached only when all States in the region without exception refrain from the production  stockpiling or possession of weapons of mass destruction of any kinds. It should be noted that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has adhered  both in word and in deed  to the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons  and the Arab States have demonstrated the collective will to adhere to that Treaty as well. It has therefore become imperative that all States in the region  including Israel  abide by both the chemical-weapons convention and the non-proliferation Treaty  so as to achieve the desired balance necessary for peace  security and stability for all States in the region. The Arab States have expressed a sincere  genuine desire to establish a permanent  just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. This has been demonstrated by their participation in the peace negotiations sponsored by the United States and the Russian Federation. Their positive position in those negotiations has proved to be a serious orientation towards ending the Arab-Israeli conflict and towards achieving a just settlement of the Palestinian question that would ensure the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and other relevant resolutions of international legality. In that context  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has lent its full support to the current Middle East peace process. Saudi Arabia believes that no genuine peace can be achieved in the Middle East unless a permanent  just solution to the Palestinian question is reached and unless Israel withdraws from all the occupied Arab territories  including Al-Quds which is an integral part of the occupied Arab territories. The question of Al-Quds has a focal place in the policy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is one of its constant concerns  within the context of the relevant United Nations resolutions and of the resolutions of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. The success of the current Middle East peace process clearly depends on a serious  genuine commitment by Israel to implement the resolutions of international legality and on Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories  including Al-Quds Al-Sharif. The Lebanese Government has made considerable progress in the implementation of the Taef accords and has adopted the necessary political and constitutional measures in that context. We must continue to support the efforts of the legitimate authorities in Lebanon and contribute to the process of reconstruction in Lebanon. In that regard  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia appeals to the international community to help facilitate the establishment of an international fund to assist Lebanon. We must also reiterate the need for an Israeli commitment fully and unconditionally to implement Security Council resolution 425 (1978)  which calls on Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon to enable the Lebanese Government to extend legitimate authority over the entire territory of Lebanon. The General Assembly was right in deciding to deny the legality of the succession of the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the seat held by the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We view this as a step in the right direction and hope that other steps will follow with a view to restoring peace and stability to that part of the Balkans. The people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are falling victim to a genocidal war waged by Serbian forces with the support of Serbia and Montenegro. That genocidal war has claimed thousands of innocent victims and has resulted in the displacement of a large portion of the population away from their homes and possessions. My country has already declared its full support for the decisions and resolutions adopted with the consent of all parties concerned at the recent London Conference on the situation in the former Yugoslavia. We hope that concerted efforts will be made to ensure the full and serious implementation of those resolutions. So far  however  we regret that none of them has been implemented. We refer to resolutions such as those concerned with the placement of heavy weapons and artillery under international supervision; declaring the airspace of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the operations of military aircraft; the release of all prisoners-of-war and detainees; the dismantling of detention camps; and the termination of the policy of ethnic cleansing. On this issue  the Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques does not believe that ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance through the United Nations to the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina is sufficient. Rather  we believe that all necessary measures should be adopted to stop all the acts of genocide and displacement that are being perpetrated by the Serbian forces with the support of the Belgrade regime. That requires the intensification of pressure on the Serbs and their supporters to force them to abide by the commitments they took upon themselves at the London Conference. The creation of a permanent mechanism to monitor the implementation of those commitments is very necessary. We note with grave concern that there is some hesitation in declaring the airspace of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the military aircraft of Serbia and Montenegro. The hesitation ostensibly stems from a concern that such a step would lead to an aggravation of the situation. But the situation is extremely grave as it is and cannot get much worse. The real dangers to be taken into consideration are those which the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina face  namely  genocide  displacement and torture. All of those constitute the most flagrant violations of the United Nations Charter  the principles and tenets of international law  and the Fourth Geneva Convention. The war that rages there is not even a civil war but a war of extermination waged openly on the people of a sovereign  independent State whose territory has been occupied by the perpetrators of that brutal and savage aggression. Accordingly  we call upon the Security Council of the United Nations to take all necessary measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter  including Article 42; starting with the declaring of the airspace of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone for the air forces of Serbia and Montenegro and ensuring the withdrawal of all regular and irregular Serbian forces from the territories of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the same time  we urge the international community to make available all possible material  military and moral support to enable the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise fully the legitimate right of self-defence. In the absence of an effective collective security mechanism  the arms embargo on the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be lifted. We are also of the view that those responsible for grave violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention should be apprehended and placed on trial according to the principles and provisions of international law. We also support the right of the people and Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina to just compensation from Serbia and Montenegro for the loss of life and property they have suffered. Somalia is currently a nation plagued by disasters and tragedies as a result of a destructive civil war which has brought upon its people death and displacement and undermined its unity and territorial integrity. The Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques have endeavoured from the outset of the conflict in sisterly Somalia to contain that conflict invited all the parties to the conflict to meet on Saudi soil for the purpose of achieving national reconciliation. Saudi Arabia still exerts all possible efforts to put an end to that fratricidal conflict. Saudi Arabia also provides assistance and relief to Somalia and unequivocally supports the role of the United Nations in delivering assistance to those who deserve it. It has welcomed the dispatch of international forces to supervise operations that provide humanitarian assistance to all regions of Somalia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hopes that concerted international efforts will be made to provide all possible assistance and relief to this afflicted nation and supports the effort to put an end to the bloodshed. We urge all Somali factions to work together towards making their national interest and human values their overriding objective so as to eliminate the causes of conflict and disunity among them. After 13 years of successful jihad the Afghani people were able to triumph over injustice and regain their national identity. On this occasion we look forward to the joining of all constructive and sincere efforts to enable the Afghani people to achieve security and stability in their nation. We also look forward to the return of normal conditions throughout Afghanistan  to make possible the rebuilding of what has been destroyed and thus to enable the people of Afghanistan to work towards achieving a national unity that would bring together the various groups and organizations and provide a climate conducive to national unity and the deployment of concerted efforts in pooling all energies and resources for the well-being and in the interests of that country's people. We also need to point out that that part of the world is still suffering from the continuation of the Jamu-Kashmir problem  which continues to be an element of instability in the region. The Government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques believe that a solution must be found on the basis of United Nations resolutions to put an end to this long-standing conflict which has cast its shadow over relations between the two neighbours  India and Pakistan.  While voicing its regrets at the violence South Africa has been experiencing over the past few months and the serious setbacks it has caused to the efforts aiming at ending the apartheid system  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia welcomes the recent developments in that country  which revive our hope for progress towards the dismantling of that abhorrent system. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports a major role for the United Nations in offering appropriate solutions and in working towards the establishment of a society governed by equality and justice. The positive changes that have taken place in the international political situation are bound to pave the way for addressing the issues of development and for the creation of an international economic environment that would help the developing nations to achieve the sort of economic and social development that would enable them to realize the ambitions and aspirations of their peoples after a better life of peace and prosperity. The developed industrialized nations can cooperate in making this possible by opening their markets to the products of the developing nations  ending all protectionist measures  bringing about at an early date a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks and by finding an urgent solution to the debt problem. Economic cooperation between the developing countries themselves is also necessary as it would constitute a fundamental tool for the promotion of international economic growth. Questions pertaining to the situation of the world economy are of great importance and interest to us in Saudi Arabia  for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has a stake in ensuring the stability and soundness of the world economy and in avoiding the hurdles and pitfalls that may affect its growth.  Proceeding from this  it has responded positively to the ongoing discussions on the environment and development and has shouldered its responsibility in this respect by participating in the international deliberations aimed at finding well-balanced and practicable solutions to the questions of climatic change on a sound scientific basis. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is convinced that the future of the world and the prosperity of all its inhabitants depend on a clear understanding of the environmental problems that face the planet  full understanding of the consequences that may result from the policies adopted in dealing with those problems  careful weighing of the burdens and commitments taken by the countries of the world upon themselves in addressing those problems  special attention to the situation of the developing energy producers and consumers alike and careful examination of the effects the policies adopted in dealing with the problems may have on the growth of the economies of those countries. This would constitute a valuable contribution to the achievement of comprehensive development and the raising of the standard of living of our peoples so that they may enjoy prosperity  peace  security and stability. The current international situation that has developed from the ending of the cold war and the progress achieved in the areas of disarmament and reductions in conventional weapons  is a rare opportunity indeed for channelling resultant windfalls towards solving the problems of development and underdevelopment. The international community is on the threshold of a historic new era whose challenges and promises are unfolding under our eyes. We are duty-bound to lay solid and equitable foundations that define the parameters of the future that humanity has always aspired after  a future in which no one would awaken to the expectation of war or goes to bed haunted by the nightmarish prospects of destruction  a future that would melt down the weapons of destruction in order to forge the tools of prosperity for all  a future in which the dangers of pollution  the effects of underdevelopment and the pains of displacement would vanish. We shall never attain such a future unless we lay the foundations of peace on right and justice. And peace is the essence of our Islamic faith. As the Holy Koran says: 0 ye who believe! Enter into Islam Whole-heartedly; And follow not The footsteps Of the Evil One; For he is to you An avowed enemy. "
"137",6085,"SDN",47,1992,"Allow me  at the outset  to congratulate Mr. Ganev  on behalf of my delegation  on his election to the presidency of this important session of the General Assembly  and to extend to his predecessor  through him  our thanks and appreciation for the skilful manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session. From this rostrum  I also extend our sincere congratulations to the States that have joined the membership of this Organization since the previous session. We welcome them as a new driving force that contributes to the various efforts deployed in the international arena with a view to bringing about prosperity  development  and stability for the peoples and communities of the world. This session  we have before us an important agenda at all political  economic  social  humanitarian  and security levels. All of us must be aware that  today  the world faces a new set of international phenomena that were not active before the Gulf war and its consequences whose impact is being increasingly felt on the international arena from one day to the next. For our part  we recognize that new and different international circumstances emerge with the dawn of every day. The barrier of the ideologies which  in the past  immersed the world in conflict  confrontation and competition for the sake of narrow interests  has collapsed. The improvement in East-West relations has opened up new vistas. However  the period of transition we are living through has spawned new contradictory tendencies  the most conspicuous of which is an intense acerbity in the relations of the wealthy North and the poor South under the circumstances of the so-called new world order. On the other hand  unipolarity has led the world into a new security system controlled by a handful of major Powers in the complete absence of active participation on the part of the rest of the international community. The era of international detente we hear so much about nowadays  is no more  in our view  than detente between those major Powers with their economic and military muscle. That detente has yet to address the closing of the wide gap between North and South  it has yet to reform international economic and commercial relations and it has yet to address the issues of overriding concern to the South  such as the debt burden  poverty  illiteracy and disease. On top of all that  the States of the developing world are being subjected now to the practices of the so-called new international legality which means  inter alia  interference and intervention in the internal affairs of those States and pursuance of the policies of diktat which deprive them of the right of making their own decisions. In the tenth summit of the Non-Aligned Movement  which concluded its meetings in Jakarta a few weeks ago  the Presidents and Heads of Government of the Movement deliberated over the current international situation and the role of the Movement therein. They have voiced their conviction that the Non-Aligned Movement  being the representative of the largest grouping of States and peoples in the world  has a role to play in the context of the unipolarity that reigns in the world today and  therefore  should be included in a flexible mechanism that would aim at a new world balance in which the developing countries of the world should have an effective role in the formulation and setting up of a new world order that must replace the rampant international chaos of today  and put an end to the present marginalization of international covenants and agreements which must be binding to us all. The Presidents and Heads of Government of the Non-Aligned Movement have set for themselves anew the target of ensuring a full presence for the Movement in addressing all the international issues on the world's agenda. They also have set the target of becoming genuine partners in all decisions to be taken particularly within the framework of the United Nations and its Security Council. The international mechanism governing relations between States should  in our opinion  continue to be the United Nations and its agencies. However  in order for this important Organization fully to discharge its duties  the following must be achieved. Full commitment and adherence to the United Nations Charter  which must be developed in a manner that would be compatible with the changes that have taken place in the world since it was signed. The General Assembly must be enabled to play a full role in the maintenance of peace and security. The General Assembly's role should be as important as that of the Security Council's. Selectivity and double standards must be abandoned with respect to the implementation of the Charter's provisions. The Security Council'""  activities should be characterized by transparency. The Council should adopt a democratic approach in the area of decision-making. The United Nations Secretary-General should be able to play his role fully . without diktat from certain States  and should deal with all States on an equal footing. While appreciating the responsibilities of the Secretary-General  we are if the opinion that he should have the time to meet the delegates and representatives of Member States and listen to what they have to say on issues of importance to their countries and their regions. The permanent membership of the Security Council and the right of veto which is the prerogative of the few should be reviewed. It is worth mentioning in this respect that the veto has been cast 279 times since the inception of the Security Council  in relation to issues most of which were of special importance to countries of the developing world. The new world order being heralded nowadays should not violate the sovereignty  territorial integrity  or independence of States nor deprive them of their right to make their own decisions. Preventive diplomacy relating to the making and maintenance of peace should proceed from a basic principle aimed  first and foremost  at the complete eradication of regional and international tension  and at seeking out and uprooting the root causes of political  social and economic conflicts so that the countries involved may live in peace and enjoy stability and prosperity. The type of preventive diplomacy that is accompanied by the use of military force must not be used against the smaller States alone. It is worth wondering here how military force can be used against countries which possess large or medium military capabilities. This is a legitimate question and we  the smaller States  should look for an answer to it that would meet our urgent concerns. If preventive diplomacy is to proceed initially from the principle of fact-finding  such fact-finding should be based on information-gathering from original sources and should avoid selectivity and hasty conclusions that could become the justification for specific actions which may well be military in nature. We in the developing world have suffered a great deal from the unfair communication of facts on issues concerning our countries  either through mass media networks or governmental and non-governmental organizations which may be active in our countries. We hope that the United Nations and its various agencies  in all cases  will act impartially and not fall prey to narrow political opportunism. In the midst of international changes  we in the Sudan are striving to spread the principles of Shura meaning consultation and participation in decision-making - and democracy  and to find a peaceful and lasting political solution to the problem of the southern Sudan. We have so far achieved considerable progress  at the Abuja talks  which took place in May this year under the auspices of President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria. We look forward with optimism and hope to the forthcoming second round of the Abuja talks  which will soon take place. We expect to reach  with the rebel movement  a final solution to the problem of the south  by the end of this year. It is our sincere hope that the peace efforts by the Sudan Government will attract the support and blessings of all friendly and fraternal States and of the international community as a whole. Allow me to mention here specifically  an important issue that weighs a lot on many minds these days  namely the issue of human rights. The protection and maintenance of human rights is a sacred obligation that all religions and human laws call for. The causes of instability and problems of security and peace are directly and organically linked to the maintenance of these rights  for individuals and for peoples alike. Therefore  it is our conviction that human rights are linked to the right of individuals and peoples to dignity  physical and mental health  the freedom to make their own decisions without diktat  the right to have access to the fruits of scientific advancement  namely progress and technology  the right to be free from poverty  disease and hunger and the right to education as well as to material and psychological stability. However  we notice that the principles of human rights  just like many other ideals  are being exploited and misused as a pretext for interference and intervention in the internal affairs of smaller States. Regardless of the claims of interference and intervention for the protection of minorities  such behaviour is  in essence  no more than using the issue of human rights as a weapon against those countries which do not submit to foreign diktat  and as a means of shrugging off moral obligations towards the developing countries. We also notice that while the lofty ideal of human rights is being wielded as weapon  its use is characterized by a double-standard. The crimes and violations by allies are ignored  while accusations of human rights violations are trumped up against those countries that do not surrender their right to independent decision-making. We notice too that certain countries have set themselves up as the self-styled protectors of human rights even though they lack any moral grounds that may qualify them for such a role. Such States give themselves the right to dictate norms of human rights according to their own cultures  customs and social conceptions  and pass judgement on others accordingly. The promotion of human rights and basic freedoms will be properly achieved  as envisaged by those who wrote the United Nations Charter  only through international cooperation and not through confrontation or coercion. The upholding and implementation of those rights within national frameworks remain within the jurisdiction and responsibility of each Government individually so long as that Government properly performs its duties towards its citizens. It is the right of all peoples to freely establish their own political and economic systems and institutions on the basis of respect for the principles of national sovereignty  self-determination and non-interference in the internal affairs of others. In this context  reference should be made to the fact that the fundamental principles of human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights embody two components that balance out each other: the first relates to the rights and basic freedoms of the individual  while the second stipulates duties of the individual towards society and State. This balance between rights and duties is important  inasmuch as its absence leads to the negation of the rights of society as a whole and to instability  especially in developing countries. We agree also with the view that the political  civil  economic  social and cultural dimensions of human rights are indivisible  and cannot be selectively denied for contingent political motives. At the same time  we reject every attempt to use the human rights issue as a precondition for the provision of economic and social assistance as this leads to the marginalization of such rights on the economic  social and cultural levels. We emphasize that development and human rights are concomitant and interdependent. Hence the need for cooperation and multilateral assistance in the implementation of social and economic development programmes in the developing countries on the basis of the fact that the right to development is a valid  legitimate right that constitutes an indivisible part of fundamental human rights. We hope that the World Conference on Human Rights that will be held next year will deal comprehensively with the issue in all its aspects. Another important issue that requires urgent attention is the situation in Somalia. The people of this sister country are victims of a bitter civil  They have suffered its ravages. Since the convening of the minisummit of the States of the Horn of Africa on humanitarian issues  those States have performed and continue to perform their duty in searching for a peaceful solution to the differences between the warring factions in the dispute in Somalia. We look forward to the support of the international community for that role in order for it to achieve the goals spelled out at the Bahr Dar meeting. We had expected the international community to recognize that role and develop it  as stability in the region is important  especially to its countries and for the welfare of its peoples which cannot be ensured without this desired stability. However  what happened instead was that a decision to send international forces to Somalia was taken  and the numbers of those forces have started to increase from one day to the next. It was our opinion that such forces should have been composed of contingents from the countries of the region itself  because we are worried that some countries from outside the region may pursue their own interests there by supporting one faction or another against the others and thereby enabling it to win the war. Stability in Somalia cannot be achieved without comprehensive national reconciliation; one faction cannot have sole power  and we hope that the faction of Mr. Ali Mahdi will come to realize this fact. Several tragic multifaceted situations continue to beset the world such as the refugee problems and the plight of displaced and homeless persons. These problems are clearly manifest in Africa and the Middle East. The Palestinian people continue to struggle and strive for the establishment of their own independent State on their own soil at a time when bilateral and multilateral negotiations are being obstructed by procedural hurdles that have held back those talks and prevented the negotiators from addressing the substance of the conflict. The new Israeli Government has not yet proved its serious intent or demonstrated the political will to restore the rights of the Palestinian people and consequently restore peace and security to this sensitive region of the world. We consider that the convening of an international conference on the Palestinian question under full United Nations supervision is the only viable alternative. We further believe that the attempts being made with the aim of fragmenting the territorial integrity of Iraq are negative acts and examples of the unjust improper application of international norms. Moreover  those attempts will eventually jeopardize the balance of power in the region  ensure absolute Israeli hegemony and open wide the doors to Israel's belligerent and expansionist intentions which aim at ingathering all the Jews of the world in a greater Israel. Another human tragedy that needs close attention is the question of the Muslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina who are being subjected to genocide and liquidation under the very noses of those who call for the preservation of human rights and the protection of minorities. This situation  in our view  is the result of ancient and anachronistic ethnic and religious hatreds which should have disappeared by now. All countries agree that the massacres  genocide  detentions and summary executions that are taking place there have no precedent other than what took place in the days of the Second World War. While the changes that swept over the countries of Eastern Europe have resulted in the emergence of new republics  we would have hoped that  in due course  those republics were going to join the world community of independent States and ensure the enjoyment to the full  by a'l their peoples  of religious and cultural freedoms. The appeasement of a belligerent majority is a clear case of bias in favour of the creed and cultural affiliations of that majority as opposed to the Islamic faith of a considerable number of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The actual handling of this issue has been flawed by the selectivity of the major Powers  especially the five permanent members of the Security Council. It is definitely short-sighted to deal with the problem only from a limited humanitarian perspective. What the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina need above all is the preservation of their identity side by side with freedom and protection from acts of displacement and extermination. We therefore consider that the resolutions of the Security Council on this issue are inadequate because they do not address the issue in its wider political and ethical context. Proceeding from this view  the Islamic Group has condemned Security Council resolution 770 (1992). In our opinion  complete military intervention by the United Nations is the only viable solution. If this does not take place  our nagging doubts that there is a scheme to erase the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the map of Europe will only grow. In addition  the policy of depriving the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the means to defend their very existence while the Serbian aggressors continue to receive arms without any interference from the United Nations  will cast strong doubts on the integrity and neutrality of the international Organization. Recently  a minor crisis has flared up between the two sisterly States of Iran and the United  Arab Emirates over certain disputed islands. We are disturbed by the fact that that dispute has been transferred from the bilateral context to regional and international forums. This will only exacerbate the conflict. The parties that are now engaged in promoting the escalation of that dispute especially in the mass media  are trying  in fact  to aggravate tensions in the Gulf region  which has suffered the unfortunate effects of the sad events that have swept over it during the past few years. We urge most strongly the containment of this dispute which should be addressed at the bilateral level in line with the operation of the old mechanism that was agreed upon in 1971 between the two parties. The Persian Gulf area has suffered a series of wars that have obstructed its development. The present agonies of the people of Iraq under the conditions of an unjust economic blockade and the unending attempts to fragment their country's territorial integrity have resulted from disputes which  in our view  should have been settled by peaceful means within the regional framework  in order to prevent foreign interests from infiltrating the region and capitalizing on differences and disputes to serve their own strategic and economic designs. The international economic situation remains static. Indeed  its principal feature continues to be the unending deterioration of the economies of the countries of the South and the widening gap between those countries and the industrial countries. The major cause of that deterioration lies in the negative and dangerous effects on international trade of the drop in exports of the developing countries as a result of the deterioration of prices of their primary commodity exports to the industrial countries. The horrendous negative effects of the debt crisis have been aggravated to the point where they not only threaten the prospects of economic and social development of the developing countries but also the very existence of those countries. It is important at this point to mention the failure of the industrial countries to honour their commitments  as embodied in international treaties and strategies pertaining to the flow of development assistance to the developing countries  and particularly in implementing the resolutions embodied in the the international strategy for the decade of the 1980s  which called for allocating 0.7% of their gross national income to official assistance to the developing countries. Instead of implementing those resolutions  the developed countries have blocked every attempt to adopt a new strategy for the decade of the 1990s. Furthermore  the industrial countries have failed to implement the programme for the 1990s  which was adopted in favour of the least developed countries in the 1990 Paris Conference. This. failure has caused a grave setback to the economic and social development of the least developed countries. Africa  with its feeble infrastructures  is the continent that has been most affected by that imbalance in the world economic situation. It is the continent that suffers most  because of the considerably diminished flow of economic assistance and investment and the imposition on its countries of unjust conditions that are not imposed upon the other groupings of the developing world. Moreover  the attempts to destabilize some regions of the continent aim  in our view.- at creating a geopolitical climate that would be compatible with the strategies of certain major Powers. We all know the potentials of Africa  a continent with a great wealth of untapped human and natural resources. The real challenge that now faces the international community is narrowing of the ever-widening gap between the wealthy countries of the North and the poor countries of the South. It is that gap which is the real threat to world peace and security. The debt crisis is one of the products of the present international economic order. It is a phenomenon that resulted. essentially  from the structural imbalance of that order  and its failure to generate an appropriate developmental climate. We have an unshakable belief in the necessary collective interdependency and the organic interrelatedness of the international economic order  if it is to be an order whose aim is to mutually benefit all mankind. This cannot be the case  however  unless comprehensive and integrated solutions are found to the existing problems on the basis of equality  justice and interdependency. The dialogue required for the achievement of that objective cannot take place without the political will  courage  wisdom and far-sightedness of all concerned. In conclusion  we should like to express our absolute conviction regarding the necessity of collective action in the current period of detente in international relations. That means  in our view  developing the activities of all the organs of the United Nations and giving those organs the required importance. In order to reach that objective  we need to cooperate and work together  hand in hand. May Allah lead us to our noble objectives and grant us the vision to see them clearly. "
"138",6130,"SEN",47,1992,"The United Nations would appear today to be the ideal forum for seeking and identifying solutions to the problems of all kinds that are assailing the world. It is here that modern history is being woven and it is here that ideas are expressed that plant the seeds of the future. That is both because the United Nations brings together almost every country and because the ideas on which it is based and the principles which guide it arise from our most generous feelings the sense that we belong to the same humanity and are duty bound to preserve it. Thus  it is always with hope that I speak before the Assembly. Today  moreover  I am speaking on behalf of Africa and the Islamic Ummah. Speaking on behalf of so many peoples is a heavy responsibility indeed  but one that is also full of exaltation because of the hopes that underlie it. I am even happier to bear that responsibility because the choice of you  Mr. President  to guide the work of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is a certain guarantee that it will take place smoothly and successfully  for  in addition to your distinguished qualities as a diplomat  you come from a country whose commitment to the triumph of the common ideals of the nations gathered together here has never been in doubt. Therefore  from the bottom of my heart I address my warmest congratulations to you. I wish you to know also  and in particular  that in carrying out your important and sensitive mission you can always count on the cooperation of the Senegalese delegation and of all those on whose behalf I speak at this session. To your predecessor  Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  we pay a well-deserved tribute for his outstanding guidance of the deliberations of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. For anyone who knows the great qualities of his people  there is nothing surprising in that. As to the Secretary-General  I am pleased to say once again how satisfied we are at seeing him occupy this prestigious post. Our fraternal and friendly support will always be with him in his efforts to ensure that the United Nations plays the full role given it by the Charter and shoulders all the responsibilities that derive from that Charter. Speaking of the role and responsibilities of the United Nations  I cannot fail to emphasize the very great hopes that his election has aroused in us Africans. Like our Arab brothers and all the peoples of the countries members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  we viewed his election as concrete proof of the universality of the United Nations. In fact  it constitutes a confirmation  following upon the mandates assumed by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  another national of a developing country. All our best wishes are with the Secretary-General. Thanks to the atmosphere of detente prevailing today in international relations  with the end of the cold war and of ideological tensions  the credibility and image of our Organization have been greatly strengthened. For some time now the United Nations has been demonstrating its effectiveness  in particular through the tangible results in the area of peace-keeping. It has also made significant progress in the slowing down of the arms race. In a word  what was unimaginable yesterday is now a part of everyday life  and in referring to it we now speak of a ""new world order"". The expression is rather explicit  because for all of us it bears upon the strengthening of international security and the guarantee of stability of international relations. But the reality contained within it must also mean  for the developing countries  a greater awareness of the aspirations of their peoples to well-being. In view of what is going on around us  we are still far from that situation. Indeed  suffering and injustice are still the daily lot of millions of men and women in several regions. What is even worse at this time of over-abundance  when one thinks about the milk and grain surpluses  people continue to die of hunger because they do not have the very strict minimum they need. Similarly  people are still dying of diseases which medical progress has now made it possible to cure. Moreover  from recovery plans to adjustment programmes  the economies of many countries have lost their structure and become anaemic  and their Governments find themselves virtually powerless. The case of Africa  in this regard  is tragically instructive. Its economic growth rates have remained at their lowest in proportion to population growth; investments are rarely seen and infrastructure needs are the most significant. Here is a continent which is rich in minerals and mining resources but in which paradoxically most of the poorest countries are to be found. These sorry records are explained in part  by the youth of the countries that make up Africa. But they are the result  above all  of its raw materials and other products being sold at prices fixed outside the continent and most of the time in total disregard of its interests. This situation is all the more worrying because it has persisted I would even say worsened despite the efforts of African leaders to improve it  especially since the beginning of the 1980s. Thus  in 1986  when I was Acting President of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  I was mandated to appeal to the United Nations to deal with our specific problems in a special way. Reacting positively  the United Nations convened a special session of the General Assembly  which adopted the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990 (UNPAAERD). This document gave rise to the greatest hope because it was the fruit of unprecedented joint effort. It was  theoretically  a true solidarity pact. I say ""pact"" because Africa had committed itself to set up the necessary structures for launching autonomous long-term socio- economic growth and development programmes. The international community for its part agreed to help Africa achieve that goal. This dual commitment was expressly entered into in UNPAAERD  which made it clear in particular that the international community would spare no effort to provide sufficient resources to support and complement the development efforts of Africa. That was clear. Unfortunately  we must recognize that  while the African countries took the measures agreed upon  the same cannot be said of the international community as a whole  even if some countries of the North had a friendly and understanding attitude in our regard. Will the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADA) be treated differently  more generously? Undoubtedly it will be  if it is applied  because its commitments are firm and precise  and follow-up  monitoring and assessment mechanisms have been provided  thanks to which the two parties will be able to work together on a permanent basis. Thus  they will be able together and at regular and short intervals to ensure respect for the commitments agreed upon. It is perhaps these frequent meetings which were missing in the implementation process of UNPAAERD. I hope that that is the only explanation for the modest results of that document. But for the time being  I note that Africa is prey to the same difficulties  some of which have even worsened. That is the case with its external debt  the repayment of which consumes the bulk of the meagre financial resources left to Africa owing to worsening terms of trade. Since lending countries are slow in agreeing to hold an international conference devoted to this problem  we are making an urgent appeal to all States and all international financial institutions so that together we can explore other ways to solve the problem. Otherwise  it will be illusory to expect the African countries to give all due attention to problems of common interest. Quite naturally  they will devote their energies  on a priority basis  to the struggle for the survival of their peoples. The persistence of the African debt problem could even have other negative and more immediate consequences; population movement from the South to the countries of the North have already shown that this risk exists. To this already grim picture we must add the increasingly evident precariousness of the African environment  which is illustrated by the devastating drought which has hit the southern part of the continent  after having wreaked on the Sahel the damage of which we are all aware. We must also add to this the lightning spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)  along with other diseases which have disappeared elsewhere  and the number of hotbeds of tension which already exist  not to mention those which may yet arise. In this respect  it is South Africa which first comes to mind. None the less  one would have thought a few months ago that the present session would be the opportunity for the international community to rejoice over the irreversible changes since the advent of President Frederick De Klerk. But what do we see today  over and above the formal abrogation - I was going to say theoretical abrogation of the apartheid laws? Blacks still do not have the same rights as the rest of South African society  and violence has been omnipresent in recent months  sometimes achieving proportions which cast doubt upon the willingness of the South African Government to change. The continuation of such an atmosphere would be a serious threat to the progress we have all welcomed. That is why at the twenty-eighth regular summit meeting of the OAU  held at Dakar  it was felt necessary to take the matter to the Security Council. In my capacity as Acting President of that pan-African organization  I should like  on behalf of the continent  to express my sincerest thanks to the members of this organ of our universal Organization for the diligence and sense of solidarity with which they responded to our appeal by adopting Security Council resolution 765 (1992)  which invites the South African authorities to take the appropriate measures to end the violence. I also wish to avail myself of this opportunity to repeat our commitment to a negotiated solution in South Africa and the hope generated by the recent Mandela-De Klerk summit meeting. We hope that the talks to be resumed within the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) after that meeting will make it possible speedily to harmonize the positions of the parties and make irreversible the resolute march of South Africa towards a non-racial  democratic and united society. The civil war in Liberia is another source of concern for Africa. It is all the more worrying since it has continued even after a framework for a peaceful settlement had been drawn up by the countries in the subregion. As the Head of State of a country member of the Committee of Five of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) that was set up to resolve the crisis  I can testify to the fact that this framework was conceived with the sole concern of helping our Liberian brothers regain peace. After several meetings  we adopted it with the agreement of all of the parties. But the bitter fact remains that the horizon is dark because the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (EC0M0G)  the centre-piece of the agreed-upon arrangement  does not have the means for its peace mission. That is why  while thanking those who have already given us their support  I should like to ask the United Nations to provide increased assistance. In the absence of such a gesture  we risk seeing the Liberian crises continue. It is already a serious threat to the stability of the West African subregion  and in human terms it is a catastrophe with lasting consequences. I now come to the most absurd and perhaps most devastating tragedy Africa has known in recent years. I refer to the civil war in Somalia. This country  once so welcoming  today is a hell on earth. It is the picture of anarchy  of intolerance in all its forms  of violence  and of the failure of man before his destiny. Senegal  for its part  is doing everything in its power to help end this tragedy which  should it persist  would run the risk of sounding the death knell of the very existence of Somalia. It is doing so for humanitarian reasons  for reasons of African solidarity and  in brief  for reasons of common sense. It is also doing so in its capacity as a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)  the OAU and the United Nations. Let me take this opportunity to note that  together with the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the League of Arab States  our organization is already engaged in significant efforts for Somalia. But the situation there is so grave that we must give it high priority in the days and weeks ahead if we are not to witness the genocide of a people through the death of its children. I appeal also to non-governmental organizations; I encourage them to continue their generous activities in Somalia. The parties to the conflict must understand that the interest of the Somali people lies in the restoration of peace  and that rivalries that sacrifice human lives by the thousand can only result in their claims becoming pointless. What I would truly like to see is an international conference on Somalia. I therefore solemnly propose that such a meeting take place as soon as possible in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations  the OAU  the League of Arab States  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the European Community. The goal would be to put a rapid end to the armed confrontation and define a framework for a peaceful settlement of the crisis acceptable to all parties. The United Nations would take the initiative here  but the modalities of the meeting would be defined among all the organizers  who would also jointly agree on the list of participants. For my part  I should be represented there both as current Chairman of the OAU and as President of the sixth Islamic summit. But I cannot stress too forcefully that while awaiting that conference  for which we earnestly wish  the international community must continue to help the victims of the confrontations imposed upon the Somali people by armed factions. In particular  it should do everything it can to ensure that the arms embargo imposed in Security Council resolution 733 (1992) of 23 January 1992 is strictly observed  and should take every other possible initiative to put an end to the violence and the suffering. That wish of the OAU is shared by the Organization of the Islamic Conference  of which Somalia is a member. My rehearsal of tensions in Africa would be incomplete without a reference to Western Sahara. I wholeheartedly wish for a settlement to that matter; this could be reached quickly within the framework defined by the OAU. Nor can I omit to mention the fragile peace in Angola and elsewhere on the continent. Speaking of peace  I cannot fail to reiterate how much the peoples I represent here cherish peace. In our societies  everything boils down to the human being; peace is naturally one of the reference values. That was one of the observations of the sixth summit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. In Africa  the Heads of State or Government of the States members of the OAU proved their commitment to peace by deciding at the most recent summit  held at Dakar  to establish a mechanism for preventing  managing and settling conflicts. That mechanism is intended to respond to Africa's desire for the means to prevent conflicts  through an ongoing analysis of situations  putting an end to those that persist in spite of our efforts. Africa is thus in step with United Nations concerns on the maintenance of peace  as set out by the Secretary-General in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). That is because the Secretary-General's vision of peace is reflected today in the determination resolutely to address the continent's political and economic problems. Without a doubt  this is a manifestation of Africa's self-confidence  and proves that our continent's de facto marginalization has not paralysed it. On the contrary  its self-confidence has never been disconnected from the spread of multiparty democracy; indeed  without it  the current trends would certainly not be so clear. Democracy has made great progress in Africa in recent months. Authoritarian regimes have yielded to democratically elected Governments; everywhere  confrontation is yielding to joint efforts and bullets to ballots. Our efforts at integration derive also from our determination to take our destiny in our own hands and is an expression of our self-confidence. The same holds true for the way in which we are addressing environmental problems and for our determination not to miss the energy revolution that is appearing on the horizon. It is significant that  with respect to our commitment in that sphere  we have placed our bets on solar energy. It is abundant in our countries and can reconcile the need for healthy environment with that for development. If these efforts can be pursued and if their orientation can be maintained - and we are determined that they should be Africa will soon be in a position to overcome its present situation. But again: to achieve the expected effects we must have consistent support from the international community. We have seen this with the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development. We know too that the solution or prevention of conflicts in Africa will be possible only if arms supplies to belligerents and other forms of outside intervention are halted. Everyone knows that democracy in Africa can be consolidated only if it is followed by progress towards  inter alia  economic growth based on a rationalization of development efforts. This requires improved relations within Africa  adequate infrastructure  and the possibility for African countries to ensure that their products can reach northern markets at profitable prices. Although Africa is certainly the continent most severely affected by economic crisis  war and other conflicts  we have no monopoly on these evils: other peoples are suffering too  and we stand in solidarity with them. That is why  although I have spoken at some length about Africa  I must not neglect the tragedies being played out elsewhere. I am far from indifferent to the economic difficulties of Latin America like ours  caused in large part by unfair international economic relations to the need to consolidate peace in Cambodia through scrupulous respect for the Paris agreements  and to the need for Afghanistan to take the path of national reconciliation. We in Africa are also concerned about the situation in some of the former Soviet republics and in the former Yugoslavia  as well as about the unacceptable state of affairs that continues to be imposed on the Palestinian people. On Bosnia and Herzegovina  we approve of the initiatives to ease the suffering of the population  to halt the violence  and to put an end to what appears to be an attempt at ""ethnic cleansing"". As President of the sixth Islamic summit  I sent a representative to the recent London Conference on the former Yugoslavia. I shall continue to associate myself with all steps in that direction  and I call on the United Nations to continue  even increase  its efforts. With respect to the question of Palestine  while we welcome the positive developments in the way it is being handled in the context of the ongoing peace process under the sponsorship of the United States of America and Russia  we must observe that the process is far from meeting our expectations. But there is reason to hope that with the new Israeli  Government significant progress will be achieved and that the heroic Palestinian people will soon be free  under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization  to exercise its inalienable rights. We call on the Israeli Government to show realism and political courage  and we urge all parties to have a sense of history. It is only in that way that peace can be restored and that the Arab world and Israel can draw upon their rich common heritage and their vast economic potential. To face these challenges and realize the potential that is present despite all the problems  we need greater solidarity  both among people and among nations. I am thinking of a ""general agreement on solidarity"". As distinct from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  this moral contract would make possible the effective implementation of all the provisions of the United Nations Charter. This presupposes awareness that we all share the same future and that we agree to bear an equal interest in the maintenance of peace  the promotion of human rights and democracy both nationally and worldwide  the struggle against poverty and the protection of the environment. There is no lack of opportunity: let us begin at this session of the General Assembly. Clearly  this would be the best way to move towards the new world order to which we all aspire. To be sure  with respect to the maintenance of peace  the United Nations to which we pay an enthusiastic tribute - under the dynamic leadership of the Secretary-General is making notable efforts to respond to the many demands upon it. To be sure  in the Middle East  in the rest of Asia  in Africa and in Europe  United Nations peace-keeping forces  in most of which my country is proud to participate  are carrying out their missions courageously  loyally and effectively  and for the most part to the great satisfaction of the peoples of those regions. We must  however  recognize that this universal Organization is not equally successful everywhere its intervention is desired and necessary. Often this is because of the Charter requirement that regional organizations play the primary role in the settlement of regional disputes  but we must realize that their effectiveness is limited in the case of armed confrontation because they do not have the means required for peace-keeping operations. I believe that fidelity to the spirit of the Charter in this regard requires the establishment and operation of a system of co-operation between the United Nations and the regional organizations so that they may benefit from appropriate technical and financial assistance and thus can become more involved in the management and settlement of regional conflicts. I am happy to note that this is the thrust of the report of the Secretary-General entitled ""Agenda for peace"". In any case  this is what should flow from our concern to preserve our collective security. That is clear militarily  but it is also increasingly true with regard to the other aspects of security. No one is unaware that those aspects are equally important. Thus the strong solidarity I have been advocating  through the ""general agreement on solidarity""  presupposes also the resumption of the North-South dialogue. More exactly  it will be a question of engagement in a new dialogue between the developed and the developing countries. I say ""new"" because the dialogue would be imbued with the spirit of partnership and agreement to joint responsibility in facing common challenges: challenges involved in economic and trade problems as well as environment and health. The General Assembly could ask the Secretary-General to make concrete proposals along those lines at its next session. I am among those who believe dialogue would be easier if the solidarity we are seeking to promote were indeed effective at the regional level  and it will be necessary for that to be taken into account in the efforts under way in the regional groups. That is one of the reasons why Senegal has made the achievement of African integration  as advocated in the Treaty setting up the African Economic Community  one of its main priorities in matters of foreign policy. That explains our commitment to the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). But a reminder is needed here. The OIC is not a religious organization. Its objective is to organize solidarity among its member States  whose peoples are united by the same faith and have the same concerns. It already is a very good tool for political and cultural co-operation  and it is our ambition to make it an effective instrument for economic  commercial and technical co-operation. The Dakar Summit of last December was a turning-point in this respect. Of the groups that must have our attention in the framework of the rebalancing of international economic relations  I must mention the Summit Group for Consultation and the South-South Co-operation Group  the so-called Group of 15  whose goal is to make South-South co-operation effective through the drawing up and implementation of specific projects. But I hasten to make it clear that that group is not a closed club; indeed  everything that is discussed there is at the disposal of the other developing countries; nor does it claim to be a spokesman for the entire South. However  I am convinced that it does constitute a framework for the definition of the common concerns of the countries of the South with regard to specific questions  and for the expression of their views. Moreover  it has drawn up and circulated a position paper on the new world order. Returning to the North-South dialogue and to the ""general agreement on solidarity""  which should promote the dialogue while belief in it may be unrealistic  and the meetings that have taken place so far have been rather disappointing for the most part  the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro last June has given us reason for greater optimism. Indeed  while far from perfect  it worked for the taking into account  in the long term  of all the concerns and perspectives of the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that after Rio nothing is the same as before in approaching environmental problems and their interrelationship with development. What is even better  the change that has taken place thanks to a real awareness of the globalization of mankind's problems could be the dawn of the new world order. The forthcoming convening of certain international conferences gives us the opportunity to confirm and amplify on that change. I believe that the World Conference on Human Rights planned for 1993 and the International Conference on Population and Development to take place in 1994 reflect our common willingness to deal with questions that no longer know any borders. The same is true of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the World Summit on Social Development  both planned for 1995. Is it not significant that those meetings were programmed after the Rio Summit on Environment and Development  as well as the World Summit for Children? In any case  we must hope that  like their two predecessors  these other conferences will not lose sight of the need to ensure the follow-up on decisions and recommendations that would make their work fruitful. In this regard it is a pleasure for me to announce on this day  which coincides with the second anniversary of the World Summit for Children  that  in the spirit of that historic meeting  an international conference on assisting African children  organized by the Organization of African Unity with the support of UNICEF  will take place in Dakar from 25 to 27 November 1992. Our goal is to bring the international community to a point where it thinks about the special situation of African children and the difficulties facing the African countries with regard to ensuring their harmonious development  or indeed their mere survival. This situation and these problems will also be focused on in meetings to be held soon devoted to children in French-speaking countries and also within the framework of the OIC. While reflecting a real awareness of the interdependence of the world  at which we rejoice  the programme of international meetings I have just mentioned shows that much remains to be done in this vast field through joint efforts. In particular I have in mind disarmament for the benefit of development  the easing of the foreign debt burden of the developing countries  the removal of protectionist tariff barriers  the improvement of commodity prices  and the transfer of the technology and human resources necessary for development. No one denies that today our collective survival largely depends upon adequate consideration of these questions and the challenges of the environment  AIDS and drugs not to mention the problem of peace-keeping operations. Hence  it is urgent to achieve greater solidarity  to which I referred earlier. Moreover  there is a central role that the United Nations must play in dealing with these problems. There is no need to emphasize that such a role requires that this universal Organization review its methods of work and that Member States reassess the means made available to the United Nations. In Africa and within the Islamic Ummah we recognize the importance of the restructuring and other work to restore dynamism to our Organization being carried out by the Secretary-General and by such organs as the Economic and Social Council  which is intended to cope with the new burdens arising from world developments. On their behalf  I welcome the results already achieved in this regard  and I encourage a continuation of those efforts until they are successful and the goals are reached. I particularly hope that this new trend will duly take account of what are in our view two essential ideas on the one hand  peace and security are precarious without the eradication of poverty and misery and without a reduction of the gap separating the North and the South; on the other hand  efforts towards effectiveness should not sacrifice the democratic spirit by which the universality of the United Nations is maintained. Moreover  the Tenth Conference of the Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement  which was just held successfully in Jakarta  bore the stamp of renewal in continuity and achieved considerable progress in reinforcing that trend. Given the scores of challenges and the ever stronger commitment of the non-governmental organizations working alongside Governments to meet those challenges  I would add the need to take into account the recommendations of those organizations. I am thinking even that we could study the possibility. through the efforts of the Secretary-General  of requiring such recommendations to be taken into account in specific fields. I have had the signal honour to address you on behalf of various peoples some of which are separated by thousands of kilometres. But these peoples share with my country Senegal the same faith in human solidarity  the same hope for a better tomorrow  even the same goals. United in their diversity  these peoples are calling for justice where it is trampled and peace wherever it is threatened. They are calling for the coming of a world in which hunger  intolerance and unfairness have disappeared. These peoples call upon you to act together  to innovate and to do so without delay. "
"139",6177,"SGP",47,1992,"In 1989  the year in which the Berlin Wall fell and the cold war came to an end  there were 159 Member States represented in this Hall. Today  three years later  there are 179  an increase of 20. Will this trend continue? If so  there could be 200 Member States represented in this Hall when we meet here again in 1995. Will these new countries come from Africa  Asia  Europe or the Americas? And will the birth pangs of these new States be as traumatic as those of some our newer Members  like Croatia  Slovenia  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Moldova and Georgia? Or will they emerge peacefully? I begin my statement with these questions because I believe that our first task at this session is to rid ourselves of the euphoria that many of us here experienced when the cold war ended. From the tragic experience of Kuwait to the continuing anguish of the former Yugoslavs  we are seeing the re-emergence of forces that we thought had been swept away by forces of modernization. Ghosts which had been sleeping for decades have awakened to haunt us. How many more will awaken in the years to come? This session clearly needs to be one of sober reflection. In this regard I am pleased that we have elected Ambassador Ganev of Bulgaria to guide our deliberations. This reflects the confidence of Member States in his leadership abilities. Bulgaria's geographical location gives it a unique insight into the problems that we are facing. I should also like to place on record our appreciation of the wise leadership and guidance provided by our President's predecessor  Ambassador Samir Shihabi. In addition  we wish to place on record our appreciation to Mr. Perez de Cuellar for his 10 years of dedicated and exemplary service as Secretary-General. Let me also congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his wise and dynamic stewardship of the United Nations in his first year in office. There can no longer be any doubt that the cold war  even though it terrified many of us in this Hall  effectively froze or suppressed many tribal  religious  ethnic and cultural divisions. The thawing of the cold war has led to their re-emergence. I need only to cite some obvious recent examples. Even as we speak  conflicts are raging between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh  and there are conflicts in Moldova  Georgia and Afghanistan. Somalia is splintering; the former Yugoslavia has descended into tribal warfare. The world has still not recovered from the shock of the atrocities and the blatant disregard of basic humanitarian principles in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the name of ""ethnic cleansing""  which we condemn as an abhorrent practice. In this setting it is appropriate and timely that the Secretary-General has produced his report ""An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping"" (A/47/277). Not every United Nations Member will agree with its analysis. Nor will all the recommendations be universally endorsed. But it is a far-reaching document with concrete proposals for the maintenance of international peace and security. It also contains the Secretary-General's recommendations on ways to strengthen and make more efficient the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-building. We should congratulate the Secretary-General and his staff on putting together a comprehensive and thoughtful paper that raises the issues that Member States need to address. There is much in there for us to ruminate on but there is also room for us to add ideas to it. For example  the report  for obvious reasons  refrains from trying to apportion blame or investigate the causes of the recent conflicts. This should be the job of Member States. We need to be clear in our minds whether the explosion of new States in recent years is a natural and welcome development  something akin to what we saw in the era of decolonization  or whether it is a reflection of a state of disorder in the structures of human society that we have created in the twentieth century. Or is it the case  as the ""Agenda for Peace"" suggests  that the ""deepest causes of conflict"" are: ""economic despair  social injustice and political oppression"" (A/47/277  para. 15)? We need to be clear in our minds about what is happening because this will in turn define the mission that we will entrust to the United Nations: when a conflict breaks out within a State should the mission of the United Nations be to resolve the conflict and peacefully reunite the factions as in Angola and El Salvador or should the mission of the United Nations be to facilitate a peaceful division of the country as in Yugoslavia? These are not theoretical questions. These are practical questions that United Nations peace-keepers confront on a day-to-day basis in the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia.  Lest I be misunderstood  let me stress that I welcome the new Member States that have joined the United Nations this year: Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. I believe that they would agree with me that if more new Member States are going to join us we should ensure that they emerge peacefully and not through war and conflict. The ""Agenda for Peace"" also makes it clear that the functions of United Nations peace-keepers have gone far beyond their usual mandate. In the past United Nations peace-keepers were traditionally sent in after a peace agreement had been worked out between the warring parties. Today United Nations forces are involved in a variety of tasks ranging from election-monitoring to inspection of nuclear installations. The range of functions is expected to increase. As the ""Agenda for Peace"" points out  these will include preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-building. Let me also state the points of agreement that I have with the report. First  I agree that the United Nations should play a more proactive role in preventive diplomacy. As the report states: ""... preventive diplomacy requires measures to create confidence; it needs early warning based on information gathering and informal or formal fact-finding; it may also involve preventive deployment and  in some situations  demilitarized zones."" (A/47/277  para. 23) Secondly  I also agree that the Security Council can now play a more active role because  as the report states: ""With greater unity has come leverage and persuasive power to lead hostile parties towards negotiations."" (A/47/277  para. 35) Thirdly  I agree that the United Nations should work in concert with regional groupings. I believe that the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) would be happy to do so. The endorsement by the United Nations of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation  signed in Bali  Indonesia  in 1976 and recently acceded to by Laos and Viet Nam  could make it a model for other regions to emulate. Having imposed these significant new burdens on the United Nations it is absurd that Member States  especially the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council  are depriving the United Nations of the funds needed to carry out these operations. Unpaid arrears for United Nations peace-keeping operations now amount to $800 million. They are likely to rise as the cost of peace-keeping operations for this year alone is likely to reach $3 billion. Some of the biggest debtors of the United Nations come from countries of the North. It would be tragic for countries of the North to assume that they are immune from the political and economic travails of the South. Yugoslavia has demonstrated that these problems can explode at their doorsteps. The modern technology spun by the developed countries has made our world into a global village in the truest sense of the word. No villager can ignore a fire in the home of his fellow villager  for if he does his own home could be burnt. We saw this clearly at the Rio de Janeiro Summit earlier this year. The countries of the North called upon the countries of the South to restrain their deforestation  their production of chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs) and their pollutive development  for they were concerned that the effects of these activities in the South would wander into their homes. Yet while they expect the relatively impoverished countries of the South to make valiant sacrifices  they are not prepared to make equal sacrifices in their relatively affluent lifestyles. Given these difficulties  it is remarkable that the Rio Summit reached a consensus on Agenda 21. We in the General Assembly should endorse the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 and adopt a good decision to establish a high-level commission on sustainable development. The momentum achieved in Rio de Janeiro has to be maintained and followed up. To address these environmental questions squarely  the world also needs to reinvigorate the global economy. We must convince the countries of the North that if they want the South to pay greater heed to their concerns on the global environment  they must in turn push the global economy forward by successfully completing the Uruguay Round as soon as possible. Instead of doing this  the countries of the North are concentrating on regional integration. Whatever the fate of the Maastricht Treaty  an integrated single European market will be in place by January 1993  bolstered by an expanded agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries that would bring about greater European Community-EFTA economic co-operation known as the European Economic Area (EEA). The North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) is about to be formed. If these arrangements benefit only the countries of the North  with no perceived benefits to the South  the South is unlikely to cooperate with the North on environmental issues. Fortunately  the South has not been standing still. A major economic revolution is also taking place there  affecting the lives of billions of people  especially in large nations such as China  India  Pakistan and Indonesia. If present trends continue  by the year 2000 the ASEAN countries and the Asian newly industrializing economies will have a gross domestic product (GDP) of $3.3 trillion  two thirds of the United States 1990 GDP or half of the European Community 1990 GDP. China could double its gross national product (GNP) within this decade. Clearly  some parts of the South are going to experience explosive economic growth. Except for a few which still cling to the virtues of the command economy  practically every country in the world now realizes that it has to introduce economic reforms. The old economic systems with their manifest inefficiencies and inadequacies that hindered economic growth had to be discarded. Except for a few  all States are working to introduce the market-economy system. But such adjustment to open economic competition is not without sacrifices and great political costs. The transitional economies have experienced great economic difficulties and dislocations in their initial periods of adjustment. The North should see that it is in its interest to help these countries by fighting protectionism. With such support  the developing countries should be able to pull off this economic transition successfully. If this massive economic revolution in the South succeeds  the world will experience a rising tide that will lift all of humankind those in the South and those in the North. It is also likely that this rising tide would help extinguish the flames of tribal and ethnic discord that have erupted around the globe. South-East Asia has sometimes been called ""the Balkans of Asia"". Despite this  the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have already experienced two decades of peace and economic development. Through regional cooperation in ASEAN and the concentration of national energies on economic development  the ASEAN region has become the most peaceful and prosperous part of the third world. There is no reason why this ASEAN experience cannot be duplicated in the rest of the world. I hope that this session of the General Assembly will give some thought to this as it searches for solutions to the ongoing tragedies we are now witnessing. "
"140",6210,"SLB",47,1992,"It is an honour and privilege for me to address this forty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. On behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands  I should like to express our sincere congratulations to you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the Assembly. I am confident that under your able leadership much will be achieved. I should also like to convey our sincere thanks and appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  for his outstanding leadership during the forty-sixth session. Solomon Islands joins the United Nations community in congratulating and welcoming Mr. Boutros-Ghali  our new Secretary-General. Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indeed an important and challenging task ahead. I assure the Secretary-General of my Government's continued support and cooperation. Much has happened since the last session of the General Assembly. Like the rest of the world community  Solomon Islands has viewed with interest the political developments in Eastern Europe since the latter half of 1991. Self-determination has certainly taken its course. The former republics and States of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have now gained their freedom to govern and pursue their own destinies. We observe with concern  however  that these changes have had some negative results. It is worth noting that as a result of these changes a number of former republics and States have now become Members of this world body. In the same spirit as previous speakers  Solomon Islands would like to congratulate the newly independent States of Georgia  Slovenia  Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The presence of those countries with us in this world forum not only binds us closely  but brings home a message of unity  hope and peace. Despite this message  Solomon Islands has learned with dismay about the recent killings of the civilian population and United Nations personnel in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We condemn this atrocious act. In this connection  Solomon Islands fully supports the various measures undertaken by the United Nations. I now turn to the Middle East. Solomon Islands would like to register its recognition of the countries which have played a prominent role in the Middle East peace initiative. We appreciate the complexities of the conflict and acknowledge the initiatives taken by the parties involved to find a peaceful and lasting solution. Solomon Islands urges those with the necessary resources and the will to do so  to continue to play a mediating and supportive role in this process. In this context  Solomon Islands would like to raise the questions where and how the United Nations can best play its role in facilitating this effort. Given the emerging trend towards peace  Solomon Islands calls on the United Nations to be both sensitive and responsive in adopting resolutions. We look forward to more positive participation by the United Nations in this regard. We should like to highlight issues that are of concern closer to home  the South Pacific. As the current Chairman of the South Pacific Forum  Solomon Islands has an obligation to convey to this body the aspirations and concerns of the region. At the twenty-third meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Solomon Islands i 1 July this year  a number of issues of concern to the region were discussed. These included environmental  trade and economic  political and security issues. The South Pacific region is unique because the marine environment is an integral part of our existence. Our people  perhaps more than others around the globe  depend on the sea  the land  the rivers and the forests for their immediate livelihood. But poor development planning and global environmental problems  such as climate change and the associated raising of the sea level  are becoming a threat to our resources and aspirations. For this reason  our region places environmental issues high on our agenda. Solomon Islands fully recognizes the important outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  including the Rio de Janeiro Declaration  Agenda 21  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  the Convention on Biological Diversity and the statement of principles on forests. We also endorse the concept of sustainable development  in which environmental protection constitutes an integral part of the development process. We are concerned  however  that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has not sufficiently addressed the issue of global warming. We therefore earnestly urge the early commencement of the negotiations on protocols to implement and elaborate upon the Convention and we humbly request that this be treated as a matter of urgency. Solomon Islands welcomes the decision of France to suspend its nuclear testing in our region. The suspension has led to an improvement in the relations between France and the countries in the region. It is hoped that France will endeavour to cease nuclear testing activities in the South Pacific for all time. Solomon Islands believes that environmental education and the need to create public awareness of environmental and related issues should form the foundation for an implementation strategy for Agenda 21. My Government is convinced that without educating the youth of today  who will be the adults of tomorrow  we will merely by paying lip-service to these conventions. declarations and principles on environment. In other words  sustainable development of the environment and its protection demand relevant and cost-effective educational programmes aimed at both the formal and the non-formal sectors of our education systems. As a step towards implementing Agenda 21  the primary and secondary curriculums in Solomon Islands are being reviewed with a view to introducing and improving the quality of environmental science education in schools. While we might have the initiative and the motivation to enhance environmental education programmes  the success of these undertakings is contingent on financial and technical assistance from the richer nations. It was heartening to hear  during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Brazil  that developed countries have committed themselves to providing ""new and additional"" financial assistance to enable developing countries to meet their obligations as stipulated under the conventions. On economic and trade matters  Solomon Islands recognizes the adverse impact which the global macro-economic trends have on its economy  which is both open to  and susceptible to  external change. We realize that while the initiative to begin economic reforms must come from the country itself  regional and international co-operation in such efforts is also very vital. Solomon Islands is at present pursuing a programme of structural adjustment. This programme emphasizes  first  active and effective private-sector participation; secondly  sustainable utilization of both human and natural resources; thirdly  privatization of government-owned companies; and fourthly  streamlining of the public service within the government. Being small  however  Solomon Islands cannot pursue such a programme effectively on its own. Success must depend on strategic regional development planning. proper coordination of development programmes  and the mobilization of resources to meet the needs. It also depends on the willingness and the commitment of those with financial resources to be involved. In view of these reforms  it is our sincere hope that the international financial institutions and donor countries will support our efforts to achieve our goals and objectives. The vulnerability of small island countries to external and internal security threats is not a new issue in this forum. It has been a major subject of extensive discussion and debate over the past years. We are raising the issue again because  despite the end of the cold war  there has been little improvement in the situation in our region. Undesirable  criminal and atrocious activities and behaviour  both from within and outside the region  continue to threaten the sovereignty  security and economic integrity of the South Pacific countries. At the twenty-third meeting of the South Pacific Forum in Honiara  Solomon Islands  in July 1992  the Forum agreed on a Declaration on Law Enforcement Cooperation. This Declaration identifies priority areas and establishes a framework within which security activities are to be pursued. But these undesirable activities cannot be addressed at the regional level alone.  For the long-term peace and stability of the South Pacific region  or any other region for that matter  the involvement of and collaboration with relevant international agencies is vital. On decolonization  the Solomon Islands notes with appreciation the positive measures pursued in New Caledonia by the French authorities in the implementation of the Matignon Accord. We encourage a continuing dialogue among all political parties in the territory. This is to ensure that self-determination consistent with the principles and practices of the United Nations Charter  in a framework within which all options  including that of independence  is achieved. We encourage regular contacts and interactions by the Kanaks and other New Caledonians with their South Pacific neighbours to give them courage and confidence as they prepare themselves to take on greater roles in their affairs. As a small nation  Solomon Islands sees the United Nations system as an effective insurance framework for our peace and security  fully realizing  of course  that we have no military forces or military hardware. To this important extent  we hail with gratification the Secretary-General's ""Agenda for Peace""  which highlights preventive diplomacy  peace-keeping  peacemaking and peace-building as a fresh challenge to our Organization in the future. We recognize these measures as they are defined in his report to be worthy of the attention of all Member States. To conclude  may I on behalf of the Government and people of Solomon Islands thank the United Nations for its continued interest and assistance in the development of our country. I should like to place on record my Government's appreciation to the United Nations and the United Nations Missions in New York for their tributes and messages of condolence in honour of our former Permanent Representative to the United Nations  the late Mr. Francis Bugotu. "
"141",6256,"SLE",47,1992,"It is with a deep sense of humility that I ascend this rostrum and bring the greetings and best wishes of the people of Sierra Leone as we approach the close of one of the most momentous years in our recent history. Permit me to convey to you. Sir  warm felicitations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election is a tribute to your country and a testimony to its faith in this Organization and all that it stands for. I wish you success in the performance of your duties. The year 1992 has witnessed the accession to membership of our Organization of a record number of States  13  thus bringing closer the attainment of the goal of universality envisaged in the Charter. To all these new Members  Sierra Leone extends a warm hand of welcome and friendship  feeling sure that together we shall cooperate in forging a new era of peace and progress and a better life for all the peoples of the world. Since Sierra Leone was admitted as the hundredth Member of this Organization some 30 years ago  we have come to regard this Organization as the custodian of international peace and security and as a bastion for the defence  sovereignty  and territorial integrity of all States  and particularly small States such as ours. At the same time  this Organization has not failed to deploy yeoman's efforts in solving the many international problems of an economic  social  cultural  and humanitarian character which continue to plague us. In spite of all that may have been said and done  the United Nations in the course of its relatively short history has not only contributed to preventing the nightmare of a nuclear war but also made an invaluable contribution towards eliminating those other scourges that have afflicted mankind since time immemorial and continue to afflict it still. Sierra Leone is indeed very grateful for the unstinting all-round support it has received from this Organization and its specialized agencies in confronting these problems. I wish once again to pay a tribute to all those noble men and women who in the name of the United Nations and its agencies have participated in the socio-economic development of our country  in the eradication of diseases  in caring for the needs of our children and giving help and succour to our refugees and displaced persons. Sierra Leone owes a debt of gratitude to them all. Regrettably  the problems of poverty and underdevelopment have continued to have a direct bearing on our country. It is also a matter of regret that  despite the assistance received from this Organization over the years. Sierra Leone has not registered the necessary economic growth and development that should have brought about a fundamental and meaningful improvement in the standard of living of its people. The past 24 years have witnessed a decline in the socio-economic fabric of our nation  resulting in tremendous hardship and suffering for our people. Though the reasons for this are manifold and complex  in the case of our country  however  one of the principal causes has been a succession of bad Governments that conspired against our people and neglected their welfare  and that when not sharing the national wealth among themselves conspired with foreign elements to dispose of our natural resources at give-away prices  thereby depriving Sierra Leoneans of an improved standard of living and reducing them to second-class citizens in their own God-given land. Amid this nightmarish experience. Sierra Leoneans wondered what really had gone wrong with their country  endowed as it is with rich natural and human resources alike  a country that was once referred to as the ""Athens of West Africa""  given its rich educational and cultural heritage. Over the last 24 years. Sierra Leone experienced such a far-reaching decline in its socio-economic fabric that the average life expectancy of Sierra Leoneans was reduced to a mere 42 years  with one in four children dying before the age of five owing to malnutrition and other diseases; with vital surgical operations carried out in constant fear of a breakdown of the electricity supply; with teachers forced frequently to withdraw their services for non-payment of salaries and trying to eke out a living other than by teaching; with the capital city itself in perennial darkness for years because the Government had failed to make provision for electricity supply. All this led to the concomitant and inexorable decline in the national production and the standard of living of our fellow countrymen. While the external factors contributing to this decline cannot be denied  the truth of the matter is that the incompetence and malpractices of the previous Government had so permeated all facets of national life that the nation was left to drift without any sense of direction. Thus  instead of economic development  there was a national slide into poverty and economic malaise. It was as if the light had gone out of the nation's life with no one in charge to rekindle it. As if that were not enough  as members are aware  last year  as a result of the civil war which had been raging in Liberia  at a time when Liberians had turned against each other  engaging themselves in an orgy of massacre  the people of Sierra Leone opened their homes and schools to them and offered them sanctuary. In order to end the killings and consequent suffering which they had to endure  and in the absence of any semblance of government in that country  the States of the sub-region  including Sierra Leone  with great reluctance and purely on humanitarian grounds  decided to send a peace-keeping force the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to Liberia to stop the carnage and bring the fighting among the various factions to an end. It was because Sierra Leone provided a base for the ECOMOG peace-keeping force in Liberia that Mr. Charles Taylor and his band of NPFL rebels launched a premeditated and unwarranted invasion against our country. This senseless act of revenge was also motivated by the fact that Taylor had been denied the use of our territory to infiltrate arms and ammunition to prolong the conflict in Liberia. Thus  because we allowed our country to be used to bring peace to Liberia  we now have a war imposed on us. In the course of this act of perfidy  many innocent lives  including those of women and children  have been needlessly lost. The national economy has been laid to ruin  as no meaningful agricultural and mining activities could be undertaken in the areas of rebel activity. The cost of this imposed war for Sierra Leone and its people has been incalculable and agonizing. As the custodian of international peace and security  this Organization cannot sit idly by while a group of armed bandits  let loose as a result of the total breakdown of law and order in a neighbouring State  continues to engage in a campaign of terror and destabilization of the whole subregion. On behalf of the people of Sierra Leone  I strongly appeal to this body for its economic  military and diplomatic support to eliminate this cancer once and for all. If this is not done  there could be further destabilization and insecurity in the whole subregion. The Government and people of Sierra Leone expect and deserve such support  especially when facing mortal danger launched from without. We hold Charles Taylor responsible for the suffering Sierra Leoneans have had to endure as a result of his acts of murder  banditry and international lawlessness. My country need not have been left so exposed and so unprepared for such acts of aggression  our people need not have suffered such an ordeal  if only the previous government had taken its responsibilities seriously; if only the necessary material and logistical support had been provided for the armed forces to repel such aggression. The previous regime again failed to meet this challenge. Not only did the previous Government breach its social contract with the people and neglect their welfare  but it also failed to safeguard the territorial integrity of the nation. These factors impelled us  as patriots in the armed forces  to intervene in a bloodless takeover on 29 April this year and set up the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) to save our nation from further catastrophe. Herein lies the legitimacy of our action. We intervened because we saw no way out of our affliction  no future to match the sacrifice that people had been asked to make over many years. In assuming so onerous a responsibility  my colleagues and I had no personal ambition to assume power for its own sake. We saw it as our patriotic duty to take bold and forthright action to save our beloved country from the political  economic  social and moral decline that had overwhelmed it. As patriots  we felt we could not stand idly by and watch the total collapse of our nation. We had to act to put our country back on the road of socio-economic development and to restore its moral fibre. Ours was a very popular move  a case of unrepentant patriotism  as evidenced by the mass support we received then and continue to receive today. By our action  our fellow citizens have once more found strength and inspiration. Once more  the light in them has begun to glow and the fire to be rekindled. Notwithstanding such popular approval and the efforts we have exerted to rehabilitate and reconstruct the socio-economic fabric of our nation  let me declare from this rostrum that the government of the National Ruling Provisional Council has not come to stay in power. In the several decrees and proclamations issued since we assumed management of the affairs of the nation  we made our intentions and objectives quite clear. They remain the same: first  to bring to an end the rebel war imposed on our country and to rehabilitate the devastated war areas; secondly  to put our country's beleaguered economy on a sound and solid foundation; thirdly  to take all measures necessary for the recovery of all financial resources lawfully belonging to the Government; and finally  to relaunch the democratic process on a just  fair and lasting basis. With regard to the Liberian rebel invasion  my Government is employing all the resources at its disposal to ensure that our gallant soldiers  who are defending the nation at the war front  carry out their duties in the proper spirit and atmosphere. Not only are the proper logistics being provided for them  but their material welfare is being assured as well. But alas  against a weak economy such as ours and facing an aggressor that receives armed support from a country in our continent  which sees it as its mission to carry out revolutionary warfare and create instability in the various regions of our continent and beyond in the name of revolutionary ideals  my country should not be left alone to face such foreign onslaught. Hence my plea to this Organization for the necessary military  economic and diplomatic support to repel the invaders. The war has continued to attract attention at international gatherings. At the recent summit of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held at Dakar  for example  a far-reaching communique was adopted by the Heads of State which  among other things  gave Charles Taylor and his fellow rebels one month to fully comply with the Yamoussoukro Agreement  which includes  as an important element  the creation of a buffer zone between Liberia and Sierra Leone. Failing such compliance  all countries of the subregion would be required to impose sanctions against him and his armed bandits. We call upon the international community to lend full support to the efforts of ECOWAS and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to bring these senseless and reckless acts of banditry to a speedy conclusion. On the question of the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the war  my Government has adopted definitive measures that will be put into place as soon as peace returns to those areas. In this connection  a National Rehabilitation Committee has been set up to oversee this particular matter. It is for us a source of comfort that the international community stands ready to support us with a rehabilitation exercise as soon as the right atmosphere prevails.  In so far as the second objective  regarding the revitalization of our sick and battered economy  is concerned  my Government has continued to be guided by the understanding reached with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. My Government has demonstrated its determination to keep the International Monetary Fund programme on course. The new 1992-1993 budget  which was recently adopted  was framed with this particular aim in view. The signs are that we shall succeed. A dynamic programme for the collection of Government taxes and dues has been launched by the Department of Finance  and weekly as well as monthly revenue returns show that effective work is now going on to harness all financial resources due the Government. The Department of Trade and the Armed Forces have taken effective steps to ensure that our basic commodities are not taken out of the country illegally  a practice which was rampant in the past. Naturally the undertakings subscribed to by our Government have not been easy to implement in view of the weak nature of the economy and the suffering it imposes on our people. Nevertheless  the National Provisional Ruling Council Government is determined to see the programme through because of its awareness that only by succeeding in this difficult endeavour can we hope to achieve meaningful economic salvation and progress in the near future. On the objective relating to the relaunching of the democratic process in Sierra Leone  the National Provisional Ruling Council firmly believes that a democratic system of government can operate only within certain parameters which  if absent  will abort that process sooner or later. When the National Provisional Ruling Council assumed the reins of government it also inherited an unresponsive bureaucracy which had aided and abetted the political system that had ruined the socio-economic fabric of our society. The National Provisional Ruling Council Government therefore found it necessary as a first step to embark on a cleaning-up exercise to provide the basis for building a sustainable democratic system. For reasons of national security  some people have had to be taken into protective custody while they are  naturally  being investigated. All such persons are being well treated and investigated in accordance with internationally accepted standards. They have been allowed access to their lawyers. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International have been allowed to make regular visits. Recently  18 Liberian nationals who had been detained for alleged rebel activities were released. The various commissions of inquiry set up to investigate the detainees  among others  have remained impartial. Those found innocent will immediately be released while those with cases to answer will face an open and impartial trial. I wish to reiterate here that the National Provisional Ruling Council Government is committed to the rule of law and to the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the individual. As an indication of our commitment to the democratic process  the National Provisional Ruling Council has established an advisory council made up of eminent citizens from various walks of life and of proven integrity to advise the Government on the restoration of the democratic process. The principal task of that council will be to work out the modalities for returning the country to genuine multiparty democracy in the light of our national experience and within the shortest time possible. Since assuming office four months ago the National Provisional Ruling Council has brought about a completely new framework and spirit within which affairs of State and Government are conducted. In the first place  a new drive has been launched to generate total commitment  dedication and efficiency on the part of all Government and State functionaries. Sierra Leoneans generally are being made aware that they should see themselves as first-class citizens in their own country and that the potential of their country  in terms of economic and natural resources  can be harnessed to the full only by hard work  honesty and dedication on their part. We have attempted to liberate Sierra Leoneans from shame  restore their vision of what our country should be and enable every citizen to enjoy the fruits of his or her labour. In spite of our youth we believe we have demonstrated that capacity for leadership  that concern for our nation's welfare that previous Governments had failed to provide our country in the past 24 years. The youthfulness of the National Provisional Ruling Council Government should therefore not be held against us or made a reason for not extending economic assistance to our country. After a long period of darkness and neglect  the men  women and children of Sierra Leone deserve the support of the international community. We in Sierra Leone continue to view with dismay the unfavourable international economic environment. The continuing denial of access to a greater market share for our exports  the gradual decline in export earnings and the continuing inability to meet the target for official development assistance  not to mention the shortfall in real terms of such assistance  coupled with the high percentage of our gross domestic product diverted to debt-servicing. Each year it has been reported that the countries of sub-Saharan Africa struggle to pay about one third of the interest due on their debt of $150 billion; the rest is added to the rising mountain of debt under which the hope of the continent lies buried. The fact of the matter is that even the small portion of the interest which developing countries such as mine manage to pay is absorbing one quarter of all our export earnings and costing us each year more than our total expenditure on the health and education of our peoples. It is in the light of this that the conclusion has been drawn that all our efforts at socio-economic development will come to naught unless and until effective measures are taken to address the African debt problem  which is now an unbearable burden. While Sierra Leone continues to welcome the various initiatives that have been proposed  including those first put forward by Prime Minister Major of the United Kingdom and since developed into the Trinidad terms  and to pay tribute to those creditor countries that considered it necessary to cancel some of our debts  it is the widely held view  after careful study  that the present initiatives cannot be even remotely effective in achieving the objective of relieving debt burdens sufficiently for African countries to have a reasonable chance of successfully achieving structural adjustment  recovery or growth in the foreseeable future. It therefore remains our firm conviction that our plea for debt relief is both compelling and humane and hence must be answered. For many developing countries especially the least developed  like Sierra Leone - negative growth has become an all-too-familiar feature of economic performance  with three-digit inflation among its worst features. Simply put  this is not a situation that can be sustained indefinitely. Invariably  the greater the stresses many of our countries are called upon to bear  the less likely it becomes for the world economy to assume its own steady growth. While the interdependence of the global economy cannot be over-emphasized  the fact remains that in a global recession the pain is all the greater for countries such as mine. It is primarily for this reason that we hope that the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s  adopted by the Assembly last year  will attract a much greater degree of response and support than did its predecessor  the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986-1990. The innovative and more positive approach that the New Agenda offers should be seized by the international community to arrest and reverse the downward trend that the severity of the many economic and human crises has inflicted on African development. We cannot afford one more failure in this enterprise. Serious as our domestic preoccupations are  we shall be remiss if we fail to see events taking place elsewhere as important. It is in this vein that we must once again register our deep concern over the bloody violence that in recent months has been visited on the people of South Africa. The massacres in Boipatong and  even more recently  in Ciskei have today become a metaphor for the struggle against apartheid - just as Soweto was decades ago. How many more lives have to be lost  how many more families must taste the bitter fruit of violence  before the South African Government realizes that the campaign of terror being waged by its agents merely increases the scepticism over its real intentions? If the South African Government is to continue to receive the cautious approval of the international community for its agenda of political reform of its society  it must demonstrate good faith by arresting the descent into anarchy and bringing the perpetrators of the violence to justice. Denials can no longer be seen as allaying the fears of those who fervently wish to see change come by peaceful means. Sierra Leone therefore supported the decision of the Organization of African Unity Summit to bring the matter once again before the Security Council. We welcome the decision of the Council and commend the Secretary-General for dispatching observers to South Africa. This demonstrated the international community's continued concern over South Africa  and it is our hope that the mission will help to bring a halt to the violence and will facilitate resumption of the talks aimed at a peaceful solution of the problem. Southern Africa continues to be plagued by conflict  and the human cost is a grim reminder of how much more needs to be done to bring hope to the lives of the peoples of the subregion  especially those of Mozambique. Too many years of conflict have done little but ravage the country and leave the people with not much to hope for. Lately  with the proposed ceasefire agreement  there have been some hopeful signs. We commend the role played by various statesmen .in bringing this about  and we believe that the United Nations should bring its experience to bear in this final phase of the conflict. Now that a solution to the conflict is in sight  it is our hope that the world community will increase its humanitarian assistance to Mozambique  in view of the famine that threatens the population. With preparations under way in Angola for elections leading to a national government  it is our hope that peace will once again reign in that war-torn brotherly country. Somalia today has the makings of a great tragedy. With the raging of war  and the consequent massive outflow of refugees from that country  it is essential that the international community respond much more urgently and vigorously to this catastrophe. We cannot afford to sit by and watch the people of Somalia descend into a quagmire of death and destruction. From this tribune Sierra Leone calls on the Somali leaders to stop the war a war that has caused so much suffering to their people end the national suicide and embark on a process of negotiation and reconciliation. We should like to express our appreciation to the Secretary-General for bringing this tragedy to the attention of the international community. The plight of the southern Sudanese people  though perhaps less visible and less reported  is no less tragic than that of the people of Somalia. As a result of a long-running civil war  millions of Sudanese are today languishing and facing a slow and painful death through neglect and famine and because of military siege. Given the perils and immense suffering facing them  we call on this Organization to intensify its humanitarian-assistance efforts and its efforts to find a durable solution to the civil war now going on in that brotherly country. The peoples of Somalia and Sudan require all the support of this Organization  and  indeed  of the international community as a whole  in this their hour of national tragedy. The current Middle East negotiations have renewed our confidence that there will be peace in that volatile region. We allow ourselves to hope that in the peace talks now taking place all the parties - Israelis  Palestinians  through their chosen representatives  Syrians  Jordanians and Lebanese will work conscientiously and in good faith towards a resolution of decades of suspicion and conflict. What the world continues to witness in the former Yugoslavia defies human comprehension. The gravity and consequences of that war are reminiscent of conduct that the world had wished was only a memory. As the war continues to unfold  we may once again be facing  in an insidious form  the dread effects of racism in the former Yugoslavia  euphemistically described as ""ethnic cleansing"". This time should be different. We are concerned over the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The world cannot afford to be silent over what may become yet another sad chapter in its history. The ongoing efforts to bring that conflict to a speedy conclusion and save innocent lives must be intensified. We call upon all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia peoples we so much respected and admired to hearken to our plea  to bury the hatchet and try to live in peace once more. In other areas of the world  the guns of war have fallen silent and peace is being given a chance. In Cambodia and Angola there is renewed expectation and hope that peace will endure. To all these peoples  we in Sierra Leone extend our best wishes and urge them not to be distracted from the path of peaceful solution upon which they have embarked. When I started my address to the Assembly  I referred to this year as being a momentous one. Few years have been as auspicious as this one. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held at Rio de Janeiro this year provided us with a renewed opportunity to demonstrate our respect for the environment and ensure that our efforts at socio-economic development and the elimination of poverty should not be at the expense of the environment. Hence  Sierra Leone welcomes and supports the call for sustainable development of the environment. Also in the course of this momentous year we have observed a renewal of faith in the United Nations as mankind's best hope for peace  security and progress. Nowhere was this more visible than at the summit meeting of the Security Council held on 31 January. We saw life breathed into a dormant concept  a blueprint take shape  and the first steps of a long-delayed journey charted. For over four decades the Organization has wrestled with itself  torn between competing ideologies  becoming a helpless spectator to conflicts across the globe  paralysed with the cold-war neurosis. Our collective actions during this period seldom bore resemblance to the vision of the Charter  embracing  as they often did  more an inclination towards the veto than inspirations by altruistic considerations. Looking back  many will say we came through a crippling ritual sorely testing the Organization's capacity for promoting conflict resolution  social progress and better standards of living  while undermining our own faith in the efficacy of multilateralism. History may yet treat us kindly if we seize this sense of moment  seeing it as one more opportunity for all of us to give birth to the dream of the Charter. As the Secretary-General observes in his report  ""An Agenda for Peace"": ""The manifest desire of the membership to work together is a new source of strength in our common endeavour."" (A/47/277  para. 6) Indeed  the road ahead may be a demanding one  replete with pitfalls  challenging the emerging metamorphosis while enticing us to return to the mentality of the past. We must therefore be driven by a focused determination to broaden our horizon of cooperation  acting in a manner consistent with the Charter  thus ensuring that the peoples of the world inherit the common ends envisaged by the Charter. In closing  I should like  on behalf of my delegation and on my own account  to pay a tribute to our Secretary-General who  since his election  has left no stone unturned in exerting himself to find peaceful solutions to the many problems facing our world today. We recall our first encounter with the Secretary-General earlier this year in Dakar during the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) when we came to appreciate his wise counsel  which we took to heart. He has been reported to be a man who was born to be Secretary-General. By his leadership and other qualities he has justified the confidence which we in Africa first reposed in him and which the rest of the international community later endorsed. We wish him continued success in his mission. Finally  I should like once again to appeal through you  Mr. President  to the international community for their understanding. Our intervention of 29 April was prompted by the highest of motives the salvation of our nation. Like most of the representatives in the Assembly  we are committed to the democratic process and to the fundamental human rights of our fellow citizens. We also happen to believe in good governance  that political power must be exercised responsibly and in the interest of those for whom it is held in trust. This is our credo. We therefore appeal to the international community to give us a chance  to enable us to plot a new course for our nation and its people  to lay a solid foundation for a genuine democratic process and to put in place a realistic programme of economic recovery and survival. "
"142",6303,"SLV",47,1992,"I should like my first words in this great forum of the world Organization to be an expression of our great pleasure at the unanimous decision of the Assembly that you. Sir  should be the one to guide and direct its important work at the forty-seventh session. Your brilliant record  your undeniable personal prestige  your dedication to the ideals that inspire our Organization and the fact that you come from a part of the world where impressive positive changes are taking place are all signs that the United Nations  with determination and enthusiasm  is in step with the great phenomenon of our era: the reaffirmation of freedom as the driving force of history. We also recognize the splendid job done by your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi  who carried out his delicate task during a period of important national challenges which our Organization met with determination and with a sense of service. The presence of a new Secretary-General has given the period since the last session of the General Assembly a very special significance. This is an excellent opportunity to express again to the world our profound appreciation to the former Secretary-General  Javier Perez de Cuellar  not only because of the fine overall task he accomplished but more specifically because of his selflessness and his effective participation in achieving the final peace agreement in El Salvador  which he  his representatives and associates worked towards with such effort and conviction. We are also moved when we recall how that agreement was reached at the last minute of the Secretary-General's mandate  and therewith the peace of El Salvador was linked with the name of an illustrious Latin American of universal stature. When the new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  assumed his functions  we immediately realized that his unequivocal intention would be to continue to support  with his characteristic wisdom and experience  the difficult and exemplary process in which we Salvadorans are involved. This encourages us to remain faithful to past commitments and to believe that the new dynamics in El Salvador are irreversible  provided that we have the support of the international community. On a number of occasions  and specifically in our message of 16 January 1992 during the signing ceremony in Chapultepec  Mexico  we have said that peace in El Salvador is not just a matter of restoring normal conditions - those that prevailed before the conflict but of establishing peace of a new kind  unprecedented in our country. Besides being a civilized way of ending armed confrontation  peace is a complex series of commitments aimed at consolidating democracy in El Salvador. It is a means of providing more opportunities for pluralist participation  a way to create socio-political conditions for stability based on democratic legality among all existing sectors and groups of society.  This agreement  termed by the United Nations a unique agreement  is being implemented with the close cooperation of El Salvador and the international community. Conditions specific to that country  together with world events and in particular the end of the cold war  made it possible to conclude the conflict in El Salvador in a satisfactory manner. And at this point we should like to stress an issue that is of supreme importance: the subject of democracy. We have no doubt whatsoever that it has been the existence of the democratic process in our country that has made it possible for the war to gradually lose its historic vigour. It also made it possible to arrive at a kind of solution that appears to be permanent  one that will permit the building of peace  which is of course a long-term effort. The peace agreement is sound and convincing to the Salvadorian people and to the entire world as well  because it empowers and expands democracy. We would repeat here in this great forum  as we have done on the three earlier occasions on which we had the privilege of speaking the truth as we see it from this rostrum  that our main challenge and our most significant task is to serve the gradual democratization of El Salvador. In this manner we hope to contribute to security  internal progress and the stability of Central America. Our country has made major sacrifices and efforts to establish and safeguard the democratic process. Our Government - and we say this with legitimate satisfaction - has contributed boldly and relentlessly to the consolidation of democracy in El Salvador. We will not waver even for a moment  as we have recently demonstrated  in ensuring that this process moves forward in the future for the benefit of an entire population that has  as a result of great suffering  earned a stable peace  secure development and a better future. Our country's institutions have contributed greatly to all of these efforts  but we should like to emphasize that two in particular have given us their determined support: our political institution  the Nationalist Republican Alliance  and the armed forces of El Salvador. They have given us  and continue to do so  fundamental support in ensuring that democracy in El Salvador becomes a reality and peace a concrete fact. We shall not tire of saying that the people of El Salvador are the major protagonists in this new and historic stage. All of us are involved in building an integrated society  one that can jointly settle its differences and realize its aspirations. In order to achieve this  peace must be the first priority. Without a stable peace  freedoms could become fragile and progress uncertain. We consider it essential that this process be carried out in accordance with the terms of the peace agreement. Significant progress has been made in implementing the corresponding commitments  starting on 16 January. Many difficulties have arisen technical  logistical  financial and political but  with the efficient support of the United Nations  we are now in a position to conclude the crucial stage of the cessation of armed confrontation on 31 October as scheduled. On this solemn occasion we appeal to the international community represented here  hoping that they will support our decision and our determination to scrupulously respect this deadline. At that point  the military structure of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) will come to an end  because the Government has been fulfilling its various political and constitutional commitments and will continue to do so in a serious and responsible manner. We should like to move to another important stage of the process  in which political freedom will determine the rate of progress in our country  in all walks of life. Our peace process  because of it¬´ characteristics and its potential  stands as an example for others to follow. We are extremely pleased that in El Salvador unprecedented events of great importance are taking place. The role and performance of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) is one of those phenomena  and it is in keeping with the new role that falls to the United Nations in the post-cold-war period. In this connection  we fully support the concepts contained in the report of the Secretary-General prepared in keeping with the statement agreed upon on 31 January of this year at the summit meeting of the Security Council. That document  entitled ""An Agenda for Peace""  reflects the experience accumulated by the Organization in the area of preventive diplomacy and the establishment  maintenance and consolidation of peace. That experience is now guiding the Organization. The case of El Salvador is one of the clearest and most persuasive examples of the fact that our Organization is fulfilling the responsibilities required of it by the events and dynamics of the times  and it is doing so efficiently and opportunely within this new  increasingly interlinked world where there is a growing sense of globalism. In this connection  we emphasize that there is a strong trend not only towards economic globalism but also towards democratization and the safeguarding of peace throughout the world. Today no one is immune to the conflicts that used to be called peripheral. The distortions that existed until not so long ago  due to the permanent tension reigning in an ideologically bipolar world  have given way to a much more realistic  humanitarian approach to the world's problems: understanding the world as an integrated zone of peace where even the most local conflict is now a concern of the international community  which is speedily developing the ways and means of creating effective cooperation in peacemaking efforts  without resorting to the barbarism of intervention or the arrogance of unilateral operations. The concept of the international policeman is  fortunately  being replaced by something much more modern and constructive: joint agreement to face acute crises that jeopardize international peace and stability. This brings us back to the concept of democracy  which is the key topic of our time. In this regard  we fully associate ourselves with the remarks of the Secretary-General in his aforementioned report: ""Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its principles within the world Organization itself. This requires the fullest consultation  participation and engagement of all States  large and small  in the work of the Organization. All organs of the United Nations must be accorded  and play  their full and proper role so that the trust of all nations and peoples will be retained and deserved. The principles of the Charter must be applied consistently  not selectively  for if the perception should be of the latter  trust will wane and with it the moral authority which is the greatest and most unique quality of that instrument. Democracy at all levels is essential to attain peace for a new era of prosperity and justice."" (A/47/277  para. 82) We Salvadorians  immersed as we are in a process of radical  conscious transformation of our society  make an unequivocal declaration of trust in the United Nations by placing in its hands the vital task of verifying all peace agreements. It is no exaggeration to say that few countries have placed such confidence in the Organization. This shows our great desire for peace and democracy  and at the same time it makes both us and the Organization responsible. In other words  in the process in El Salvador we are all gaining valuable experience  and we have no doubt that our original approach to overcoming conflict and seeing to it that the solution serves as a political and social platform for the future makes this one of the most important landmarks in the process of transition that is taking place in the international community today. Salvadorians cannot afford to vacillate  nor can we be found wanting in this great effort to heal our country of the deep-rooted bad habits of the past and of the ravages of war. This commitment to our own history is also in keeping with the spirit of our times  to which we feel so closely linked. The fact that we are so involved in building a new national reality that goes much deeper than an ideological revolution for it pragmatically recognizes change and dynamism as the driving force behind social and political life - does not inhibit us but  on the contrary  connects us to a world that is in a surprising process of renewal. We are only now emerging from a paralysing period of confrontation  so we do not yet know what policies and doctrines will prevail in the future. But we do know that concepts such as political freedom  social pluralism  market economics and international cooperation are all in the forefront of people's thinking and action throughout most of the world. After so many years of rhetorical preaching  today there are for the first time sound indications that a genuine international community is being forged - and this fills us with optimism and a sense of security. That optimism and security do not prevent us from expressing our concerns regarding the problems remaining with us  perhaps even more dramatically than before  such as the deterioration of economic and social conditions which continue to exist in the developing countries and the catastrophic situation as regards the environment  which is threatening the very survival of mankind on Earth. The existence of such problems is not limited to just a few countries or just one region rather than others. As in the case of peace and democracy  these are global issues  and for that reason this forum must deal with them as matters of priority. It is no longer the nuclear nightmare that frightens us  but rather the dying of nature  which we have mercilessly abused  even to the point of endangering our own species. No longer is it the power of the super-Powers that is such a threat to mankind's survival; it is the ancient scourge of poverty that continues to erode the foundations of our civilization  whose great and unshirkable task is now to protect the dignity of all human beings without distinction as to race  culture or geographic location. The United Nations today  thanks to the emerging new world order  has a responsibility to integrate the world  something that was unimaginable only a short time ago. We believe that at this session  which is the first one truly taking place in a post-cold-war atmosphere  the Assembly must make renewed  imaginative efforts to overcome existing stereotypes in a world that became accustomed to functioning as a kind of battlefield. If we could graphically describe the international reality that should prevail in our day  we would imagine all the nations of the world sitting around a table discussing  on an equal footing  the problems that inevitably affect us all. The era of trench warfare and walls is now behind us  much to the dismay of the skeptics and to the delight of those who never really ceased to believe in the possibility of a better world with freedom and democracy. Incredible though it may seem  we are entering an era in which peace is no longer just a fine word with no real meaning. El Salvador is a small country  but it is a small  great country that does not want to deprive itself of the great opportunity provided by peace. That applies to ourselves  to our neighbours  to our natural cultural community and to the world. Thus  we give priority to respect for human rights; we are trying to organize our economy; we have definitively renounced war as a means of dealing with internal or international problems. For that reason  we are here  calling on the economically most powerful nations to renew with actions their generous commitment to collaborate in the costly process of peace in El Salvador so that it will not be thwarted by lack of financial resources. The flow of external assistance to carry out the concrete agenda of bringing about peace is at a critical stage. That is why  from this rostrum  we renew our appeal for international solidarity to contribute to consolidating peace without obstacles in El Salvador. While the process is moving ahead in our country  and we are committed to its doing so fully and consistently  regional developments are no less promising. As a result of a decision of the International Court of Justice  we have just settled an old dispute with the fraternal Republic of Honduras  and we renew our unequivocal commitment to abide in good faith by that decision. At the same time  we continue striving to promote regional integration  especially with our Central American brothers. We believe in the common destiny of Central America  and for that reason we are working in a coordinated way to see to it that our region will be a zone of lasting democracy  progress and stability. We believe more and more in the real possibility of achieving a united Central America in which every country  without losing its identity  develops its own potential. It is a great task of the present with tremendous implications for the future. We feel that we are members of the Iberian-American community of nations  which  though it does not yet exist officially  is becoming a reality in spirit and in the common aim of giving it shape. We have felt the beneficial effects of solidarity among nations that share the same language and culture. We have received and continue to receive enormous support from countries such as Mexico  Spain  Venezuela and Colombia  the ""Group of Four Friends""  whose contribution to achieving and consolidating peace is a shining page in our history. We reiterate our appreciation to them and to other friendly countries that have helped us in the great task of making El Salvador a new country. We express once again our conviction that the United Nations  now more than ever  has a mission for the future. On its agenda two matters are at the forefront: global peace and sustainable international development. We are convinced that the United Nations  faced with those issues  will prove to be what President Bush said two days ago in this forum it would be: an Organization of truly united nations  for the first time since it was founded. We are especially pleased to welcome the new States that have joined this great family of the United Nations. Their presence  which enhances the status of the Organization  is due largely to the great freedom movement that has marked our time. We favour the principle of universality  meaning that all the countries of the world  without exception  must be present in our Organization and must contribute. Thus we offer our support to help ensure that all pending cases and those that might emerge in the future will be resolved positively. El Salvador has devoted all its energies to the peace process  towards whose success the United Nations is making such a decisive  efficient contribution. We will not waver for a moment in promoting that process  which is a matter of rebuilding the country and setting an example to the rest of the world. Those of us who have been on the side of freedom and democracy all along have been proved right by time. But that triumph is not ours; it belongs to the peoples of the world who have already suffered too much not to see  and soon  the fruits of progress  which are the only guarantees of internal stability and peace among nations.

"143",6328,"SMR",47,1992,"The recent accession of the Republic of San Marino to membership of the United Nations makes it possible for me to take part in this general debate  prompted by the desire to contribute to fulfilment of the great tasks of the Organization. San Marino has always paid attention to the difficult work undertaken by the United Nations. We have felt deep satisfaction with its several achievements and have shared the anxiety and disappointment caused by the numerous violations of peace and by the obstacles to progress that this Organization has had to face. What impressed us most was seeing the idea of universality  originally embodied in the Charter  become a reality in which everyone might participate. The United Nations has undertaken the difficult and essential task of drawing the world's attention to the issues and problems that mankind must face urgently. Thanks to the commitment of the United Nations  our hopes have been strengthened by greater certainty by a deeper sense of confidence. Today the world and  in particular  the European continent are concentrating their attention on the former Yugoslavia on its never-ending war  on the useless destruction of goods and property  on the inexcusable death of too many civilians  on the indiscriminate use of heavy weapons  on the extremely serious violations of fundamental human rights  on the unacceptable concentration camps a phenomenon that we believed Europe had relegated to history on the obstacles brutally placed in the way of the relief missions that have been so generously organized by the United Nations  and on the non-observance of the rights of minorities and of freedom of religion. If I am to speak frankly  as my position requires  I have to say that crimes that we have always considered to be the most serious  nationally and internationally  are being committed  and have been a reality for quite a long time  in the former Yugoslavia. A premeditated and determined refusal to find a peaceful solution must be considered an act of war  but counter-attack is difficult when there has been no actual attack. Peace is not a condition that can be imposed; it is a more complex reality  a permanent state that has to be felt. In my opinion  every man has to be resolved to want peace and want to live in peace. This condition may exist only if men are in a state of peace  if their rights are respected  and if they are free to enjoy their liberty and their rights. It may exist only if men's legitimate aspirations are satisfied and if everyone is convinced that  in the exercise of his rights  nobody is riding roughshod over the rights of any other person  even if that person is of a different colour or a different faith. The most praiseworthy and indispensable initiatives aimed at the restoration of peace will be useless until men are educated to a deep-rooted sense of peace. I believe that this is the future role of the United Nations a role that the Organization will have to play with determination and authority. We have a common duty to contribute to the removal of war-clouds and bilateral tensions. It is essential that we commit ourselves to that end. In those circumstances  humanitarian support is increasingly  necessary. The entire world should be grateful to the United Nations for carrying out its mission with courage and great generosity in risky circumstances  which  owing to the irresponsibility of those who encourage and support war  can sometimes turn to tragedy. But let me invite representatives to take on a more effective commitment to the idea and the sentiment of peace. We must all defend the right to peace  the main feature of which is freedom and respect for minorities. What force must freedom have if peace is to be maintained? It is the force rooted in and safeguarded by democratic government. I am well aware that even the most advanced democracies are far from satisfying the two requisites of freedom. The first requisite  which takes a negative form  is the absence of any need to depend on the will of others; the second  which takes a positive form  is participation in the decision-making processes. In any case  I am convinced that any other political system would do more to deprive people of freedom. Democracy  even in its most imperfect forms  is organized in such a way as to ensure that individuals may participate in the exercise of power. This occurs where there is positive freedom. However  that freedom is limited if negative freedoms freedom of thought  freedom of association and of religion  and all the other freedoms granted by modern constitutions - are not guaranteed and safeguarded. This implies that everyone must account for all acts perpetrated against freedom all acts that violate human rights  and all acts that imperil peace. San Marino believes that the concept of personal responsibility must be stressed and must be made paramount internationally. In democratic institutions  the exercise of power both political and military is a service rendered to civil and democratic growth and the social economic development of the entire community  in favour of the individual  never against him. Those who use power against a part of the community  against a minority or against a group of individuals  or those who hinder or make civil  cultural  social and economic development regress must account for their actions. In these days the tragic scenes and information from Somalia fill us with sorrow. It is an offense to our civilization  intelligence and dignity that on the threshold of the year 2000 people should be starving to death. Unfortunately  we still have to cope with this tragic reality  and we hope that the United Nations will find timely and real solutions to this problem. On the other hand  many other situations are awaiting solutions that are neither easy and immediate: the fight against drugs; the improper use of the natural environment and the damage caused by air and nuclear pollution; the phenomenon of migrations and the obligations States have towards immigrants; refugees' living conditions and the causes of the refugee phenomenon; issues concerning the young and the incentive to a greater commitment by the young to modern society; the struggle against racism and racial discrimination  against all forms of intolerance and against any attempt to restore that horrible practice called ethnic cleansing; terrorism; the ever-lasting imbalance in the distribution of wealth and resources which impoverishes poor countries more and more. Having mentioned the tragedy which has overwhelmed Somalia  I should like  on behalf of my country  wish to renew to the people of Somalia the expression of our most sincere solidarity.  Environmental conditions  drought  famine  relentless desertification  the simple tools used in impoverished agriculture and the unfair distribution of food supplies caused by the lack of solidarity determine the daily life of millions of people suffering from hunger. However  one of the biggest scandals of our time is the fact that the food supplies made available do not reach those who have been waiting for them for so long that they no longer need them. Representatives probably thought that the speech delivered by the representative of the Republic of San Marino to the General Assembly would be a systematic and comprehensive review of the United Nations activities. Rather  I wished to make a number of remarks on how the world could change in order to become a better one. The Charter of the United Nations and the unanimous and determined commitment of the Security Council  the General Assembly and the various United Nations agencies  commissions and committees show that today only the United Nations is capable of improving this world be making it more equitable. In the long history of the small Republic of San Marino  an important statement is recorded: at the end of the thirteenth century  a judge  who had been given the task of finding a solution to a real estate dispute between the people of San Marino and some podestas in nearby Montefeltro  questioned a citizen from the San Marino community in order to know why that community was free from certain duties. The reason given by that citizen was that San Marino was free and made up of free men. The judge  out of curiosity  asked the witness: ""quid est libertas?"" The man quickly and firmly replied: ""Nemini teneri"" - not to be subject to anybody. A modern interpretation of those words is that a free man is one whose personality and dignity are respected. San Marino hopes to see this concept become a reality throughout the world. We are sure that this goal can be achieved  with the free and determined contribution of all under the auspices of the United Nations. "
"144",6410,"STP",47,1992,"On behalf of the Sao Tome and Principe delegation  I should like to congratulate the President on his unanimous election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. His election is unquestionably a tribute to his country and a recognition of his qualities as a diplomat. May I take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the efficient manner in which his predecessor  Ambassador Samir Shihabi  presided over the work of the forty-sixth session. We should like to again express our confidence in and admiration for the leadership shown by the Secretary-General Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in dealing with the challenges facing the Organization in this crucial phase of its history. We extend our greetings to the new Members of the Organization. Their admission is a confirmation of the universalist calling of the United Nations at time when its actions are making themselves felt everywhere in the world. The end of the cold war has made it possible to foresee a new era in international relations  characterized by respect for international law and for the principles inscribed in Charter of the United Nations  and by a search for solutions to the great and complex problems that are on the agenda of the human community. Our hopes for a better world  held hostage for so long by the reductive Manichaeism of the East-West conflict  have taken form and are reflected in a common desire to create a new world order based on respect for the legitimate rights of peoples  on lasting peace  on a more balanced distribution of world resources  and on active solidarity between the rich and poor peoples of our planet  with the United Nations as a focal point and point of reference. While it is absolutely clear today that important steps are being taken towards making some of these aspirations a reality  it is no less certain that the definition of priorities  the selection of means  the allocation of the necessary resources and  in some cases  the very solutions chosen all reflect conditionalities born of the old order and bespeak a selective approach that does not always match the noble purposes and principles that inspire the United Nations Charter. While it is not realistic to expect an immediate solution to such complex and difficult problems as those that result from the profound imbalance we find between North and South  the absence of any concrete and serious movement in this direction continues to be a concern. That millions of men  women and children are living in circumstances that are a denial of their human condition is not admissible in this century  which has been witness to so many of man's conquests. That entire peoples should also find their fundamental rights denied by the forces of occupying regimes  in flagrant violation of Security Council decisions  is clearly anachronistic  especially when the United Nations has  in some cases  already mobilized the collective will of its Members and the mechanisms provided for in its Charter to impose respect for international law. That liberation from the oppressor's yoke  which keeps entire nations subjugated  is giving rise to acts of truly suicidal barbarism in various parts of the world is a challenge to which we must respond with the greatest urgency and determination. That the future of the coming generations on this planet is being menaced by the irresponsible and blind exploitation of limited resources in the name of short-term interests reveals an individualism that cannot leave us indifferent. For this reason  we would like to associate the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe with those who  from this very rostrum  have condemned the violence that threatens the initiatives aimed at seeking a peaceful and negotiated solution in South Africa  within the context of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa  the path chosen for a peaceful transition to power for the black majority. For this reason too we salute the Angolan people for the maturity it has demonstrated throughout the recent electoral process  which will permit the Republic of Angola to dedicate itself  in an atmosphere of peace and national reconciliation  to the tremendous task of rebuilding the country. We cannot but regret that last-minute problems have prevented the scheduled signature of the cease-fire agreements between the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO. We would like to express our solidarity with the Peoples of Mozambique and our encouragement to the parties involved to persevere on the path of a peaceful solution with all the seriousness and commitment that the situation demands. We are following the Middle East negotiations with great anticipation  hoping that they will lead to the realization of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and a solution to the territorial conflicts that separate the peoples of the region  in compliance with the pertinent resolutions of the Security Council. We hope  likewise  that the self-determination referendum in Western Sahara will permit the people of that territory to decide their own destiny. It is for this reason  too  that we lament the fact that the people of East Timor have had their voice silenced and that the massacres of which they are the victims are not sufficient evidence that their legitimate right to self-determination has been repressed by the force of an occupation that is on all counts contrary to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We would like to believe that the recent meeting between the Foreign Ministers of Portugal  the administering Power  and Indonesia  under the auspices of the Secretary General  will lead to a serious process of negotiation aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the question that will end the suffering of the people of East Timor. In our view  it is essential that at the appropriate time representatives of the people of East Timor be involved in the negotiating process. At the same time  we cannot fail to repudiate and vigorously condemn those responsible for the gratuitous suffering and human misery imposed on the peoples of Somalia  Liberia  and Bosnia and Herzegovina. We believe that any reluctance to implement the decisions of the Rio de Janeiro Summit will  over time  compromise our common destiny. Today more than ever before  the United Nations as an organization has a role of fundamental importance to play in defining the new world order that is being built  assuming responsibility  in the spirit of the Charter and with the participation of all its Members  for translating our collective aspirations into joint undertakings that will mobilize our energies and resources and optimize the potential contributions of each individual Member State. Thus  our admiration and encouragement go out to our Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the efforts he is making to restructure the Secretariat and for the initiatives he is pressing in various areas of the Organization's activities. We believe it is essential that the decision-making process within our Organization be in keeping with the democratic principles so dear to us  and that the organs and mechanisms for the promotion of economic and social development be upgraded in order to permit a more effective response to the major challenges that humanity faces as this century nears its end. The dynamism  breadth and consensus that inspire the activities of the Organization in the areas of conflict prevention and peace-keeping must lead us to pay special attention to the effort to restructure the economic and social sector in order to maximize the effectiveness of the intervention of the various agencies of the system an effort already under way  as we have been informed in the Secretary-General's report. The establishment of a new  more just and more lasting world order would appear to presuppose and assume at the national level a two-fold  fundamental challenge of our times: democratization and development. Over and above selecting the model most suited to the historical and socio-cultural realities of each country  it is quite clear today that the establishment of institutions that favour the participation of the people in the management of public affairs and respect for basic human rights  including the free and regular choice of leaders  is today a condition for any lasting development. It is also evident that  in view of the high level of dependence of the so-called third-world countries on the outside world  no development will be possible unless we see a change in the unequal terms of exchange that condemn the gigantic effort of many peoples to the caprices of a free market in which decisions are taken totally without their consent. Powerless victims of the imponderables of the world economy  in which they play but a marginal role  the nations of the third world will never be in a position to meet the development challenge unless fairer and more appropriate mechanisms are introduced in international economic relations to alter the terms of the involvement of those nations in the process of world exchanges. For a growing group of these countries the least developed countries international solidarity must be mobilized through cooperation more attuned to their requirements and better suited to the specific needs of each one. We in Sao Tome and Principe are prepared and determined to meet this twofold challenge. Faced with the need to move beyond the state of lethargy in which our-country found itself  political forces in Sao Tome turned to the path of transformation that led to the establishment of a democratic State through a process in which the dominant notes are dialogue  tolerance  the achievement of consensus and respect for diversity of viewpoints. The political aspect of this endeavour found fertile ground  for the reasons I mentioned earlier and because it corresponded to the aspiration of the people to a future in which their fundamental rights and guarantees will be duly safeguarded. I must note  however  that major constraints of an economic and financial nature  the precipitous drop in the standard of living  and an inability to see light at the end of the tunnel of our deep concerns will surely pose a threat to the new democratic regime  with the whole array of consequences this could have. The dilemma posed by a crisis that is unbearable on all counts and by the implementation of democratic principles demonstrates clearly that the insistent calls for the democratization of developing countries will never go beyond a mere Utopian dream unless they are backed by a new international vision open to a realistic solution of the debt problem  to a favourable change in the terms of trade and to a gradual transfer of technology to the raw-material-producing countries  thus giving them the ability to transform themselves to their own profit. There are few moments in the common history of mankind when  as in our own time  the political  economic  defence and security architecture of the planet undergoes profound and significant changes. The diversity  the complexity and  not unexpectedly  the unpredictability of these changes represent an opportunity that must not be lost to make decisions towards correcting the asymmetries and injustices forged by an order which is gradually disintegrating before our eyes. For we are all aware of the non-viability of a world whose contrasts shock and whose profound inequalities constitute unequivocal factors of instability and revolt. We therefore believe that only an international effort of intelligent convergence will permit responses that can satisfy the legitimate interests of peoples all over the world: a task in which the United Nations should play a key role  a role it is already demonstrating it can assume through intervention that is increasingly prestigious because it is incisive and pragmatic  covering the most varied regions of the world. Despite the re-emergence of political  religious and ethnic intolerance that all too often degenerates into more extended areas of instability  and despite the persistence of major symptoms of inequality in cooperation among nations and the consequent inequality in the living conditions of the peoples concerned it is fair to state that we have taken a giant step forward. The more skeptical among us will say that one step is not much on the long road ahead of us  but we retain the hope that  together  freed of exacerbated and futile self-centredness  we will be capable of progressing along the arduous path to which we are irrevocably committed. The immediate tomorrows may not hear a lot of song  but the future belongs to the world. "
"145",6444,"SUR",47,1992,"The delegation of the Republic of Suriname congratulates you most warmly. Sir  upon your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly. You bring to that high post a wealth of experience and dedication  qualities that augur well for a successful accomplishment of the task before us. Allow us to thank your predecessor. His Excellency Mr. Samir Shihabi  for the excellent manner in which he guided the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We wish him well in his future endeavours. We should like to welcome and congratulate the Secretary-General of the United Nations on his assumption of that lofty and equally responsible office. He has assumed the leadership of the Organization at a very difficult and crucial time marked by many political changes  a time at which greater involvement of the Organization in international affairs is demanded. We wish the Secretary-General well and assure him of our fullest cooperation. I take this opportunity to welcome into the United Nations the newly independent States of Armenia  Azerbaijan  Kyrgyzstan  Kazakhstan  Moldova  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Uzbekistan  and Georgia. I should also like to welcome San Marino  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  and Slovenia. As reported to the General Assembly on previous occasions  for many years Suriname experienced a domestic armed struggle that brought sorrow and mourning to our people and restricted our possibilities for development. We now wish to inform the Assembly that  through patient negotiations  our efforts have resulted in a recently signed agreement for national reconciliation and development. From the very beginning  my Government has attached the highest priority to achieving reconciliation in the country  for my Government wishes to realize the full potential of the Surinamese people in harmony with their aspirations for lasting democratic stability. Negotiations were started as part of our conviction that peace should gradually be forged  based on a political understanding of the various forces involved. Moreover  peace can only be reached if negotiations are promoted and conducted in order to yield lasting results for the benefit of our people. We called in the assistance of the Organization of American States  which  under the auspices of its Secretary-General  Mr. Joao Clemente Baena Soares  provided support in the process of concluding the agreement and in demobilization. Together with his worthy representative  we have succeeded. Concrete results have been achieved  followed by the signing of a substantial agreement based on the crucial need for reconstruction and development and which guarantees respect for human rights. Today  we rejoice that reconciliation in Suriname is concrete and feasible. It has strengthened our determination to achieve national harmony and national development. We are confident that the Organization of American States will render its valuable support in verifying compliance with the agreement  so as to ensure that the established peace-agreement will be observed.  As this body has been informed  in 1991 democracy was restored in my country  true to the will of the people. Yet  we must not lose sight of the fact that newly restored democracies such as ours are fragile  and depend to a considerable extent on international understanding and support. My Government has since then made progress in establishing a degree of much-needed political stability  and can now concentrate on finding solutions to the current grave economic crisis  and the potential social crisis  confronting my country. Our socio-economic problems  which have resulted in a sharp decline in production  increased unemployment  sharp price increases and a deteriorating standard of living for the majority of the population  have now compelled us to take serious corrective measures to halt the economic decline and boost economic growth. Experiences throughout the world show that no government can successfully carry out a programme for economic reconstruction and development without the fullest national and international support. My Government has decided to implement a programme for adjustment  recovery and growth. In this context  we have secured valuable support from the European Community. Furthermore  we can report to this Assembly that development cooperation with the Netherlands has been re-established  and that the signing of the framework treaty for friendship and closer cooperation has added a new dimension to bilateral relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Suriname. Thus  we are encouraged because our national development strategy has found a ready response from the international community in this crucial aspect of our democratic process.  I can assure this Assembly  and with some emphasis  that in implementing the adjustment programme our view is that a well-balanced and consistent approach to the social dimensions of the programme is indispensable to its final outcome. In the past few years  forces of change have transformed the international political arena and profoundly changed the major balance of power that emerged from the Second World War. Antagonisms and hostility between the super-Powers have been replaced by unprecedented joint efforts and partnership. This has facilitated  through dialogue and by peaceful means  the solution of a number of regional conflicts and the settlement of others. We believe that the new political climate has had constructive effects in the world  and has enabled us to define a broader and more fully integrated role in international security. The international community is experiencing a rebirth of the United Nations after 45 years of existence  for the fullest use is being made of its peacemaking and peace-keeping potential in order to bring about just and lasting peace in several parts of the world. As a result of the new mandate of this reinvigorated Organization  our hopes are being justified that it will not be long before the unfolding dramas of human suffering  exploitation  poverty  fratricide  hunger and malnutrition  and aggressive nationalism will finally be banished from the planet. Our Organization is facing the challenge and responsibility of bringing about an overall and lasting settlement of various problems on the basis of respect for the rights of all. It must encourage States to adhere to the Charter  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant instruments as the best means of protecting and promoting human rights. We support a just and lasting settlement in Central and Eastern Europe: we are concerned about the growing tensions and conflicts in that region  which endanger international peace and security. We are keeping close track of developments in former Yugoslavia  and take this opportunity to welcome the efforts of our Organization  the London Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement summit. A just and lasting settlement is necessary on the African continent  we are deeply concerned by the threat from the growing instability in the Horn of Africa caused by the conflict in Somalia. We express regret that  despite the signing of a cease-fire agreement  the parties involved have not abided by their commitments and have thus not permitted the unimpeded distribution of humanitarian assistance to those in need. In this respect  my delegation has endorsed the proposal to convene a conference on the national reconciliation  reconstruction and unity of Somalia which should lead to a peaceful and lasting political settlement of the conflict. My delegation strongly condemns the tragic escalation of violence in South Africa  which has halted the negotiating process within the framework of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). We strongly urge the South African regime to create a climate that is conducive to peaceful negotiations aimed at an agreement on the text of a new constitution based on a non-racial  democratic and united South Africa. An overall and lasting settlement is needed for the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine issue. My Government firmly supports the ongoing peace process  which is aimed at reaching a just  comprehensive and durable solution to the question of the Middle East. We welcome the progress made in reaching overall settlements of the conflicts in Asia  particularly in Cambodia and Afghanistan. The establishment of the transitional Government in Afghanistan is a positive development towards peace  national reconciliation and reconstruction in that country. We support the efforts of the Secretary-General to reach an agreement on a set of fundamental principles with a view to reaching an overall agreement on the question of Cyprus. With regard to Latin America and the Caribbean  we are pleased to note that the processes of democratization  harmonization  reconciliation and economic integration are gradually bearing fruit. The agreements between the Government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front mark the closing of a decade of fratricidal war. They will undoubtedly contribute to lasting peace and stability  which are imperative for the region's development. We express full support for the struggle of the people of Haiti to restore democracy and respect for human rights in their country  and for the efforts of the Organization of American States towards this end. As we advance in the decade of the '90s  the economic and social problems of developing countries continue to be manifold. Difficult decisions will therefore be needed to address the issue of international economic adjustment and development in order to eliminate the imbalances between the North and the South. The worsening of the economic situation and social conditions in many developing countries has led to a decline in the standard of living and to the persistence and increase of widespread poverty. The elimination of hunger and malnutrition  the improvement of health standards and the eradication of illiteracy should be issues of paramount concern in the coming decades. My delegation therefore holds the view that these aims can best be achieved by putting into motion a people-centered development process. It is in this context that my delegation warmly supports the convening of a Summit for Social Development in order to enable the international community to deal extensively with the complex but most important question of human development. Though no substantive commitment to new funds was made during the recently held Rio Conference on Environment and Development  it should be noted as an important achievement of the international community that a programme of action. Agenda 21  and the Rio Declaration have been adopted. The Rio Conference has clearly established the close link between environment  growth and development  the primary issues for the international community. It is as a consequence of the results of the Rio summit that during the current General Assembly special attention must be paid to institutional follow-up of the Rio Conference. In this regard  we attach great importance to the establishment of the Commission on Sustainable Development. This  Commission must of necessity become the primary and most important forum for consultation and must set the trend for measures to implement Agenda 21 at national  regional and global levels. Once again I should like to emphasize that in the new international environment the role and function of the United Nations has become universally accepted. We have witnessed an increased interest in multilateralism and a renewal of the relevance of the United Nations and its main bodies. The peacemaking and peace-keeping activities of this world Organization in many regions have  more than at any time in the past  opened prospects for its greatly enhanced role in the maintenance of world peace and security. These activities have proved to be effective procedures  well-suited to present-day realities. The opportunities offered by the Charter in the fields of preventive diplomacy  fact-finding and good-offices missions should be optimally explored  so as to provide the Secretary-General with a suitable structure for the prevention and timely management of crises and conflicts.

The process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  which on the international scene in Europe complements the United Nations system on a regional level and whose documents helped the wave of democratic changes in Europe was  to a large extent  created with the objective of accelerating cooperation and integration. The CSCE was constructed and developed on the basic principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and which constitute a vital precondition for the security  peace  welfare and progress of all. All CSCE participating States were therefore expected to agree voluntarily to those principles in their own interest. However  the CSCE was left without suitable means to respond to situations in which a State violated and did not respect those principles and norms. The war in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all the horrors which  thanks to the media  are known to the whole world  as well as the Balkan crisis  in which we were also involved  are an important experience for the CSCE  for the United Nations and for the world at large. It teaches us that it is relatively simple to plead for peace. It is much more difficult to guarantee security and to create the stable conditions that would allow urgent and peaceful changes in accordance with the principles upholding peace  security and prosperity. This is the most important function of the United Nations and of all regional organizations and is the basis of our support for the proposal that the United Nations should rapidly create mechanisms for adjusting to emerging changes in the world. In his report ""An Agenda for Peace""  the Secretary-General has made an exceptionally cogent contribution to efforts to ensure the gradual establishment of security machinery that will enable the peaceful settlement of all disputes  primarily through an insight into the circumstances and the  timely mobilization of international institutions  to prevent or quickly cut short armed conflicts between States Members of the United Nations and between sovereign States. It is in the interest of the international community that a war  if it occurs  does not spread to new regions and countries. The report contains many useful ideas about the building of peace after the conflict has been brought to an end and about when it becomes possible and necessary to create conditions for long-term security and stability in relations between the participants in the conflict. The United Nations may establish machinery which will enable it to intervene speedily to help the democratization of international and internal relations and implementation of self-determination and thus prevent lapsing into the kind of violence that is now tragically escalating in the Balkans. The United Nations has in the past been a forum for achieving the self-determination of many peoples. As such it was supported by Slovenia which  through its active role in the Allied anti-fascist coalition as part of former Yugoslavia  was among the Founding Members of the Organization. It is therefore understandable that we expect the United Nations to continue in this role the future. The world Organization has ever more Members. This is not the result or expression of some incomprehensible process of fragmentation: it is an expression of democratization of relations within those non-traditional States which were built not on the principle of national equality and the real common interest of their nations but on ideologies  on fear of bloc threats. In these multi-national States the levers of integration were not economic success and respect for the welfare and dignity of man  but rather  monopolistic ideologies and a unitary party and army. In these States the interests and dignity of people and nations were mainly subordinated to the interests of the State and party or its apparatus. States such as Yugoslavia which  from a historical point of view  were artificial creations should have constantly re-examined and demonstrated their raison d'√™tre in the light of changing historical circumstances. Their disintegration is not a priori in contradiction with the logic and needs of integration. It is part of the same process. Individual nations enter the process of integration at different points. With the formation of their own States  they create the conditions necessary in order to enter the process of their own free will. We cannot exclude the possibility that new links and cooperation among States will emerge. It is essential that such links must first conform to the principles of international law  democracy  and respect for universally recognized standards for the protection of human rights and the rights of minorities and nations. The trend of the pre-modern world was towards the concentration of power through the conquest of territory and war. The trend of the modern world is increasingly economic through cooperation and association  through improvement of the quality of life and respect for natural limitations trends which were at least partly defined at the recent world ecological summit. Slovenia is situated in an area where the pre-modern and modern worlds meet in both perception and in practice. It is in the interest of the United Nations and of all nations of the modern world  so that the modern world will border only on the modern world.  Allow me to suggest that after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the democratization of Eastern Europe  the democratic world did not respond with as much commitment as it did  justifiably  in the introduction of the values of democracy and the market economy. The world was insufficiently prepared for this epochal event. It is only now seeking and implementing models and mechanisms for overcoming and preventing the deterioration of relations between some of the new States. The London Conference  which tried to pave the way towards a political solution of the Balkan crisis  was a successful expression of this common search. The denial to the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Serbia and Montenegro - of participation in the General Assembly of the United Nations  a move that was supported by Slovenia  is convincing proof that the United Nations is capable of showing the necessary decisiveness in order to condemn the States that flagrantly violate the United Nations Charter and  above all  peace  security and human rights. After the final defeat and withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Slovenia a year ago  armed conflicts flared up ever further from Slovenia. In the process of seeking a solution  Slovenia has worked as a constructive and objective participant in the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia  unselfishly presided over by Lord Carrington  and now the London Conference  to which it is currently committed. Our most immediate and most direct interest is in the solution of humanitarian problems and  in particular  the situation of the more than 70 000 refugees in our country. Our other basic interest relates to the settlement of all issues of State succession of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It goes without saying that our ultimate objective is the establishment of a durable peace in the Balkans.  Slovenia is not in dispute with any of the nations of the former Yugoslavia. In accordance with the decisions of the London Conference  we support measures against the policies of Serbia and Montenegro and we oppose their attempt to usurp the succession of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is not hard to see that it was the recent policies of these two republics  which today go by the name of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  that caused the disintegration of Yugoslavia  by enforced domination over the others  by a reinforcement of a centralist and undemocratic political system  and by force and seizure; later by war  territorial conquest  ""ethnic cleansing""  concentration camps and other crimes which must be the subject of judicial investigation and trial; and finally by contempt for all the civilized values that form the basis of the Charter of the United Nations and key documents of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The Helsinki Final Act is undoubtedly one of those invaluable codes of behaviour a guide to the development of human rights  respect for borders and their openness and the protection of minorities which  through general respect  regulate the process of the democratization of relations between nations and States in a peaceful framework. The authorities of the former Yugoslavia did not really accept the Helsinki principles. They did not believe that signing the document bound them to respect them. The tragedy in the Balkans would not have occurred had the Helsinki principles been respected and implemented in the former Yugoslavia. It could have been avoided. Even once it had started  it could have been resolved peacefully precisely by respecting the Helsinki principles with the understanding that this might affect the political map of Europe. Such understanding would have prevented the damage  as well as the  simplifications and justifications that frequently attribute the crisis in the Balkans  and similar situations elsewhere  to irrational nationalist passion  nationalist animosities  tribalism and the like. Slovenia chose independence with its implementation of the right to self-determination. Slovenia proposed the peaceful dissolution of Yugoslavia in the manner advocated by Russia at the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union  when Russia supported the independence of all the republics of the former Soviet Union. Slovenia does not oppose modern movements towards integration. It supports them provided they are based  like the European Community  on respect for the interests of all those involved  and on equal cooperation and agreement. Slovenia wishes to join the European Community and is prepared voluntarily to surrender such parts of its sovereignty as all members of the European Community must surrender. Slovenia does not wish this only because of its need for economic integration  but also because of its historical affiliation with that culture  which was interrupted by catastrophic ideological  political and economic divisions after the Second World War. Ensuring durable international peace and security requires the fulfilment of certain conditions  among which respect for human rights is of critical significance. Those States that do not respect human dignity and human rights at home will not respect the dignity and sovereignty of other nations and other States. It is evident that threats to international peace very often start with violations of human rights within the boundaries of countries which later disturb the peace. The Republic of Slovenia attaches great importance to concern for the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. As a new  sovereign State  it is strongly committed to the view that in our times State  sovereignty is primarily defined by criteria of the legitimacy of State authority and respect for human rights. This is due above all to the practical importance of human rights as a guarantee of social stability and peace and thus as an important constituent of international peace and security. At a time when the setting of international standards in the field of human rights is being completed  concern for the effectiveness of their implementation and of international supervision is of high priority. Experience has shown that assuring respect for human rights  including especially the rights of persons belonging to national  ethnic  religious and linguistic minorities  is of critical importance for extinguishing crises and establishing peace. Efforts at post-conflict peace-building will be precarious and incomplete if that condition for stabilization is not fulfilled and supervised. The Secretary-General also fully stresses this in his important report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). There is one further question which highlights the need to review the suitability of institutional arrangements. This is the problem of refugees  as demonstrated in the war against Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is clear that an arrangement meeting the need to protect the personal status and integrity of an individual forced to abandon his country through fear of political and physical violence is inadequate for a mass exodus of entire nations fleeing threatened genocide as a result of a war of conquest and the ""ethnic cleansing"" of territory conquered by an aggressor. A million Muslim refugees from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina are without adequate protection and without an internationally guaranteed status. They are ever more widely scattered throughout Europe. There are close to 100 000 in my own country  which is  with great difficulty  providing them with food and shelter. The Bosnian Muslims are becoming a nation without a  land  without a State  with all the attendant tragic consequences  including repercussions for the protection of Europe against terrorism. It is of such hopelessness that terrorism is born. It is tragic that in this war against a State Member of the United Nations  composed of three nations  Croats  Muslims and Serbs  the Muslims should remain almost unprotected. That is why they seek refuge throughout Europe. At a number of international conferences we have proposed that United Nations peace-keeping forces create a safe haven in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself  where the relative safety of refugees would be assured  since  after the war  when decisions are made on the fate of that State  the Muslims must be present and active  physically and politically. The division of the State would otherwise become a reality. It would also be a reality that aggression had been rewarded by the allocation of conquered territory and that the world had recognized the policy of fait accompli and shut its eyes to violations of the principles of humanitarian rights  and to the perpetration of genocide. Of equal importance is an effective mechanism for prompt action in the resolution of humanitarian problems created by armed conflict. It is particularly important that the humanitarian assistance - in which the High Commissioner for Refugees  Mrs. Sadako Ogata  the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and its Executive Director  Mr. James Grant  and Under-Secretary-General Jan Eliasson have invested so much effort - be provided in a timely manner. The importance of humanitarian measures  even if they require overcoming resistance and military protection  has been demonstrated recently in some of the armed conflicts of the past year  including the conflicts in the Gulf and in the Balkans. Inability to guarantee humanitarian assistance is inexcusable and compromises the international community and  unfortunately  the United Nations.  In a period of eased international relations and a search for new orientations for development  there is an important way in which the potential role of the United Nations has been extended: in preventive diplomacy and the creation of measures which are a real contribution to defusing conflicts  dealing with their underlying causes and overcoming their consequences. Preventive diplomacy is a task for the future; it will require supplementing and reinforcing the work of the United Nations. It presupposes a knowledge of history and respect for the principles of the equality and self-determination of all peoples  and for other principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations. In their own interests and in the common interest  the Members of the United Nations will have to fulfill those principles. Only thus will the authority of the United Nations be enhanced and protected  and the hope which people  including the people of Slovenia  have invested in it be justified. The United Nations has alleviated  as far as it could  the negative effects of bloc rivalries and the bipolar division of the world. Now  the world needs a United Nations which is capable of guiding  harmonizing and assisting change. This can be achieved only if the Organization can revitalize  restructure and democratize its own system. We are firmly convinced that the United Nations  as a universal forum of multilateralism  will successfully take this unique opportunity to lay the foundations for a new and more just world  in building which the entire international community shares a common interest.  I have devoted a great deal of attention to the crisis in the Balkans. I should like  however  to stress that the Republic of Slovenia is also well aware of other problems that beset the world  and that it has a constructive approach to the important aspects of an international world order that will not be burdened by war  poverty  illiteracy  intolerance  and injustice; of an order in which the Declaration of the World Summit on Children and the achievements of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro will be implemented in full; and of an order in which human rights will everywhere be the standard of behaviour respected by States. Constructive and successful dialogue among developed and developing countries - as well as peace  international security  and disarmament - are among our priority tasks. I wish the the United Nations every success - success the world badly needs. "
"147",6538,"SWE",47,1992," I should like to offer you hearty congratulations on your election to the presidency. Sir. I am confident that this session of the General Assembly is in good hands. I should also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his leadership of the United Nations in an era of crucial change. It is a sign of the times that since last year no fewer than 13 new Member States have taken their seats in the General Assembly. I should like to extend a warm welcome to them all. The world is currently undergoing dramatic changes and facing great challenges. Let us not allow the optimism inspired by the revolution which brought freedom to Eastern Europe to turn into a new pessimism as a result of the problems we are facing today. The end of the cold war has definitely given us a unique opportunity to build a new world order founded on common values  as originally envisaged in the United Nations Charter. International consensus is emerging  based on the principles of democracy and a free economy as prerequisites for the prosperity of the peoples of the world. The President returned to the Chair. The first reason for my optimism is the end of the East-West conflict. The second reason is that experience has shown that no nation is condemned to a perpetual cycle of poverty  underdevelopment and political violence. Several developing countries have made remarkable progress from absolute poverty to relative prosperity in a very short time. In addition to traditional contributions from the industrial countries  we can observe a tendency for economically successful developing countries to share their know-how and experience with other countries which have not yet achieved the same level of growth. New forms of cooperation between nations at different stages of development are emerging. We are living in an era when the removal of the risk of a nuclear holocaust makes other threats to peace and security stand out all the more clearly. This applies to problems of economic development  to the growing threat to the environment  and to ethnic and religious conflicts which have become severely aggravated in certain areas. Even though security will continue to have a military dimension  these challenges can be met only by applying a broader security concept which takes all aspects into account. In the long term  problems and conflicts of this kind can be solved only in an environment where there is a greater focus on cooperation. This can be achieved through the free exchange of know-how and goods  through regional cooperation and through institution-building: the establishment and strengthening of international structures within and outside the United Nations system. In the future  the greatness of a nation will be measured not by its military potential but by its ability to create a civil society through peaceful cooperation. A world of open  civil societies must also be a world of open markets. In Western Europe  peace and prosperity have been consolidated and secured through the free flow of goods and services. In the same way  peace and prosperity in what is usually termed the third world can be achieved only by global free trade and more open frontiers. We in the West must do more than merely open up our markets. It is also our responsibility to support economic and social progress in the developing countries by giving generous assistance. Assistance is particularly important for the poorest countries which are not yet able to benefit fully from freer world trade. Sweden considers it essential that the Western industrial countries achieve the goal of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to development assistance. Development assistance must effectively promote respect for human rights  democracy and market-economy solutions. Unfortunately  increasing resources are needed also to help people who are suffering from famine  war and other disasters. Regional cooperation  which has been given new impetus following the end of East-West confrontation  will play an increasingly dynamic role in tomorrow's world. And  in its turn  regional cooperation can promote global cooperation. If opportunities for regional cooperation are utilized in the right manner  this cooperation will provide the bricks for building global integration. But if these opportunities are not handled properly  the result will be narrow-minded nationalism and economic protectionism. European integration and the reunification of Eastern and Western Europe on the basis of common values and aims have created new opportunities for pan-European cooperation. Future stability depends on the success of the transition in Eastern Europe and in the States of the Commonwealth of Independent States  which makes demands on European solidarity. A united and successful Europe can play an important and positive role at the international level. It is Sweden's firm intention to become a member of the European Community. As a member  Sweden will continue to work for a Europe which is open to the world  economically  culturally and politically. In our view  an introverted Europe is not a viable alternative. Environmental threats  natural disasters and terrorism will continue to present us with formidable challenges. Mass poverty and accelerating population growth still trouble many countries. Drug use and drug trafficking remain major concerns for the international community. We have seen that societies can break down both as a result of domestic problems and under external pressure. It is a fact that the massive flows of refugees which we see today are just as likely to be caused by human activities as by natural disasters. In Europe  we have been unable so far to stop the tragic developments in the former Yugoslavia. This is the most brutal conflict experienced in our region since the Second World War. Sweden is endeavouring to strengthen regional mechanisms and the international framework in order to deal with conflicts of the type we have seen in the Balkans  in Moldavia and in the Caucasus.  In its own vicinity  Sweden has focused on the risk of conflict inherent in the unregulated stationing of former Soviet troops in the sovereign Baltic States. We welcome the recent agreement on troop withdrawal reached by Russia and Lithuania and expect that similar agreements will be concluded with Estonia and Latvia as well. Although the end of the cold war has encouraged steps towards peaceful solutions  regional conflicts  often of long standing  continue to claim victims in many parts of the world. In parts of Africa  regional conflicts are aggravated by protracted drought  which has contributed to a famine affecting millions of people. No one can be indifferent to the situation in Somalia  where the civilian population has been hit harder than anywhere else. In other parts of the Horn of Africa as well  the inhabitants are suffering the effects of war. Sweden is participating in the ongoing international humanitarian relief measures by contributing substantial resources. However  humanitarian assistance must be combined with political efforts to establish a lasting peace. The positive features of developments in South Africa  where important steps have been taken towards a negotiated settlement  are overshadowed by political violence which is tending to create a vicious circle. The Swedish Government supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in contributing to an end to the violence and to resumed negotiations leading to the speedy abolishment of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic South Africa. The historic opportunity to achieve peace which has now opened up in the Middle East must not be lost. However  if peace is to have real content  there must be a comprehensive settlement including all the aspects discussed by the multilateral working parties within the framework of the peace process. The Middle East could greatly benefit from regional cooperation in a number of areas. When the parties to a conflict sit down at the negotiating table  a dynamic process of confidence-building is often created. We hope that such dynamic effects will occur  both in the political process in South Africa and in the peace process in the Middle East. Recent developments in the disarmament area have been particularly hopeful. In the past year  the United States and the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States concerned agreed to cut back their strategic nuclear stockpiles by two thirds and to eliminate most of their tactical nuclear weapons. The draft convention on a comprehensive ban on chemical weapons represents a historic achievement in international efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We hope that growing international consensus will lead to further effective measures to deal with weapons of mass destruction and their proliferation. Sweden pays particular attention to the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and to the strengthening and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a result of the 1995 Review Conference.  An important task for this session of the General Assembly is to follow up the decisions taken at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in June. Industrial and developing countries must work together in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity to deal with threats to our environment and to achieve environmentally sound development. A Swedish poet once wrote: ""What force may create is uneasy and brief"". This is also what history teaches. Lasting solutions to crises and conflicts caused by political and religious antagonisms must be based on the principles of democracy and international law. It is therefore in everyone's interest to safeguard the rule of international law  transcending national  ethnic  and religious frontiers. In Europe we have seen a welcome development of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). During the cold war the role of the CSCE was to build bridges. Its central task now is to support the Eastern European countries in their transition and to help these new States to find forms for peaceful coexistence. When Sweden assumes the chairmanship of the CSCE Council of Ministers in December  I intend to work for the further enhancement of the capacity of the CSCE to build peace and settle conflicts. Coordination between the United Nations and the CSCE was strengthened when the CSCE  in Helsinki  explicitly pronounced itself a regional organization as defined in the United Nations Charter. This is having a positive effect  for example on endeavours to solve the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Different forms of cooperative security between the United Nations and regional organizations are also being introduced in other conflict areas.  However  the United Nations has the fundamental responsibility for the interpretation and application of international law. Enforcement measures remain the prerogative of the United Nations. But the United Nations must be strengthened in important respects if it is to be able to meet the demands of today and the expectations of tomorrow. Sweden wants to contribute to this process. In the first instance  the peace-making  peace-keeping and peace-building capacity of the United Nations must be reinforced. This applies to the Security Council  which bears the main responsibility for peace and security under the Charter. It also applies to the Secretary-General  who should be given greater possibilities for taking initiatives. Regarding the strengthening of the Security Council  I am primarily thinking of the Council's possibilities for dealing with threats to international peace and security at an early stage. However  caution should be exercised in changing the Council's composition and its decision-making procedures  since the Council is now at long last functioning as the Charter intended. At the same time  it is important that the decisions of the Security Council continue to enjoy wide support from Member States. This requires close cooperation between members of the Security Council and other Members of the United Nations. Sweden welcomes the Secretary-General's report ""An Agenda for Peace"". Several of the proposals presented in his report were discussed by the Nordic countries in. an earlier document entitled: ""Shaping the Peace the United Nations in the 1990s"". In this document we appealed for  among other things  strengthening the Security Council's and the Secretary-General's capacities to undertake preventive diplomacy. It is gratifying to note that this issue has now been given the highest priority.  It is of the utmost importance that the United Nations be given concrete possibilities for anticipating and preventing conflicts. It should be possible to deploy peace-keeping forces for preventive purposes. The parties to a conflict should be urged to apply to the International Court of Justice for the peaceful settlement of their disputes. Violations of fundamental human rights can constitute a threat to international peace and security and hence be subject to measures by the Security Council. As regards the difficult question of the use of coercive measures to keep or build peace under Article 42 of the Charter  and the establishment of permanent United Nations forces on a national basis for this purpose  we have every reason carefully to follow and analyse these matters. Any change in United Nations practice must take place in the broadest possible agreement. The Secretary-General's report also contains proposals for financing traditional peace-keeping missions. The question of financing has become increasingly important as United Nations peace-keeping endeavours have been extended. Peace-keeping activities must not be based on the charity of Member countries  as has often been the case in the past. The Nordic countries have concluded that the establishment of a contingency fund for peace-keeping operations would constitute an important step towards solving the question of financing. But peace-keeping operations are only one aspect of the financing difficulties of the United Nations. If the United Nations is to be capable of fulfilling its role in the future  now that the political prerequisites exist  a long-term solution must be found for the Organization's financial crisis. Furthermore  all Member States must pay their assessed contributions in accordance with their obligations under the Charter.  We are gratified to note that the broader security concept which Sweden advocates is included in ""An Agenda for Peace"". This view should be the basis for the reform of the whole United Nations system. In his report to this year's session of the Economic and Social Council  the Secretary-General has further developed his thoughts on this issue. His central message is that a distinction cannot and should not be made between United Nations tasks in the political sphere and those in the economic and social fields. Sweden supports this view. In this context  the proposal to hold a world summit for social development in 1995 takes on particular significance. In the Nordic United Nations project  several concrete proposals are presented for making the work of United Nations development assistance more effective for example  through a new governance structure and a new financing system. We welcome the first step taken by the General Assembly in strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to respond to humanitarian emergencies. Following the July session of the Economic and Social Council  we hope that it will be possible to proceed successfully with the reform measures in the economic and social fields during this session of the General Assembly. The protection of human rights is also included in the broader security concept. In preparation for next year's United Nations Conference on Human Rights  Sweden intends to work for measures and procedures which can increase respect for human rights throughout the world  both in developing countries and in industrial countries. Let me stress that the Swedish Government considers that there is a clear connection between respect for fundamental human rights and economic and social development. Consequently  the question of a country's development cannot be divorced from its implementation of respect for human rights.  Sweden is presenting its candidature for a seat on the United Nations Security Council for the 1993-1994 period of office. We are doing so on the basis of the active role we have traditionally played in the United Nations system. In the election of non-permanent members of the Council  the Charter prescribes that due regard be paid to the contribution of Members to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the Organization.  Many Swedes have served the United Nations  both in the Secretariat and in the field. Names such as Folke Bernadotte and Dag Hammarskjold are part of United Nations history. Sweden has participated in practically all United Nations peace-keeping operations. On the basis of our experience in this area  we and the other Nordic countries can offer advice and training to countries which are now preparing for peace-keeping missions. Sweden placed the problems of the environment on the agenda of the United Nations. It hosted the first United Nations Conference in this area. For many years  we have been in the vanguard of the United Nations work in the economic and social sphere  both as regards planning and financing. Sweden is a major donor to many of the United Nations development agencies and the fourth-largest contributor to the United Nations system as a whole. If Sweden wins support for its candidature for a seat on the United Nations Security Council  it will entail greater responsibility than was the case when we participated in the work of the Council sixteen years ago. We are prepared to shoulder this responsibility. In an international environment which presents new challenges and opportunities for cooperation  Sweden's United Nations policy can be summarized in the following three points. First  we want to contribute to the reinforcement of United Nations peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-building ca¬£ability. This is a question of maintaining the Security Council's effectiveness  which also assumes that its decisions enjoy the wide support of Member States. The Secretary-General should be given greater possibilities to take initiatives. It is essential that the financing of peace-keeping operations be guaranteed. Sweden supports the proposal for the establishment of a special contingency fund. Secondly  we want to work for an extension of international structures for cooperation to enable us to meet the threats to peace  security and economic development in the 1990s. We attach great importance to the interaction between the United Nations and regional organizations. Thirdly  we want to promote the application of a broader security concept which contains not merely a military component but also human rights  democracy  economic freedom  social justice and environmental responsibility. We support the view that United Nations tasks in the political sphere and in the economic and social field must be considered in the same context. A comprehensive view of this nature  based on the United Nations Charter  should form the basis for reform of the United Nations system. The United Nations can establish genuine security in the world. It can do so only by tackling the roots of insecurity. "
"148",6576,"SWZ",47,1992,"May I begin  on behalf of His Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majesty the Indlovukazi - the Queen Mother and the whole Swazi nation  by conveying to you all the greetings and good wishes of the Kingdom of Swaziland. I offer my country's sincerest congratulations to Mr. Ganev on his well-deserved election to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at this forty-seventh session. We are most confident in his ability to guide deliberations in this distinguished gathering towards successful conclusions. Allow me also to express Swaziland's gratitude to his predecessor  Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  for his extremely effective leadership as President at the forty-sixth session  during which much valuable work was conducted. Our thanks and admiration are also due to the members of the Bureau  whose role in the day-to-day activities is central to the success of the Assembly. I should also like to take this opportunity to express Swaziland's appreciation of the outstanding service given this Organization by the former Secretary-General  Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose diplomatic experience and dynamic leadership contributed so much to the re-emergence of the United Nations as the only international institution with the influence to improve social  economic and political standards throughout the world. Our congratulation  too  go to his successor  our new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  who has already shown the experience  diplomacy and wisdom necessary to make a success of this most important and challenging post. We wish him strength through God's held and blessing as he continues to lead us in these difficult times. This year has seen the admission of new Member States  once again demonstrating the principle of extending the advantages of membership to all who desire to embrace our founding Charter. We welcome our new Members  and we are confident that their presence will contribute substantially towards this new age of international understanding and cooperation  as we strive to attain universal harmony. Many obstacles remain in the way of true international peace and stability but  as has been shown in the past  with the release of East-West tension and the subsequent removal of the atmosphere of fear and mistrust which had so clouded past deliberations  this forum remains our one hope in our search for acceptable solutions to the many challenges that confront us. Although the Kingdom of Swaziland remains  thankfully  peaceful and stable  it is a fact that  in these times of global interdependence  we are subject to  and affected by  the pressures or events occurring outside our borders; not just in our own subregion but also by the tragedies and crises occurring throughout the world. The role of the United Nations as the most powerful and influential body for immediate humanitarian aid  and as the most acceptable international broker for peace  continues to stretch our collective resources to the utmost. The priorities for our efforts become ever harder to define  as the incidence of disaster and conflict  with their corresponding calls on our resources  appear to increase. We in Swaziland accept our responsibility  through our membership of the United Nations  to lend our support wherever the call for humanitarian aid  and assistance to end the bloodshed of a conflict  is made  regardless of our direct or indirect involvement in those situations. Our regular and prompt payment of dues testifies to our commitment to this policy  and we are proud of our record. The various unresolved conflicts on our own continent are  of course  of primary consideration to us  and of immediate concern is the situation affecting our neighbour. South Africa. We have watched as the momentous changes of the last two years have brought the inevitable ebb and flow of hope and despair. We have been constant in our support of a peaceful process  through negotiation  towards the establishment of a new South Africa whose guiding principles would be acceptable to all partners  and we have been reassured by the words and actions of the United Nations in its acceptance of that goal. We have suffered along with the victims  many of Swazi origin  of the terrible violence that continues to plague the peace process; and we welcomed the initiative of the United Nations in dispatching a team of observers  under the capable leadership of the distinguished Special Envoy  Mr. Virendra Dayal  to assess the violence in the townships. We are confident that they will successfully bring to bear their collective expertise and experience in helping to resolve this most distressing problem. Swaziland now urges all political leaders in South Africa to put aside their differences and to return to the negotiating table in a spirit of compromise and conciliation for the sake of their country and for the future of their children. We in southern Africa can only pray that there will be an early  peaceful conclusion of the process  so that we too can benefit from the advantages that closer social and economic links with a new South Africa will inevitably bring us and the other countries of the subregion. The situation within the borders of our other neighbour  Mozambique  offers at last some ray of hope for an early resolution  and our support for the processes of peace there seem finally to have been rewarded. Swaziland wishes to express its deepest admiration and praise for all those involved in the peace negotiations between FRELIMO and RENAMO  which resulted in the momentous accord signed in Rome last month. In particular  the efforts of the Governments of Italy  Portugal and the United States  and the individual contribution of His Excellency President Robert Mugabe  deserve our applause. But without the commitment of both sides of the dispute to peaceful settlement  the assistance and advice of these international friends would have been worthless. We salute the initiatives of both parties and entreat them to carry through the undertakings of the accord without further bloodshed and with a determination to regain the peace which has so long been denied the Mozambican people. The crisis in Mozambique has a great and direct bearing on our own situation. At least 80 000 Mozambican refugees currently enjoy Swazi hospitality at continuing great expense to our national economy in the form of resources in land  finance  employment opportunities and other social  services. We  and indeed the refugees themselves  look forward to the resumption of a secure and peaceful atmosphere in Mozambique so that  repatriation can reasonably take place and thus relieve the pressure of the  substantial burden that is being carried by us. Just as we continue to rely on the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian agencies for help in coping with these unfortunate victims  so we shall be looking for assistance when the time comes for them to return home. We are confident that we  and the refugees  deserve such aid. Swaziland welcomed the end of hostilities in Angola  and we would like to express our appreciation to those whose efforts brought the crisis to an end. We now join the rest of the international community in praying for a successful election process so that all Angolans will be able to reap the benefits of peace. The horrifying situation in Somalia continues to give us cause for grave concern. The almost unbelievable proportions of the disastrous effects of famine and the continuing interfactional fighting beg action on an international scale. We fully support all United Nations efforts to bring relief to the starving  suffering millions. Words mean little in such circumstances  but the people of Somalia should know that our prayers are with them; with God's blessing and with positive assistance from us  they will pull through this dark episode in their country's history. The situations in Chad  the Sudan and Liberia also give little cause for hope for early solutions. Again  we pledge our full support to all efforts to bring about peaceful and lasting solutions to these problems which affect the stability of our continent. In Europe  too  the ravages and upheaval of war and social change have had their devastating effect. The situation in former Yugoslavia in particular gives immediate cause for concern  with the ongoing war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the crises of uncertainty in the other newly-independent States. The efforts of the United Nations and the European Community to bring about peace are to be applauded and they deserve our fullest support. We pray that sense will prevail amongst the leaders of different factions and that use will be made of the negotiating table in bringing about an early end to the horrific bloodshed in this unfortunate corner of Europe. We applaud the work of the United Nations Special Envoy  Mr. Cyrus Vance  and that of the European representative. Lord Owen  in their extremely difficult task as intermediaries. The performance of the multinational monitoring force  operating under the most frustrating and challenging conditions  is also in the best United Nations traditions and deserves our admiration and praise. Swaziland has been watching with great interest  and not a little optimism  the developments over the last year in the Middle East. The disputes and conflicts in this important area have for too long been the cause of international concern  and we welcome all efforts to bring about an atmosphere in which all parties can resolve their differences. The Government of the United States of America  in particular  deserves mention in its determination to get the Middle East peace initiative up and running. Moreover  the latest conciliative remarks by His Excellency  the new Israeli Prime Minister  with the correspondingly constructive responses from the affected countries  give cause for encouragement that our prayers for positive steps towards the achievement of lasting peace in the whole region may at last be answered. Much  of course  remains to be done  but we can only support and encourage all initiatives towards the achievement of this aim. Swaziland is distressed to hear of the latest disasters which have afflicted some areas of Pakistan  Bangladesh  the Philippines  the United States of America and other countries in different parts of the world. The disasters which have caused so many thousands of deaths and destroyed the homes of millions constitute a crisis of unprecedented proportions. We join others in the international community in pledging our moral support for immediate substantial aid to relieve the suffering and to help rebuild the shattered economies of these areas. Swaziland joined the rest of the United Nations last year in welcoming the two Koreas as Members of our Organization. The resolution of the crisis between these two countries has been on our agenda for a long time  and Swaziland welcomes and supports any initiative to bring about an atmosphere of conciliation and peace between them. We call on the people of Afghanistan to use the present opportunity for peace to bury any divisive differences between them and to move on with the task of national reconciliation and economic development so that all may enjoy the hard-won fruits of peace. In Cambodia  we have welcomed the efforts of our sizeable United Nations presence in assisting with the consolidation of positive trends towards peace and stability. We look forward to having a unified Cambodia add its influential support in the restoration of peace throughout the region of Indo-China. In these and other conflicts around the world  the United Nations has distinguished itself in trying to act as brokers for peace and as the provider of humanitarian aid. This has been achieved  often in the most hazardous and difficult circumstances  but with an increasing rate of success and with the noblest intentions of creating a safer  more stable world. To that end  the  initiatives towards limiting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are of paramount importance in our efforts to bring about true international peace and harmony  and Swaziland gives these efforts its fullest support. The pressing issue of the environment was important enough to attract all members of the United Nations family to the Earth summit in Brazil earlier this year. The commitment shown there by all participants  and ratified by a number of far-reaching treaties  to address the multiple problems posed by man's thoughtlessness and ignorance was fully justified and was a timely reminder of how much irreparable damage we have already caused. For us in Swaziland  the Summit served as a catalyst in our efforts to become more aware of our environmental responsibilities  and we are now taking those responsibilities very seriously indeed. In fact  no greater reminder of our own reliance on our natural resources was needed  as we found ourselves in the middle of the worst drought on record. It is ironic that  as we strive as a nation to develop along the right paths and as our economic base becomes more and more dependent on increasingly sophisticated industrial development  it takes the failure of a basic natural resource to make us realize how complete our reliance still is on the basic gifts of nature and how carefully we must nurture our country's precious resources to ensure that future generations inherit a fruitful and productive land. We are indebted to the United Nations for its prompt response in convening the successful pledging conference in Geneva in June to benefit those who have been hardest hit by the drought  and our gratitude is also due those in the international community that responded so generously. But a short-term response is not enough. We in the region have recognized that our emphasis must now be on ensuring that we are adequately prepared for any such natural disaster in the future. We shall be looking to the Organization for advice and assistance so that our people may never again suffer as they have this past season. One principle to which Swaziland is attaching increasing importance is the linkage of our nation's development  both social and economic  to a dependence on closer cooperation with our regional partners. Social development is inextricably linked to economic performance  and the eradication of many of our national social problems  such as poverty  unemployment  crime and the like  depends on improvement in our economic situation. Our membership in such regional organizations as the Preferential Trade Area Authority and the Southern African Development Coordination Conference and the Treaty signed recently at the Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in Abuja  establishing the African Economic Community  point out our strong commitment to improving our economic performance through closer economic and trade cooperation with the rest of our continent. Those organizations and initiatives are serious attempts by Africans  for the benefit of Africa  to pull themselves out of the economic and social quagmire of recent years. We deserve and expect the support  encouragement and positive assistance of the international community if we are to make a success of it and thereby reduce future dependence on the developed world. Africa is disturbed to see much-needed developmental funds being diverted to other targets  and while Swaziland  for one  is making every effort to prepare itself to stand on its own  our country and others in our subregion are still in desperate need of continuing assistance in many areas  precisely so that we shall be able to establish the mechanisms and organizations that will allow Africa to be self-sufficient in the future. Swaziland hopes and prays that Africa will not be neglected now at a time when assistance is most needed. That fact has been driven forcefully home to us with the production of the latest World Economic Survey  which  as is inevitable in the midst of an international economic recession  has once more painted a miserable picture for developing countries. For Africa  in particular  the litany of depressing economic news makes for distressing reading. One area of particular concern to us as we strive to become less dependent on the developed world is the widening gap between North and South  between the primary-commodity producers and the manufacturers of finished products  a situation exacerbated by the protectionist trade policies employed by some and by the inability to bring to a successful conclusion  so far  the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those are some of the areas which inhibit the release of the developing world from the chains of dependence on the developed countries. We appeal to all to address these problems in the only way that will produce results: in the spirit of true international brotherhood within this family of nations. Our Organization has much to be proud of and much still left to do. The United Nations remains the only truly global forum in which the world's problems can be discussed and from which the collective experience and expertise of all our Member nations can be pooled to find solutions. Swaziland is proud to count itself one among this illustrious company and  on behalf of His Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majesty the Indlovukazi and the whole Swazi nation  I have the honour of once more reaffirming my Kingdom's commitment to the guiding principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. May almighty God watch over the deliberations of the Assembly and reward it with the success it deserves. "
"149",6610,"SYC",47,1992,"We should first like to congratulate Mr. Ganev on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. Barely a year ago  the representatives of the United Nations  meeting in this same Hall  ventured to believe that a new era of peace  cooperation and understanding was being established. We glimpsed on the horizon a new order in which each would be recognized  in which all nations  large and small  would have equal responsibilities and obligations in mutual respect. We believed that. We really believed that  because the mood was one of optimism. After all  the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait had marked the triumph of legitimacy. Then  bloc confrontation being over  it was time for dialogue  since ideological antagonism had been overcome. Today  the world is again experiencing upheavals and disruption. We are seeing States imploding. Peoples are plagued by hunger  destitution and poverty. We are powerless witnesses to this grim spectacle  whereas we should be the artisans of change. Who can deny the seriousness of all this? Noble ideas  lofty sentiments and good intentions are not enough for the well-being of humankind. Perhaps I should add: ""are no longer enough"". This is an obvious fact and should provide a basic tenet for our work. We must all show our interest in it  so that our destiny might express our determination. The world is changing  and in order to control these changes  we are building the new order. This is a voluntary endeavour  based on the respect of nations  on partnership  on interdependence. But who would deny that the new world order has something of a colossus with feet of clay? On what kind of world will this system be modelled? More than 4 billion human beings live in poor countries. Whereas the rich nations  with about 15 per cent of the world's population  control more than 80 per cent of the world's income  about 60 per cent of humankind live in low-income countries  and more than 3 billion people possess only 5 per cent of the total income. With a population of more than 450 million  sub-Saharan Africa has less than 1 per cent of the world's income. Can we accept the exclusion of these millions of human beings? It is as if history had speeded up  had shaken up our ways of thinking  leaving our minds all confused. It is as if fragility had become the watchword of human adventure. No! At a time when we are all committed to building this new world order  stronger solidarity is needed more than ever  because poverty is not inevitable  nor is it a genetic defect. The challenge is daunting. Short-term  stopgap solutions are not enough. We simply must radically change the attitude and behaviour of the industrialized world to the chronic plight of many countries in the South. In order to do this  there can be no double standards  tacit tolerance for some and vague promises for others. Have we the right today to denounce the corruption  abuse and lapses that are widespread in many developing countries  considering that these same practices were not so long ago tolerated and even encouraged by some? Can we welcome the changes that have occurred and I am referring to the democratization of institutions even though in many cases they are accompanied by chaos and suffering? Nevertheless  we must not underestimate the contribution that the international community is entitled to expect from each country  considered as it is to be an artisan of its own development. Each must  in particular  establish institutions and procedures compatible with the rights and obligations that all must now shoulder  regardless of level of development. But what are we to think  what are we to say about the increasing tensions between the industrialized North  certain that it is in the right  and the South  which gets poorer all the time  plagued by contradiction and seeking  sometimes clumsily  fresh sources of relief? How sincere is the wealth of advice given in the options suggested  the guidelines prescribed? Are we not in a diktat situation when we hear the following: ""Adopt reforms  democratize your institutions  go ahead and liberalize your economies. Then  and only then  will we help you."" What developing country seeking an evolutive process has not been on the receiving end of this kind of message? How few  without adapting  have managed to adopt new  realistic and productive policies? There is no single model exportable to all. There is no absolute model that works for everyone. It is in the name of principles and experiments  all too often garbled within the framework of open-economy programmes and democratization  that crushing failures have occurred. Has the debt burden been eased? Have commodity export earnings in the third world increased? Clearly  one figure speaks for all the others: that of the aid given by rich countries to the poorer ones. Logically  it shows the importance attached by the donors to the development projects they are supposed to support. But the figures are rarely commensurate with their lofty ambitions; that we must admit.  Can it be expected by any chance of the smaller countries in particular that they should use other means to generate the resources necessary for their own development? This would be to ignore the economic fact of interaction and interdependence  which are difficult to manage and cannot really be the sole responsibility of these small countries. In seeking financial assistance  expertise and transfers of technology  we are trying first to encourage international solidarity  without excluding anyone and within as broad a context as possible. Was not that the great lesson of Rio  despite the flaws and imperfections of political dialogue  in that it reminded those who had been tempted to forget that everything is global nowadays for better or for worse  as in marriage where reason prevails over emotion? However  despite the urgent need for proper solutions  four months after the Rio Conference we are once again deploring the inertia of political dialogue  the complaisance of declarations of intent and the lack of perseverance in following up decisions. The right to make a mistake is not enshrined in any constitution  and yet are not famine  war and environmental disasters to name just three of the worst scourges monumental mistakes? Silence denotes guilt. We must not quibble or condemn here. We must agree on what we can do - together."
"150",6651,"SYR",47,1992,"It gives me great pleasure  on behalf of the Syrian delegation  to congratulate the new President on his election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly  particularly as our two countries and peoples enjoy bonds of traditional friendship. I should also like to express our appreciation to your predecessor  the permanent representative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for the success and skill with which he presided over the proceedings of the previous session of the General Assembly. May we wish his sisterly country progress and prosperity. I should also like to take this opportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General of the United Nations our confidence and our appreciation of his unremitting efforts in the service of the international community and the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter. In that respect  we value the effort that has gone into the preparation of his report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" and many of the valuable ideas contained therein. As is customary in this forum  we welcome the new States Members which have joined our international Organization and hope that their new membership will contribute to the process of enhancing its effectiveness and strengthening its role in formulating more democratic and equitable international relations. For the third time  the twentieth century witnesses an important change in the political map of the world. The change is such that schools and libraries all over the world have become in need of a new atlas  just as they had in the wake""of the two World Wars. We fear that  because of the continuing upheavals in the world the designers of that new atlas may have to leave a wide margin for possible new changes that may occur in the map of this planet as it crosses the threshold into the twenty-first century. Fortunately  that great change in the political map of the world has not taken place through war  as was the case in the two previous instances. Otherwise  it would have meant the end of all life on earth. Regrettably  however  the change has not been totally devoid of tension and violence. It has carried the seeds of small-scale wars that have spread here and there for national  ethnic  religious  tribal  economic and social reasons. At this historic juncture  the real concern is not only the number of victims claimed by such small wars or the scale of the destruction that may ensue  but rather  the possibility of the spread of the seeds of those small wars  in the North as well as in the South  in the absence of a world order that is capable of containing and addressing their causes. This is the major challenge which faces the United Nations today. It would be paradoxical indeed if the twentieth century  whose grand bang of scientific and cultural achievements have been hailed by all  were to end with the whimper of small was that are waged by people with small primitive minds the international community cannot curb. Many have rightly spoken of the non-implementation of United Nations resolutions and of the paralysis of its Security Council during the years of the cold war that used to rage between East and West. But the cold war has in effect been over for a few years now  and its demise has been officially declared by both sides. And yet  we find that the ultimate ambition of the Security Council today is no longer to stop the fighting and put an end to the massacres in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Somalia  Afghanistan and other hotbeds of tension and conflict  but merely to try and deliver humanitarian assistance to some of the peoples of those unfortunate countries. The end of confrontation between East and West ought not to lead to the end of concern for the fate of the many peoples and countries which are being torn apart by conflicts  as is happening today in Bosnia and Herzegovina  Somalia  Afghanistan and other places; nor should it lead to the withholding from their peoples of the assistance that would help heal their wounds and enable them to reconstruct what has been destroyed by conflict and war. If only a very small percentage of the sums that used to be spent by the two camps on the cold War were channelled to the assistance of peoples of the third world  such a small percentage would make it possible to overcome most of the difficulties and tragedies those peoples now face and to avoid further such disputes. At a time when the world witnesses the disintegration of whole States and the outbreak of civil wars and conflicts  one must appreciate the exceptional efforts that led to saving the Lebanese people from the inferno of civil war and helping them on the road to national reconciliation through the efforts of the Lebanese themselves and the brotherly assistance and sacrifices of Syria. We hope that pledges made to reconstruct what the civil war destroyed in Lebanon and to contribute to the special fund created for that purpose will be honoured. Since the end of the Second World War  the Middle East has enjoyed neither security nor stability because of the continuing Arab-Israeli conflict and its repercussions. But the convening of the Madrid conference last year has opened for the first time  as all acknowledge  a rare and historic window of opportunity to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on international legality and the resolutions of the United Nations  particularly Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978)  which  according to the Charter of the United Nations  are binding and must be implemented by all parties to the conflict. Almost a year has passed now since the convening of the Madrid conference. Ten months after the conference  the whole world came to realize that the peace talks between the Arabs and the Israelis were futile  because of the intransigence and the evasiveness of the previous head of the Israeli Government  who admitted publicly after his defeat in the elections that his intention was to go on quibbling and prevaricating with the purpose of prolonging the negotiations for 10 more years. It is also regrettable that the latest round of peace talks was concluded in Washington without the Israeli side changing the substance of its approach to the question of a full withdrawal from the Golan and the other occupied Arab territories  including Al-Quds  despite the readiness of Syria and the other Arab parties to commit themselves to all that is required of them in conformity with Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). It appears that the change in policies and priorities claimed by Mr. Rabin's Government in comparison with those of Mr. Shamir's Government to date lacks both credibility and actual application. The fact of the matter is that the great expectations and noticeable momentum which accompanied the latest round of negotiations were a result of the earnest contribution of the Arab side and the great impact of the Syrian document at both the regional and international levels. That comprehensive document contains the bases and principles of a peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict in conformity with the Charter and resolutions of the United Nations  which were the basis for the convening of the Madrid Conference. The international community has affirmed that the achievement of peace in the Middle East has always been and continues to be rooted in the inevitability of Israel's withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories that were occupied by force and war  and in securing the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. Those in Israel who believe that total peace can be achieved without a complete Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories are gravely mistaken. Those who also believe that the Israeli arsenal of mass destruction and its qualitative military edge can make it immune to the repercussions of the end of the cold war are equally mistaken. Saturating Israel with destructive and sophisticated weaponry cannot guarantee the true security of Israel as long as it continues to occupy the territories of others by force and to violate the rights of the Palestinian people  and as long as it lacks the human compass that may guide it to the shores of peace and security. The road to a comprehensive  just and durable peace is clear and well defined; it remains for Israel to choose to take it. Any manoeuvres of partial withdrawals or interim steps will not bring peace either to the region or to Israel itself. The higher level meetings Israel demands are merely a ploy that is meant to undermine the framework and mechanism within which the Arab and Israeli parties met at the Madrid Peace Conference. As declared by its leader. President Hafez Al-Assad  Syria wants an honourable peace which our people would accept  a peace in which not a grain of sand of our land is lost  no concession of any of our rights is made  and without dereliction of the duty of safeguarding the dignity of our nation. We want the peace of the brave  the peace that survives and lasts and guarantees the interests of all. But if there are to be games and ambushes no one could make Syria forsake its patriotic and national stand. There is no place for capitulation in our dictionary. We have already voiced our readiness for a complete peace in return for a complete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and we reaffirm that now. That is our challenge to Israel from this rostrum  a challenge that has found no response to this day. If comprehensiveness and justice were observed in arms control it would undoubtedly contribute to the consolidation of the security and stability we all long for. The subject of arms control would come within reach and be more effective in ensuring security and stability in the Middle East if it were based on the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction  with nuclear weapons first and foremost  in accordance with criteria which have no bias in favour of one State at the expense of another and which apply to all countries of the region without exception within the framework of the United Nations and under its auspices. Syria has never spared any effort in supporting United Nations resolutions and conventions relating to disarmament  particularly the non-proliferation Treaty to which Syria has acceded. Syria also signed the non-proliferation Treaty safeguards agreement on 25 February 1992. Syria has signed the Treaty on the prohibition of biological weapons and has consistently supported the initiative to make the Middle East region free of all nuclear weapons. Syria was the first officially to suggest at the 1989 Paris Conference on chemical weapons that the Middle East should be free of all chemical and biological weapons and weapons of mass destruction. At a time when the whole world knows that Israel is the only State in the region to possess nuclear weapons in addition to its possession of other weapons of mass destruction  Israel has to date refused to accede to the non-proliferation Treaty and has also refused for decades to allow inspection of its nuclear installations and continues to do so today. The logical option for all peoples of the world is to ensure security for all through complete disarmament and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. The measures adopted by the Conference on Disarmament in relation to the conclusion of a draft convention on the prohibition  development  production  stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and their destruction will remain short of realizing the ambitions of the international community so long as they are not coupled with a similar prohibition on nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The situation in South Africa continues to be a source of deep concern for my country. While we express our satisfaction over the repeal and amendment of some of the basic laws of apartheid  we would also like to express our deep concern over the persistence of repression and violence that the Government of South Africa continues to perpetrate against the population  at a great cost in victims to that population. Syria strongly supports the demands of the overwhelming majority of the people of South Africa for the establishment of a democratic and non-racial society. Concerning Cyprus  we welcome the efforts of the Secretary-General to find a just and lasting solution to the Cypriot problem based on United Nations resolutions and taking into account the interests of the parties to the conflict. Concerning the Korean peninsula  we reaffirm our support for the efforts of Democratic Korea to reunite the Korean peninsula peacefully and through negotiations. This would lead to prosperity for the entire Korean people while consolidating peace and stability in North-East Asia. In view of all the issues and problems with which the international community is occupied  some of which I have mentioned in my statement  the peoples and countries of the world are looking to our international Organization to contribute towards the establishment of a world of peace and security. We believe that  in order to be able to realize the aspirations and hopes of the peoples of the world for instituting a new world order in which there is no aggression or occupation and which is based on international legality and the rules of international law  the United Nations must apply the provisions of its own Charter and implement its resolutions without bias  selectivity or double standards. As we find ourselves on the threshold of the twenty-first century  we hope to be able to reach a world of peace and justice in which stability and prosperity would prevail. "
"151",6696,"TCD",47,1992,"In addressing the General Assembly this afternoon from this rostrum  I should like first of all to offer Mr. Ganev my warmest congratulations on his unanimous election as President for the forty-seventh session. His great experience is unquestionably a most valuable assurance for the international community during this tumultuous period in the world  a world which is seeking peace  security and well-being. He can count on the strong support and the full cooperation of the Chadian delegation  which it is my privilege to head. Ambassador Samir Shihabi  his predecessor  won our admiration with the tact and skill with which he handled the serious questions that arose during the period of his mandate. We express to him our fullest appreciation for his valuable contribution.  Less than 10 months after the beginning of his term of office  the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has put his stamp on the Organization and has been called upon to play a role of growing importance in the life of free peoples and nations. We wish him ever-greater successes and offer him our support in the execution of his weighty duties. We have no doubt he will discharge his tasks with his well-known skill and tenacity. I should also like to extend a warm welcome to the new Members of the Organization. Their presence here cannot but strengthen the universality of the United Nations  the goal of whose founding fathers was to bring together all peoples  put an end to the scourge of war and other forms of conflict  and above all to ensure socio-economic development and fraternity among men. At the last session of the General Assembly my delegation set forth the changes that had taken place in Chadian politics. We announced the enactment of the law on the conditions for the creation and functioning of political parties in the framework of pluralistic democracy and on the holding of a national sovereign conference scheduled for May 1992. It goes without saying that a meeting of such crucial importance for the future of the country had to be most carefully and rigorously prepared if optimum results were to be achieved. Thus  it was not possible to convene the conference on the scheduled date because the commission in charge of preparations for it did not submit its conclusions in time. Today I am in a position to announce from this rostrum that the Chad's national sovereign conference will take place during the first quarter of 1993  at the latest. This is a solemn commitment and one that has been repeatedly reaffirmed. Similarly  I reiterate here and now that the democratic process under way in my country is irreversible. Looking forward to this important date  and with a desire to bring together the largest possible number of our fellow citizens in the daily management of the affairs of the State  President Idriss Deby decided  after long consultations  to modify the National Charter which has governed Chad since 4 March 1991. On this basis  Mr. Joseph Yodoyman  a member of the opposition  has been appointed Prime Minister and Head of Government. The new Government includes both representatives of the opposition parties and representatives of ordinary citizens. This forward-looking government has set for itself the objective of pursuing the orientation plan presented to the donors and sponsors of Chad in Geneva in June 1990. Stress has been laid on disengagement of the State  privatization  liberalization of the economy and sector-based development  with priority given to competence and experience in the administration and to maintaining a dialogue with our social partners. Like many other countries on the continent  Chad is confronting an unprecedented economic and financial crisis. To deal with the crisis  the Government adopted a number of measures to stabilize public finances. These measures included: an increase in individual income taxes; a 50 per cent decrease in compensation given to all governmental and related workers; a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in indexed income; a 20 per cent reduction in lump-sum income; a 10 per cent reduction of the numbers working in public administration; and a reduction in State spending. These measures  which affect workers in both the public and the private sectors  encountered the vigorous opposition of the trade unions  leading to days of strikes in May  June  July and August 1992. Although the strikes were conducted lawfully  the Government had no choice but to maintain these measures  the overriding necessity of which was repeatedly underscored in the face of limited national resources. To make it possible for these measures to have effect  the Government is at the present time negotiating with social partners a social truce that will apply to the rest of the year. The Chadian people  officials and agents of the public and private sectors have a moral obligation to endure these sacrifices if they are to be able to look forward to the future with greater hope and serenity. With a view to reducing expenditures and establishing balance  the Government is pursuing its programme of restructuring the army. In this respect a protocol agreement has been signed with France which should make it possible to reduce the army from 50 000 to 25 000 men and to integrate all forces into a truly national army. This means that the French Government is giving us technical and financial assistance in this tremendous undertaking. In connection with this programme  my country has not lost sight of questions of security at the regional level  and we have taken part in subregional cooperative meetings in this regard. At the initiative of the 10 States members of Central Africa  the United Nations General Assembly adopted by consensus on 6 December 1991 resolution 46/37 B entitled ""Regional confidence-building measures"". In keeping with this resolution  on 28 May 1992 the Secretary-General of the United Nations announced the creation of the Permanent Consultative Committee on Questions of Security in Central Africa. The Committee is charged with developing confidence-building measures  promoting the limitation of armaments and furthering development in the subregion of Africa. From 27-30 July 1992  in Yaounde  Cameroon  the Committee held its organizational meeting at the ministerial level  with the assistance of the Office of Disarmament Affairs of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs. In its final report on this meeting  the Committee laid down  among other measures within the framework of peace-building  assistance for restructuring the army and providing new job training to military personnel. We place tremendous hopes in the results of this meeting and expect eventually to benefit from this assistance as we endeavour completely to reorganize our army. During the most critical periods of its history Chad has always enjoyed the invaluable support of the international community  and the Chadian people and Government are particularly grateful for this. Today again we urge all our partners to help us to carry out our ongoing stabilization programmes  and to stimulate economic activity in the country. These programmes have been laid down in a political context that has not always been conducive to the process of democratization that had been begun. Indeed  there have been here and there pockets of resistance to change  leading to instances of rebellion that have been put down thanks to the Government's policy of reaching out and promoting dialogue. Several peace agreements have thus been signed with rebellious movements  with the support of friendly countries  which deserve our heartfelt gratitude. Our joy at the ending of the cold war  which led to the beginning of a fruitful dialogue in the Security Council  is matched by our concern at a resurgence of certain problems such as injustice  ultranationalism  racism and religious fundamentalism  all of which are potential sources of conflict. The Chadian delegation would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his report  ""An Agenda for Peace""  which gives us valuable guidelines towards achieving a more secure  peaceful and just world. But  as I said  there remain many sources of potential concern. In Europe  for example  an area that had been spared violent upheavals thus far/ we are now helplessly witnessing a situation that defies the conscience of the world. The breakup of the former Yugoslavia could have led to relationships other than those based on war  particularly since the birth of that country had been accompanied by much suffering. We denounce practices such as ""ethnic cleansing""  a notion we had thought definitively eradicated from the language of modern nations. Chad believes that  whether in the States that have emerged from the former Yugoslavia or elsewhere  our conduct should be guided by the hallowed principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of all other related instruments. On the other hand  the Chadian delegation welcomes the evolution of the situation in Cambodia and expresses the hope that this most ambitious operation undertaken by the United Nations will be successfully concluded  as is so ardently desired by the international community and by the Cambodian people  who have suffered long enough. Turning now to the situation in the Middle East and Palestine  my delegation observes that the process which began last year in Madrid has continued towards a lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli crisis. The results of the Washington meetings  however  have fallen short of expectations. While we believe that a certain dynamism emerged  this will lead to success only if the relevant United Nations resolutions are taken into account in good faith thus showing a clear determination to restore peace and security in that part of the world. Even if the end of the confrontation between the two blocs has led to certain bright spots in Africa  with the logic of peace at work in Angola and Mozambique  even if democratization has made considerable progress  peace and harmony are not yet at home in many parts of the continent. For example  in South Africa  notwithstanding the positive initiatives of the minority Government  we must continue to condemn manoeuvres aimed at setting some peoples against others in an attempt to justify a system that belongs to another age. The international community must bring sustained pressure to bear to ensure that the vestiges of primitive racism will yield to a democratic  multiracial and egalitarian South African society. My country also deplores the break-up of the Somalian nation as a result of the appetites of certain warlords there. It is high time that we put an end to this abominable carnage whose victims are always the same: women and children. We strongly support the current initiatives of the Organization of African Unity  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the United Nations  and we urge the heads of the Somali factions to sit down at the negotiating table and try to put an end to the terrible tragedy of the Somali people. Liberia symbolizes the freedom of the black man. For the past two years it has been bogged down in a war that has taken a heavy toll in human lives and economic infrastructure. We appeal to the sense of responsibility of the primary leaders of that country and urge them to heed the voice of reason. Civil war in the last decade of the twentieth century is a major challenge to the constantly expressed desire for peace and security. In the recent past Chad has experienced internal crises  so we are hardly in a position to preach to anyone. But we still believe that a sincere commitment to disarmament or rigorous control of the transfer of conventional weapons  which are flooding zones of tension or open conflict  is an absolute necessity. My delegation welcomes the opening of the Register on Conventional Arms established by the Secretary-General. However  we have no illusions as long as there are secret sales of weapons  which are a source of income for certain suppliers and a means of acquiring power for the many beneficiaries. If today  with a degree of optimism  everybody could agree there is a real desire for change and progress in the world with regard to democracy and human rights  the economic situation in many developing countries of Africa  Latin America and Asia remains particularly disturbing notwithstanding some progress that has been made. The cold statistics of the United Nations Development Programme  the World Bank and the United Nations give us food for thought. The economic situation of the developing countries requires urgent solutions. As was stressed by the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development  ""The economic crisis that results from weakening investments and the slow growth of democratic institutions has threatened the national stability of these countries and their political future. Zones of poverty  which far from beginning absorbed are only spreading  are potential sources of violence and confrontation. The proof has already been given that these areas could flare up in ethnic  tribal or national conflicts. Therefore lasting development is an essential factor in the establishment of world peace and stability  which is undeniably in the mutual interest of all the members of the international community  whether developed or developing."" My delegation supports that analysis  and we urge the international community to implement without delay the various instruments that have been adopted thus far  in particular the Declaration on International Economic Co-operation  more specifically the growth the development of the developing countries. If there is one question that is of concern to all the members of the international community  it is the challenge of the environment. My country is located in a Sahelian area and daily witnesses the deterioration of its environment  so we attach special importance to this question at both the national and regional levels. However  the universality of the question means that it can be tackled only within the framework of international co-operation based on interdependence and solidarity. While we welcomed the Rio Conference on the Environment and Development  we still believe that its results will not put an end to the many and varied threats to the environment if real substance is not given to the concept of sustainable development. Over the past few years human rights have played a preponderant role in the lives of nations. New concepts that are still vaguely defined have emerged. However  political pluralism alone will not solve all the problems of more than half of mankind. That is why we hope that at the 1993 Conference all questions concerning human rights will be tackled. The United Nations is revived and refreshed as a result of the end of the era of confrontation between the super-Powers. The Organization has recorded astounding successes in such varied fields as decolonization and the maintenance of international peace and security thanks to the Blue Helmets who are scattered around the world  notwithstanding the difficulties that have been encountered in implementing the ideals of the Charter. One such ideal is the need for solidarity among peoples  and that solidarity can be realized only if we take into account the elementary needs of those who are destitute. On the threshold of the twenty-first century  men must show that  having avoided a nuclear holocaust  they are now capable of building a universal peace through development."
"152",6742,"TGO",47,1992,"The euphoria and enthusiasm that greeted  no so long ago  the disappearance of ideological East-West confrontation and the progressive expansion of freedom and democracy are today giving way to general discouragement because of the obstacles to the natural aspirations of peoples to freedom and legitimate well-being. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly has begun at a particularly difficult time in the history of humankind  which means that Mr. Ganev has assumed the presidency of the Assembly in a context of disquiet  but also one that is hopeful  because in all likelihood only our Organization can help the world to meet these challenges. On behalf of the delegation of Togo  we wish to convey to Mr. Ganev heartfelt congratulations on his election to the presidency of this session. The selection of Mr. Ganev  who possesses such great intellectual qualities and experience  is for his country the true embodiment of the ideals of peace and justice that it constantly advocates. We will be available at all times to work with him to ensure the success of his daunting mission. The delegation of Togo wishes to pay well-deserved tribute to his predecessor  Mr. Shihabi  for his outstanding performance in conducting the work of the forty-sixth session. His dynamism  his high standards of excellence and his zeal for punctuality compelled our admiration and accounted for the great success of our deliberations. I reiterate our sincere congratulations to him. We take this occasion to salute the Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for the dynamic work that he has undertaken since his election to the head of our Organization. The serious-mindedness and pragmatism he has demonstrated since taking office in January of this year lead us to believe that the United Nations will be able to make an even greater contribution to the maintenance of peace throughout the world and the promotion of solidarity among nations. In recent months  the family of the United Nations has grown with the addition of new Members. We wish to bid them welcome and to say how proud and happy the international community is to welcome them to our midst  with the hope that in keeping with the statements they made upon admission to membership they will espouse the San Francisco Charter in its entirety and will comply with its fundamental principles. Since the end of the last session  many events have marked the world. Efforts have been stepped up to build a new world order which must before all else be liberal  because it is based on the absolute need to respect human rights  which is a fundamental requirement for the establishment of relations of trust  peace and solidarity among peoples of our planet. The turmoil we have witnessed throughout the world  particularly in Europe  Asia and Africa in recent years  reflects the resolve of peoples to gain new freedom within which man can become the unchallenged artisan of his Government's destiny. Throughout the world  peoples are seeking freedom  peace and justice that only proper multipartite democracy can guarantee. Among these are the people of Togo  which for 13 years has been persevering in the effort to adapt the structures and the basic choices governing its socio-political context to meet the needs of our time and changing attitudes. Having broken with the previous regime and gained a constitution in 1979  our country resolutely committed itself to implementing measures of liberalization  detente and progressive democratization of our political life. These measures inter alia made it possible to hold free elections under the second and third legislatures and during municipal and prefectoral referenda of 1987  at the same time as they strengthened protection of human rights  particularly by setting up an independent commission.  The subsequent adoption of laws relating to the liberalization of the press  political pluralism and general amnesty  along with the development of a draft constitution to establish a multipartite regime  shows that already in the middle of 1991 the Government and the people of Togo truly desired to move on  without undue haste  to a higher stage in the process of democratizing our institutions. The tremendous speed of this movement that was started in the late 1980s culminated with the National Sovereign Conference of the living forces of the nation  which led to the transitional Government which was to lead Togo to elections and establish democracy. We must state that one year after the establishment of these transitional institutions the Government has faced enormous difficulties  and that tremendous efforts must be made before we attain our goals. The recent adjustment of the machinery of the institutions of this transition  proposed following the consultation meeting between the various protagonists of political life and endorsed by the Government and the legislature  the High Council of the Republic  overwhelmingly demonstrate the desire of the people of Togo to do everything possible to achieve peace and security  a State of law that they all sincerely want to see  by establishing new institutions through free and dependable democratic elections. The latest of these  the Presidential elections  are to end on 20 December of this year. This recent adaptation of the workings of this transitional Government meets the needs of our march forward  both by ensuring proper application of the constitution for this transitional period  so that no organ be unjustly deprived of its constitutional prerogatives  and by involving in the democratic process all national political leaders to rally consensus around the values underpinning our democratic renewal. These bodies have sufficient power to lead the country to this irreversible democratic peace process  but they do not have enough power to block our march to democracy. Accordingly we can only express satisfaction that the two senior officials of the executive branch  the President and the Prime Minister  have solemnly proclaimed their determination to continue to its end the democratic process that is under way and to devote all their energy to organizing referenda set by the electoral timetable. It is at this stage in our apprenticeship of democracy that the new Government of National Union of Transition  formed by the Prime Minister together with the Head of State and after consultations with the large political families  was approved on 14 September by a majority of 60 per cent by the High Council of the Republic and following a secret ballot. Very revealing indeed of the resolve of the people of Togo to overcome its contradictions in order to promote democratic renewal  this vote of approval  cast in a particularly difficult context  sufficiently demonstrates ""that in Togo  whatever might be said  we can still say no in full freedom and without any fear of a proposal from the executive power"". We take this opportunity to inform this Assembly that the draft constitution of the Fourth Republic  submitted to referendum on Sunday 27 September 1992  was adopted by 99.09 per cent. The referendum met with great enthusiasm and almost unanimous support  with a participation rate of nearly 75 per cent. The Government will not fail to learn the lesson from this first vote to correct the mistakes revealed in the first referendum. This is a guarantee for the acceptance of ballot results by all parties. It is appropriate to reiterate to our friendly countries and to the United Nations  as well as to the entire international community  the profound  gratitude of the Government and the people of Togo for the invaluable support they have given to our democratic process. We sincerely hope that this assistance will be continued throughout the coming elections. It is undeniable that the struggle to establish a State of law in Togo is a job that falls essentially to the people of Togo themselves  and that they bear the primary responsibility for fashioning their democracy  according to the means they have and in keeping with their culture and their national spirit. With courage and determination  we will strive to meet the challenge in union and mutual acceptance. In keeping with the conclusions of the work of the joint commission  the Government has set up a security plan the results of which can already be seen in the field.  Thanks to this consensus  political violence  which until recently was rampant in my country  is now being stemmed throughout Togo. All political parties will have access  without restriction and with complete security  to all parts of Togo during their political campaigns. Management by consensus in this short period of our political life is without any doubt the driving force behind political detente in Togo and a guarantee of the reliability and transparency of the coming elections. Finally  the major protagonists of our political life have agreed to the principle of mutual guarantees  whose importance is clear to all. We must implement all the measures that we have decided on before  during and after the elections. Our country  determined to restore peace and tranquillity  assures the Assembly that the democratic process under way is irreversible. Despite our hope that we can live from now on in an international society without conflict  the world continues to witness a growth of armed conflict. It is no longer merely Africa and Asia that contain pockets of tension. Europe  with war raging in the former Yugoslavia more precisely  in Bosnia and Herzegovina is now affected. That tragedy challenges the international community to do all it can to ensure respect for man and human dignity. We unreservedly support all the European initiatives and salute the laudable efforts of the United Nations to restore peace to that part of Europe. Elsewhere in the world  in Africa for some years now Somalia and Liberia have been two more hotbeds of tension where fratricidal war rages  already claiming thousands of victims. Death  desolation  poverty and hunger are the daily lot of these peoples. From this United Nations rostrum we call upon our Somali and Liberian brothers to demonstrate positive nationalism and constructive patriotism to help implement the relevant resolutions of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to contribute to restoring peace to their respective countries. The South African Government must understand that the wheels of history are still turning and that it is now clear that structures imposed by force cannot survive the determination of the people to live in peace. The continued plight of that part of our continent demands that the General Assembly intensify its efforts for victory in the fight to eradicate apartheid. This requires that all forms of pressure be maintained to compel the De Klerk Government to commit itself fully to the political and institutional reforms that it has already courageously undertaken. Togo is following with particular interest the developing situation in the Middle East. It reiterates its full support for the peace process started in October 1991 in Madrid  and calls upon the parties to demonstrate greater wisdom  courage and restraint in order to strengthen that process and bring about a final solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It should be based on a negotiated agreement acceptable to all  guaranteeing the security of all the States of the region  including Israel  within secure  internationally recognized borders  and allowing the Palestinian people freely and fully to exercise their right to self-determination. With regard to the Arab-Persian Gulf  where peace still seems to be threatened  my country reiterates its appeal to all the States of the region scrupulously to abide by the various relevant resolutions of the Security Council  and to make every effort to avoid the risk of new confrontations which still hovers over that part of the world.In Asia  Togo appreciates the Secretary-General's efforts to deploy the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). We hope that the national reconciliation effort now going on will gain further ground. Because of the great suffering they inflict on peoples  the conflicts to which I have referred render sterile any notion of sovereignty and independence. Is it not better  then  to prevent armed conflicts rather than seek to resolve them? Efforts made throughout the world by regional and international organizations in the search for new machinery to prevent war and maintain peace are likely to promote social progress and to establish better living conditions for our peoples. Accordingly  my delegation welcomes the fact that the Security Council on 31 January 1992 held a Summit meeting which considered ways of strengthening and making more efficient the United Nations capacity for preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping. Togo very much appreciates the conclusions of that meeting and the report (A/47/277) submitted by the Secretary-General at the Council's request. In dealing with the many conflicts raging throughout the world  preventive diplomacy would allow  with real determination by the protagonists of international life  particularly the parties to a conflict  the speedy attainment of its goal of peace. The world is now witnessing the end of East-West antagonism  but the much feared danger of a world war has not yet been overcome. Arsenals of highly sophisticated weapons still exist throughout the world  posing serious threats to international peace and security. There is an urgent need to destroy weapons of mass destruction and halt the arms race; the military Powers should devote themselves to that task in order to curb any reflex action to have recourse to war. The Non-Proliferation Treaty has been renewed without time-limit and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) have entered into force. The final text of the convention banning chemical weapons will be submitted for our consideration this session. All these developments increase the international community's hope that the military Powers will embark on general and complete disarmament. Furthermore  with the end of the cold war  and with distrust now giving way to trust and cooperation  the delegation of Togo believes that it is time for the international community to envisage drafting  without delay  a comprehensive test-ban treaty  after which the United Nations would play a leading role as the main body where consensus can be forged on security and disarmament problems. We welcome the recent initiative of President Francois Mitterrand in unilaterally decreeing a one-year moratorium on nuclear tests by his country.  We also welcome the statement made on 2 July 1992 by President George Bush on repatriating certain tactical nuclear weapons of the United States with a view to destroying them. As we see it  recent events and initiatives  as well as many positive world developments in the disarmament field  are encouraging. However  the proliferation and international transfer of conventional weapons  particularly in Africa  are a source of major concern on the part of the authorities of Togo. In this respect  we believe that a United Nations regional centre for peace and disarmament  like the one in Lome  is still useful and we should seek to increase its role  its powers and the scope of its activities. The United Nations should give the regional centres greater means so that they could fully participate in the strengthening of security and peace. Serious problems such as the ones connected with the maintenance of international peace and security persist  and this absolutely dictates the exploration of new approaches that could lead to a strengthening of the ability of the United Nations to act. While the East-West confrontation paralysed the Organization as it tried to carry out its noble mission  the current detente seems to offer greater opportunities now to Member States to reaffirm their commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter. For its part our country reiterates its faith in the United Nations and adheres to the mechanisms for establishing preventive diplomacy and restoring and maintaining peace. However  the efficient functioning of the United Nations presupposes restructuring its organs and adapting them to contemporary facts. The promotion of democracy and human rights means today that the fate of mankind as a whole in the special and delicate field of the maintenance of international peace and security should not be left to the discretion of only  a few States. The management of peace and security requires the concerted action of States as a whole  whatever their geographical size or their economic  financial or military power. Consequently  Togo unreservedly supports any proposal to revise the composition of the Security Council. If that were done  the democratic revolution going on in States will finally have reached international organizations. Peace and democracy presuppose the existence of a viable economy capable of meeting the vital needs of food  health  training and housing. The progress that needs to be made for man's full development is essential for democracy and its consolidation. It is a basic truth that there can be no development without democracy  just as one cannot conceive of democracy without development or peace. In order to safeguard peace in the world we must commit ourselves fully to the idea of a fairer division of the riches of the Earth. But we must note  with regret  that the international situation has not changed in this respect. At the end of this century an analysis of the international economic situation points up many social inequalities between nations. The hopes we had at the end of the cold war should find their justification in a partnership between rich countries and developing countries so that the appetites of some do not cause starvation in others. Unfortunately  we look on  powerless  as the gap between rich and poor grows ever wider. The economies of the developing countries are in a state of chronic recession  the most serious in several decades. Growth has slowed  particularly in Africa  where the crisis has fundamentally affected all aspects of life  and a real deterioration of living conditions has resulted in these countries. It is clear that this situation will continue unless efforts are made to establish a new world economic order based on fairness and a more generous humanistic vision of international cooperation. In this respect  we very much appreciate the decision taken by Japan to make available to Africa an aid package of $700 million spread out over the next three years. This action  and other measures too  although encouraging are far from meeting the real concerns of the developing countries  in particular the least developed of them. Indeed  if these countries are to break out of the profound crisis  urgent and appropriate action must be taken by the international community to guarantee remunerative prices for commodities and to dismantle tariff barriers  which are obstacles to the exports of these countries. It is vital that the international community mobilize larger resources to relaunch investment and that it find a lasting solution to the debt problem. Appropriate mechanisms must be found to make it possible to reimburse and generate resources to ensure economic recovery. The economic crises of our countries have social consequences that particularly affect young people. Juvenile delinquency  illicit drug-trafficking  drug abuse and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are serious threats for mankind. Constant attention should be focused on them. Sustainable and lasting economic and social development is impossible unless there is a healthy environment. Fortunately  today the international community has mobilized to solve the problems caused by the deterioration of the Earth and of nature. We are living in a new era today. This new era should be based on freedom  understanding  and love of one's neighbour and of peace. Guaranteeing peace and security  working for freedom and democracy  ensuring world prosperity through free international trade  preserving a healthy environment and creating stable international relations based on dialogue and cooperation: all these  among others  are challenges that should be met by the United Nations in order to establish the new world order that we all sincerely wish to see. Therefore we must give of our very best to attain these goals. We hope that the twenty-first century will give us a world in which man  freed from the plight of poverty  oppression  tyranny and destitution  can use all his faculties and give free rein to his creativity in order to achieve his own full development and the social and economic development of the State as the guarantor of peace and security."
"153",6812,"TJK",47,1992,"As the first representative of the Independent Republic of Tajikistan  I wish to congratulate you. Sir  on your election to the presidency of the Assembly and to express my Government's confidence in your guidance of the deliberations of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session to a successful conclusion.  I should also like to convey the felicitations of my Government to Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  under whose able leadership we are confident the United Nations will stand up to the new challenges in the years to come. The breakup of the Soviet Union more than a year ago gave birth to new independent States  which are making their mark on the world map. Although some of these States obtained their independence fairly easily  most of them are experiencing a great deal of difficulty in forming new States. The formation of a new Tajikistan is currently at a difficult and sensitive stage  which could be cause for concern. Tajikistan  like some other former Soviet States  is in the midst of an economic crisis. Since the reasons for this crisis are quite obvious  I should like to point out several other factors that exacerbate the severity of our situation. First  as an agricultural country  we were recently devastated by heavy rains and floods  which ruined our crops. Our economic losses are estimated at more than 10 billion roubles. In this context  allow me  on behalf of the people and Government of Tajikistan  to extend our appreciation to the people and Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran  Pakistan  Turkey and the United States of America for their assistance. However  I must add that this relief assistance has fallen far short of our proportionately large needs. I therefore call upon all international humanitarian organizations to send emergency relief assistance and foodstuffs to Tajikistan as soon as possible. Secondly  our geographical location puts us at a disadvantage in terms of transportation and accessibility. As far as transportation is concerned  up until the past few weeks there was even a threat of a blockade of the Republic. Lastly  Tajikistan has been experiencing some political unrest during the course of the past year. Despite these problems  since its independence Tajikistan has been recognized by 115 countries; established diplomatic relations with 37 countries and opened the doors of the embassies of seven countries in our capital  Dushanbe; and has become a member of such great world organizations as the United Nations  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  and the Economic Cooperation Organization. I humbly submit that this is an ongoing process. At this point  I should like to outline the foreign policy of the Republic of Tajikistan. As members know  from the very first days of its independence Tajikistan chose democracy as a system for its new development; despite economic and social difficulties  and even the death of its own sons  it has remained and will remain firm in its choice. It is no secret that the tension in our country was caused mainly by the former Government's attempts to breach certain regulations concerning freedom of the media and human rights. But these attempts failed and we will not allow them to surface again. At present  there is no power in Tajikistan that can stop the movement of democracy  but we need the support of the world community to ensure that democracy prevails in our Republic. Unfortunately  owing to the sensitivity of the situation  we cannot disclose information concerning certain events in our country. We believe that such information  if known  could only intensify the problem. But we wish the world community to know that we have no objection to the kind of freedom of the media that conveys true facts from various points of view and within the framework of integrity and professional ethics. We have had no case in which a journalist has been refused entry into Tajikistan or in which we have interfered with his or her activities. Nevertheless  we are often unhappy with the activity of the media from some countries that distort the facts and actual events. For instance  for a year certain media sources have been claiming that Tajikistan is building a fundamental Islamic State. They support this claim by alleging that Tajikistan is going to adopt an Islamic ideology in the place of communism; that Tajikistan is the only Islamic republic of the former Soviet Union where a political Islamic party exists legally and has grown into a unique political force; and that Tajikistan's foreign policy extends preferential treatments to Islamic countries. I declare before the General Assembly that none of these allegations is accurate and that we reject them all. The communist system and the communist ideology failed  and their influence is insignificant now. To believe that the people of Tajikistan would wish to replace communism with an Islamic ideology would be a great mistake. On the basis of freedom of speech and assembly  peoples of different political persuasions including democratic  nationalist and Islamic groups are legally active  in unison  in today's Tajikistan. This is the first sign of the democratization process in Tajikistan. We call upon the international community to assist us in our process of democratization. A relapse into communist dictatorship is impossible in our country. The people of Tajikistan are against any totalitarian regime. There is no foundation in Tajikistan for establishing such a totalitarian government. However  we are extremely concerned that the critical state of our economy can lead our country off its chosen course. Therefore  I appeal to the representatives of the world community to evaluate the situation in Tajikistan and to support the new democracy. As I have already indicated  all political parties in Tajikistan function within the law. Any conclusion to the contrary would be ill-founded and unrealistic. On the question of friendly relations between Tajikistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic State of Afghanistan  I should say that for us these are not merely two neighbouring Muslim countries. Tajikistan  Iran  and Afghanistan recall for one another the historic memory of a single nation. All of us constitute a single cultural  ethnic and linguistic unit. We rejoice in our independence  which allows us to establish friendly and good-neighbourly relations with our brothers and sisters in Iran and Afghanistan. We are proud of our heritage  our history and our culture  and hope that the significance of these factors in our lives will never diminish. Once one has strayed from one's origins  one must seek a state of reunion. I also want to emphasize that the goal of our foreign policy is to create a democratic society that will live in peace with its neighbours. This is the ultimate objective we pursue in our internal and foreign policies. Our foreign policy is  in fact  designed to secure this noble goal. The underlying objective of our foreign policy is to create a positive environment for Tajikistan in the international community. In this process  we will endeavour to adopt the type of measures and policies that benefit the people of Tajikistan while at the same time not constituting a threat or disservice to the interests of other nations. We support the guidelines established and recognized by the world community with respect to the norms of international relations  which stand against violations of human rights  oppression and racism. We support the peaceful settlement of all regional and international conflicts. Tajikistan supports the development of large-scale relations with all members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). We fully recognize and respect the inviolability of existing borders between the members of the Commonwealth of Independence States. We protect the human and cultural rights of all people living in the territory of our Republic and wish and hope that the same conditions hold true for the Tajiks living in other States of the CIS. At the same time  we recognize that political borders in the Central Asian republics are not based on ethnic origin and that this reality demands the exercise of much responsibility on all sides. Tajikistan's foreign policy is based on peaceful coexistence  good-neighbourly relations and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs. Hence  we wish to establish political  economic and cultural relations with our contiguous and non-contiguous neighbouring countries  such as China  India  Afghanistan  Pakistan and Iran. Tajikistan is situated in a region where Islamic culture and spirituality are deeply rooted. We therefore establish relations with countries and Islamic organizations according to our spiritual and cultural requirements. Islam is a holy and divine religion and  in our view  certain Western media have created an inaccurate picture of it. For more than a century we lived under the Russian Tsars and later we lived under the Soviet Union. At this period of our history we are not making any judgement  positive or negative. What is past is past. Through our ties with Russia and Russian intellectuals  we learned and became familiar with European civilization. Today we are able to establish our own ties with Europe and come even closer to its civilization. We believe that the peoples of Western Europe will show us their support and assist the Tajik people in their noble struggle. We feel that our tremendous hydro-power  agriculture and mining industry offers great potential for cooperation with European countries. As a newly established democracy  Tajikistan greatly values friendly relations with all States in Europe  the Americas  Africa  the Near and Far East and South-East Asia on the basis of mutual respect. We invite the representatives of all countries in the world to visit Tajikistan and to witness our open-door policy for friendly relations and mutual cooperation. We wish to assure the world community that the leadership in Tajikistan is doing its utmost to stop gun-smuggling of all kinds on its southern borders and to prevent its recurrence. The Government has devised a scheme for conciliation and for the disarming of parties to the conflict. Conditions in our territory are gradually normalizing. In this context  progress has been  achieved; the conflict limited in any case to the central portion of one of the provinces has de-escalated and a cease-fire has been agreed upon and announced. Ninety per cent of our territory is in a peaceful state. This is not a temporary calm  but the beginning of continued peace and durable stability throughout Tajikistan. We want to assure the world that we have no intention of becoming one of the globe's hot spots. I invite representatives to visit Tajikistan  one of the oldest human  civilizations in the world  to begin a new era of friendship and cooperation.  Our goal is to become an economically developed country with friendly trade  relations with our neighbours and with other countries in the world community.  Tajikistan respects and fully observes the United Nation Charter and the rule of international law. We support the constructive programmes designed by  the United Nations for the settlement of conflicts and problems throughout the  world.We wish to state that Tajikistan has designated a Permanent Representative to the United Nations and that he has already begun to fulfil  his duties. We believe that this will contribute to a strengthening of our ties with the United Nations and the rest of the world. "
"154",6950,"TUN",47,1992,"At the outset  I wish to greet this Assembly and to convey to it our esteem as well as Tunisia's appreciation for the United Nations' tireless efforts to realize the aspirations of mankind for peace  security and prosperity. I should like to take this opportunity to repeat my warm congratulations to you  Mr. President  on your election to preside over this session. We know that your skills will contribute to the success of our work. I should also like to command the positive role played by your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  representative of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  whose activities have extended the Arab and Muslim to the international level under the leadership of King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. Your predecessor made a major contribution to the work of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. I wish also to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros Ghali  the new Secretary-General of our Organization and wish him every success in his mission. He has embarked on his work with his accustomed characteristic dynamism and determination  which augur well for our Organization's future. I welcome the new Member States recently admitted to the Organization. No doubt  they will make a valuable contribution to the work of the international community in the service of security  peace and justice. For a number of years now  the world has been undergoing radical changes whose effects are beginning to make themselves felt at the international level. Detente is starting to emerge within the community of nations  and to create a climate conducive to the advent of world peace and security and the attainment of the lofty objectives that inspired the establishment of the United Nations. The international community has welcomed the dawning of a new era based on peace  security and the upholding of human rights in the wake of the ending of the cold war with its ideological conflicts that were the source of tensions and disputes in all parts of the world. Those changes show that the international community has begun to regain its self-confidence and to put its faith in concerted international action in the knowledge that international problems can be resolved only through the strict application of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  which all Member States have undertaken to uphold.  Tunisia  in this new era continues to be devoted to the noble purposes and principles upon which the United Nations was founded  and  therefore  considers that the desired new world order must be forged  as of necessity  through a process of peaceful and lasting settling of conflicts and resolving disputes by dialogue and negotiation with a view to establishing peace and security in the world. Despite the encouraging developments in international relations  the world today still faces major challenges in all fields and at all levels. We  therefore  must show realism and determination in facing up to those challenges within the context of the just and equitable application of international legality. Consequently  it is the first duty of the international community to focus  without delay  on questions that threaten peace  on the basis of the norms of international law and the values enshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as on the methods of preventive diplomacy as set out by the Secretary-General in his ""Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). The cause of the Palestinian people is one of the most important of these questions. This people has for too long been the victim of injustice  and it is time for it to exercise  like all other peoples  its right to self-determination and the establishment of its own independent State on its territory  in conformity with international legality and international instruments. Proceeding from the stance of championing the rights of peoples and adhering to the tenets of international legality  Tunisia has supported the efforts of the United States of America  the Arab countries and the international community to hold a peace conference on the Middle East  just as it has supported every constructive effort aimed at settling this question on the basis of returning the occupied Arab territories  including Al Quds  and the exchange of land for peace pursuant to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)  338 (1973) and 425 (1978). Tunisia has followed with interest the bilateral negotiations between the parties concerned  particularly Israel and the Palestinian delegation acting on the instructions of the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has also participated in the multilateral negotiations on the Middle East. While reiterating its support for the peace process  Tunisia joins the international community in calling upon Israel to put an end to its policy of settlement which aims at changing the demographic and social structure of the occupied Arab territories  changing their Arab cultural identity and imposing a fait accompli  as it is this policy that poses a major obstacle to the achievement of peace in the region. Tunisia has welcomed the positive developments witnessed by the people of South Africa in the direction of constitutional reform and the search for a formula that may lead to the emergence of a new  democratic society based on equal opportunity and the elimination of disparities. However  the halting negotiations between the authorities in Pretoria and the African National Congress of South Africa and the escalation of violence are cause for grave concern. Tunisia again expresses the hope that the necessary conditions will be met for the resumption and continuation of negotiations and the establishment of a transitional Government to implement the desired political reforms with a view to establishing a just and egalitarian society and putting an end to all forms of racial discrimination and all types of violence. In this way  the people of South Africa will be able to exercise their legitimate rights. participate in bringing about the recovery of the African continent and contribute to the strengthening of peace in the world. In this respect  we wish to express our highest regard for the efforts of the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  as well as those of the Organization of African Unity under the chairmanship of President Abdou Diouf with a view to reopening dialogue and putting an end to the use of violence as a means of settling disputes. The developments that have taken place on the international scene have substantially contributed to the defining of the parameters of the new world order and highlighted the tendency to effectively implement the principles and achieve the goals of the United Nations Charter. This has given the Organization a prominent status in the international arena  imparted a great deal of effectiveness to its action and enabled it to move rapidly and effectively  whenever possible  to put out the fires of discord  settle conflicts and restore lasting peace. Proceeding from this  Tunisia considers that the new world order cannot emerge and gain strength without the elimination of all sources of tension in the world. Tunisia  while welcoming the start made in putting into effect principles that it has long upheld  notes with deep concern the emergence of new sources of tension in the world  particularly in the Arab Maghreb region  in Somalia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina  as well as the exacerbation of the dispute between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United Arab Emirates over the islands of Abu Musa  the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb. As far as the Arab Maghreb region is concerned  the Arab Maghreb Union is entering its fourth year. In that short period  it has taken significant steps towards the establishment of its structures within the framework of rotation of its chairmanship between its member States. Nevertheless  certain difficulties exist and stand in the way of the Union. We are trying to overcome those difficulties and to find appropriate solutions to them. Among the difficulties is the crisis between Libya and certain Western countries. We hope a peaceful solution will be found for this dispute within the framework of international legality  particularly since Libya has accepted Security Council resolution 731 (1992). We hope that dialogue will be pursued with a view to finding a political solution that would be in the interest of the young Arab Maghreb Union and spare the region any escalation that may lead to instability. Tunisia also wishes to voice its profound concern over the situation in the sister country of Somalia due to the famine  the prevalent violence and the devastating war that threatens Somalia's very existence. Tunisia urges the parties to the conflict to put an end to the bloodshed and hopes that they will try and find an appropriate solution to the crisis  through a balanced approach of dialogue and negotiation. Despite its modest means  Tunisia has contributed to the humanitarian assistance extended to that sisterly country. In this respect  we wish to draw attention to the final document of the tenth summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on the subject of Somalia and urge the international community to work for its implementation in order to put an end to the martyrdom of the Somali people. While denouncing the deterioration of the situation and the continuation of acts of aggression  as well as the ""ethnic cleansing"" to which the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are being subjected  Tunisia considers that these inhuman acts perpetrated against the Bosnian people should inspire the international community to show more resolve and firmness in its actions so as to preserve the existence of that people and protect its rights. Tunisia supports the Security Council resolutions calling for measures to protect the population and halt this savage aggression against the Bosnian people  convinced as it is that such actions constitute a breach of the rights of peoples and a flagrant violation of the values and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The escalation of violence is also illustrated elsewhere by Iran's military occupation of the islands of Abu Mousa  the Greater Tunb and the Lesser Tunb  which belong to the United Arab Emirates. Proceeding from its adherence to the principles of the United Nations and tenets of international legality  which constitute an indivisible whole  Tunisia supports the United Arab Emirates' full and complete sovereignty over its territory  recalls the resolution adopted by the League of Arab States on this question  emphasizes the necessity of avoiding any act that would threaten the security of the Gulf region and calls for compliance with the principle of good-neighbourliness  for acting in accordance with international treaties and other instruments  and for resorting to the bodies that are competent to settle disputes of this kind. In the same vein  we wish to reiterate our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kuwait  in accordance with international legality and also wish to voice our concern over the destiny of the fraternal Iraqi people  as well as for the territorial integrity of Iraq  which must be preserved. In this connection  we hope to see our brethren in the region in a position to treat the past as a closed issue  in consonance with the spirit of understanding and solidarity that has always inspired the Arab nation. The new international order will not be able to take shape unless an end is put to the arms race  which constitutes a constant threat to international detent-p. Tunisia  which  since the Paris Conference  has made clear its position with regard to chemical weapons  welcomes the progress made towards general and complete disarmament  particularly with respect to weapons of mass destruction  which consume vast sums of money and huge resources. We also welcome the current efforts to strengthen and consolidate the process. In this respect  the agreement on chemical weapons recently concluded in Geneva is a positive step towards disarmament and the strengthening of international peace and security. However  the implementation of that agreement must go hand in hand with the elimination of other types of weapons of mass destruction  particularly nuclear weapons  especially in such a sensitive region as the Middle East. We see the new international order as one of freedom  democracy  and human rights  which are noble and universal values that are consonant with the ideals of the United Nations  to which the Tunisia of the new era subscribes. On the basis of this conviction  Tunisia is working to make those values a reality within the framework of a democratic process  the underlying foundations of which are the upholding of the rule of law and the functioning of the State through institutions based on respect for individual and collective freedoms within a tolerant and open civil society where justice  freedom  and equality prevail for all citizens and human rights are protected and promoted. Tunisia is convinced that genuine democracy rejects anarchy  the pursuit of supremacy  and violence. Democracy is a civilizing value based on a sense of responsibility and self-denial within the framework of recognized moral and social principles. Nevertheless  the success of this process also depends on recognition  in the case of every country of that country's specific features  as well as its characteristic socio-economic and cultural conditions  which are the foundations of their identity. Tunisia takes pride that it will host  next autumn  the conference organized by the United Nations on human rights in Africa as a prelude to the  International Conference on Human Rights. We also take pride in the fact that our country has been chosen by the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization to host the Conference on human rights and education to be held next November. Proceeding from the conviction that democracy and development are mutually complementary  Tunisia has given human rights their full meaning by extending them to the political  economic  social  cultural  and environmental spheres. In this respect  we see it as one of our first duties to improve the quality of life in a natural environment not threatened by desertification  pollution  or erosion. For this reason  Tunisia has decided to draw up an integrated national plan for the protection of the environment  and participated in the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992  where it put forward constructive proposals. Tunisia regards the protection of human rights as a daily duty that it develops and strengthens in the interest of its citizens in order to ensure for them a life of stability and dignity within a framework of sustainable development. The protection of human rights  in our view  means reconciling the interests of the individual and those of the community  for the interests of individuals would lose all meaning if society were threatened by anarchy and instability as a result of extremism and terrorism  especially when the perpetrators employ violence and exploit religion for unstated ends. The Tunisia of 7 November  being deeply attached to its Arab-Islamic identity  has always been one of the torchbearers of Islam and one of its largest bases. It therefore believes deeply in the message of openness  brotherhood  and coexistence preached by our Muslim religion and by the other revealed religions in general. Accordingly  concerned to prevent religion from being turned from its true path and to protect human rights and civil society from the actions of those who exploit religion in order to attain their unstated objectives  Tunisia has decided to set extremism and terrorism in their true context  and has done so in many regional bodies. Tunisia believes that it is time to adopt a collective position regarding this phenomenon and to cooperate sincerely in order to isolate extremist and terrorist groups which hide behind religion  in order for us to protect the interests of our peoples and our States and create conditions that make it possible to address the real problems  face up to the challenges and protect religion from any attempt to exploit and manipulate it. It is common knowledge that many countries continue to suffer from a difficult international economic situation that impedes their progress and development. These countries await with impatience the fruits of the new world order in the hope that this new era will be one not only of peace and stability  but also of development and economic and social prosperity. Although peace-keeping is the main concern of the new world order  the fact remains that its viability will depend on its ability to assign to economic and social issues their full measure of importance and to establish just and equitable rules for international cooperation. For this reason  we believe that the international community is today called upon to realize the aspirations of .our peoples regarding cooperation  solidarity  and the settlement of their basic problems. Thus  the new international order has a duty to reconsider the structure of the world economy with an eye to the general interest  without discrimination or exclusion. Given the exacerbation of the world economic crisis and its adverse effects on the process of development in the countries of the Third World despite the major efforts and immense sacrifices made by our peoples  it is essential that we put our heads together and try to find the best means of facing up to the economic problems of the world in an appropriate manner. The aim should be to enable our peoples to fully enjoy their economic  social and cultural rights and to make it possible for them to contribute to the democratization of our societies and the development of relations of understanding and friendship between peoples. Moreover  we hope the wealthy countries will be convinced of the need to expand their cooperation and to change the way they deal with us economically. This would encourage us and show appreciation for our efforts and sacrifices in the drive to restructure our economies. What we are asking the developed nations to do is to renounce their protectionist policies against our exports  and to seek a solution to the debt problems. While endorsing the Secretary-General's ideas in his ""Agenda for Peace"" wherein he calls for regional arrangements to contain crises in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations  Tunisia will continue to contribute with all the means at its disposal to the strengthening of this process. It will do so in particular in the bodies of which it is a member  namely  the Organization of African Unity  the League of Arab States  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement. We also hope that international economic issues will be accorded a larger share in the process of restructuring the United Nations  because of their effects on the future of peace in the world. Tunisia is convinced that the United Nations has a decisive role to play in the process of development in the Third World  and hopes that the Organization will continue to play that role in order to help those countries  which still sorely need the support of the Organization  and its specialized agencies in finding appropriate solutions to the problems of indebtedness  deteriorating commodity prices  deteriorating terms of trade  drying up capital inflows to middle-income countries and the transfer of the wealth of developing countries to the rich creditor nations. In this connection  Tunisia calls for a strengthening of trade in accordance with the international trade order which has emerged from the multipartite trade negotiations at the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  as this would be the ideal framework for strengthening the efficacy of international trade. Tunisia also calls for more participation by the developing countries in the decision-making process relating to international trade. Social questions today have assumed a higher position in the Organization's scale of priorities  particularly the issues of employment  health  education and the environment  which play a highly significant role in eliminating the causes of tension and in improving the quality of life for all-While welcoming the high priority accorded to such issues  Tunisia calls for promoting the tendency further and for the allocation of more adequate financial resources that would make it possible to meet the needs of the peoples of the Third World and to enable them to exercise their natural rights to employment  education and health. Proceeding from this  Tunisia supports the proposal for convening a world summit meeting on development in 1995 on the occasion of the Organization's fiftieth anniversary  following the international Conference on Human Rights scheduled for next year  the Conference on Population and Development that would be held in 1994 and the Women's Conference in 1995. The eyes of the peoples of the entire world are today turned towards the United Nations  which is the living conscience of mankind and the beacon of its hope for a better future. Therefore  Tunisia has renewed its longstanding attachment to the Charter and the goals of the Organization. It has always supported the Organization's efforts and is determined to support its action to ensure that law  justice and peace will have the upper hand in the world. The best proof of the stance is  of course  my country's continued participation in the peace-keeping operations organized by the United Nations  in the Congo and Namibia  in the sixties and  recently  in Western Sahara  Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia. We are convinced that the establishment and maintenance of peace depend on the intensification of peace-keeping operations whenever the need arises. In this connection  it may be necessary to conduct an in-depth study of the best means of tightening and supporting those operations while increasing the Organization's ability to continue to stage them successfully. The ideas and proposals that were thrashed out in the summit meeting of the Security Council last January have highlighted the need to develop and maintain a balanced relationship between the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Organization's Secretary-General  as well as for a strengthening of the role of the General Assembly  in the light of the important functions assigned to the Assembly under the Charter and in conformity with the new realities that have been created by the current developments in the international situation. The Security Council's role should be developed in consonance with those developments. We consider that it is high time we considered collectively the representation of the international community in the Security Council in the light of the great responsibilities assigned to it in maintaining international peace and security. In so doing  we shall have strengthened the democratic character of the organs of the United Nations in conformity with the new spirit of democracy now prevailing in the world. This will satisfy the yearnings of many peoples and will ensure for our Organization greater confidence and credibility in the eyes of international public opinion. We are fully convinced that our Organization  by virtue of its great experience and influence  is capable of giving effect to this ambitious civilizing project and making a valuable contribution to the strengthening of cooperation among Member States within the framework of a new outlook that will open up promising vistas for mankind and give it renewed hope and confidence. Tunisia has already put forward many ideas and proposals to bring about these new reforms and tendencies that  in our view  must shape international economic relations. On more than one occasion it has made appeals to this end  most significantly in the General Assembly at its forty-fourth session by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from this very rostrum  for the conclusion of a covenant of peace and progress between the industrialized and the developing countries. The constructive spirit prevailing in the work of this session once again confirms the determination of the United Nations to play to the full its assigned role in the international arena in the maintenance of peace and security in the world. We are convinced that the Organization will succeed in consolidating the achievements of mankind and in providing it with the opportunities it needs for progress and prosperity."
"155",6997,"TUR",47,1992,"It gives me great pleasure  Sir  to congratulate you on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly. We are happy to have a distinguished leader from a neighbouring country at the helm of the Assembly for the next 12 months. Our relations with Bulgaria are excellent  and we are very glad to have supported your candidacy. The forty-sixth session of the General Assembly was remarkable and eventful in a number of ways. Ambassador Samir Shihabi  the President at the last session  deserves a special tribute for his distinctive contribution to the efforts to enhance the stature of this universal forum. The competence and wisdom he displayed in guiding our work have justified the confidence we placed in him. We are fortunate that  in the person of Mr. Boutros-Ghali  the United Nations has found the experience and wisdom to which it can entrust itself for guidance to success. My Government is confident that this distinguished statesman from Africa  who is the product of the ancient and glorious civilization of Egypt  will provide the right mix of continuity and change in the renewal and restructuring of this world body. We wish our new Secretary-General success  and pledge him our support.  My delegation welcomes and salutes the 13 new Members of our Organization. We take special pride in the fact that Turkey enjoys ties of kinship  language and culture with some of them. They will surely enrich and strengthen our global family. In the past few years we have witnessed one of the great turning-points of history. The cold war has come to an end. The international landscape  characterized for so long by ideological confrontation and nuclear stalemate  has undergone a fundamental change. The bitter East-West rivalries that dominated every aspect of international affairs are finally behind us. These momentous developments have made it possible to settle a number of conflicts which were a direct result of the cold war. From Africa to Asia to Latin America  people have been able to lay aside ideological disputes and get on with the business of reconciliation and peacemaking. The United Nations may rightly take pride for having played an important part in bringing together former ideological adversaries and brokering agreements. It has demonstrated how effective it can be by playing a leading role in the liberation of Kuwait  showing that it can function as its founders intended nearly half a century ago. We were at last able to look forward to a world liberated from the awful threat of nuclear destruction  with nations enjoying the fruits of commerce and industry in peace  security  freedom and democracy. However  it now appears that we were all perhaps carried too far by the new wave of optimism. From the Balkans and the Black Sea basin to the Transcaucasus  and from Afghanistan to Somalia  there have emerged new conflicts pitting nations and ethnic communities against one another. Now peace and security are threatened by destruction and economic ruin  compounded by the horrors of ""ethnic cleansing"" and mass starvation. The most severe challenge to the new order has been posed by the series of crises engulfing the former Yugoslavia. The international reaction to the sinister designs of the former Yugoslav army in Croatia last year was not forceful enough to deter the aggressors at that time. Today the bitter consequences of our inadequate response are being harvested throughout the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina  whose sovereignty and territorial integrity have been violated in defiance of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. While the international community has condemned Serbian aggression and the abhorrent practice of ""ethnic cleansing"" and demanded an immediate end to all violations of international humanitarian law  the suffering in Bosnia and Herzegovina goes on. People are still getting killed. Mandatory resolutions of the Security Council are yet to be fully implemented. Hundreds of thousands of Bosnian refugees face an uncertain future away from their homes. Those surviving in the ruins of once-flourishing cities and towns are threatened by starvation and disease. As winter approaches  the need to provide security and shelter to the population becomes ever more pressing. I have myself had a chance to glimpse the suffering in Sarajevo. In addition to our international responsibility and obligations as a member of the world community  the historical and cultural bonds which my country shares with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the presence in Turkey of a large number of citizens of Bosnian descent place us in a special relationship to the fate of this country. At a time when Bosnia and Herzegovina are being carved up by the aggressors  priority has been given to the provision of humanitarian assistance. Therefore  while supporting other efforts to reach a peaceful  settlement  we have also put forward an action plan that consists of a set of concrete and effective measures designed to stop the fighting in that country. We fear that further continuation of the Bosnian conflict could lead to greater dangers. We remain prepared to assist any concerted international action to bring about an end to the Bosnian tragedy. On Iraq  we remain concerned two years after the Gulf crisis. Baghdad has yet to demonstrate that it truly wishes to take its rightful place in the international community. The Iraqi Government should comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions. My Government will be the first to welcome a return to normality and the restoration of normal relations between Iraq and its neighbours. From this rostrum Turkey has on many occasions expressed its consistent stand on the question of Palestine. Today  I wish to reaffirm our support for the negotiating process on the Middle East conflict launched in Madrid in October 1991. This is a very important opportunity for peace  and we call on all the parties to seize it to arrive at a comprehensive and lasting settlement on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). As a neighbouring country  Turkey follows very closely the developments in the Caucasus. In this region  the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is a source of deep concern for us because of its implications for peace and security in the whole area. Turkey holds the view that in this region there can be no place for adventurism and reckless behaviour. Armenia should disengage from Nagorno-Karabakh and withdraw its forces from Azerbaijani territories. We urge the parties to achieve a negotiated political solution on the basis of respect for the inviolability of international borders  for minority rights and for the principles of the United Nations Charter and relevant Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) obligations and commitments. We shall continue to work for peace in this region. In the same spirit  we look forward to further progress in establishing democracy and restoring peaceful conditions in our neighbour and friend  Georgia. In Afghanistan  we had hoped that all would put aside their differences and start the process of reconciliation. However  we have been greatly dismayed by the recent eruption of fighting in Kabul. Turkey calls on all sides in Afghanistan to put an end to this fratricide and to start working for peace  so that the reconstruction and rehabilitation of this devastated country may begin and millions of Afghan refugees may finally return to their homes. In South Africa  we fully support the democratization process  which should lead to a complete dismantling of apartheid and to the creation of a new non-racial society in that country  based on due respect for the human rights of all South Africans. The search for a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question continues. The proximity talks which started on 18 June within the framework of the Secretary-General's good offices mission have registered some progress and resulted in the beginning of face-to-face talks between the leaders of the two communities. This positive turn in the negotiating process has been achieved in great part owing to the constructive contribution of President Denktas. However  much remains to be done before we can reach our objective. It is our sincere hope that prior to the resumption of the direct talks on 26 October between the leaders of the two communities  sufficient ground will be covered so that an early completion of the work on the set of ideas will be possible. Once that stage is reached  Turkey stands ready to participate in the four-party conference to conclude an overall framework agreement. We are gratified to note that in our day democratic pluralism  the rule of law  free and fair elections and respect for human rights have finally become the universally accepted attributes of a modern State. The best guarantee of respect for human rights is the existence of a democratic form of government. In other words  democracy and human rights are inseparable. We welcome the progress of democracy in all regions of the world. We expect the United Nations to play a more active role in the strengthening of democratic institutions. We regard the ever-growing number of requests being received at the United Nations to assist in the holding of elections as a very encouraging development. In the field of human rights  no country can claim to have attained perfection. All countries experience violations of human rights  and all must  whatever their records may be  strive to improve their performance in this area. In Turkey our human-rights legislation and practices are kept under constant review in order to eliminate abuses and rectify shortcomings. As a party to all of the European instruments and control mechanisms aimed at protecting human rights  as well as to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  our objective is to guarantee everyone the fullest enjoyment of human rights and to prevent any violations or malpractices. We have made important strides in Turkey  and we are resolved to maintain this course. On a broader plane  we are concerned with the growing incidence of xenophobia and new forms of racism that increasingly threaten the very existence of migrant communities in Europe. Turkey is directly affected by this negation of human values  since there are more than 2 million Turkish citizens living in European countries  either as migrant workers or as their dependents. Like all individuals  these people too are entitled to enjoy security of person and protection by the State against random violence  threats or intimidation. We urge the host countries to ensure the protection of these individuals  to see to it that their human rights are duly respected  and effectively to prevent and punish violence and racist crimes against them. All manifestations of xenophobia and discrimination must be curbed if tolerance and mutual understanding are to put down deep and lasting roots. Non-governmental organizations should spend more time and energy in monitoring violations of the human rights of migrant communities. My delegation would like to draw the attention of the General Assembly to the widespread phenomenon of subversive violence carried out by terrorist groups. Such violence constitutes a most serious infringement of human rights and fundamental freedoms  including the basic right to life. It aims at nothing less than the destruction of democracy. This is a crucial fact which we must never forget. We think the time has come for the relevant United Nations bodies  the Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights  and the non-governmental organizations to address this question of terrorist violence as a matter of priority. Having experienced rapid social change and urbanization  Turkey today seeks to improve the quality of life of its population  to ensure equal advancement opportunities for all and to promote both individual initiative and community solidarity. We are focusing on protecting vulnerable groups so that they can play a productive role in society. In other words  Turkey strives to achieve economic growth with a human and social dimension. My Government believes that social problems affecting the international community will be increasingly difficult and costly to overcome if concerted action is not taken promptly. Turkey attaches great importance to international efforts directed at easing social problems and tensions and supports the convening of a world summit for social development. The Government of Chile should be commended for its imaginative initiative in this direction. I should now like to turn to international economic issues. The political developments in Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union  the aftermath of the Gulf crisis and the protracted recession in the industrialized countries have had negative effects on the world economy. The World Economic Survey reports that for the first time since the First World War the global economy has lot grown. The events of the past year have continued to obstruct and render fruitless the efforts of the developing countries to restructure their economies. With the economic policies of all countries converging as never before  the time has come to launch a concerted effort to create an international economic environment more congenial to growth and sustained development. Countries with economies in transition are continuing their efforts to ensure integration into the world economy. The major difficulties of the developing countries are well known. We regret that the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations has not yet been concluded. This raises fears of protectionism. Since trade is a major vehicle for developing countries to break free of the burden of foreign debt and pursue their development efforts  the necessary political will must be displayed for these negotiations to be concluded successfully. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was a major step towards broadening the scope of economic development in a sustainable manner. The Conference accelerated the universal push towards global sustainable development. Turkey believes that this momentum is now irreversible. We must look beyond the Conference and devise policies that would help to perpetuate and strengthen this momentum. Turkey holds the view that a good way to work towards the objectives of peace  political and social stability as well as economic development is through regional cooperation. The political changes of the past few years have broadened the opportunities for such cooperation. In full awareness of this promising trend  Turkey has taken the initiative of launching a comprehensive scheme for expanded cooperation between the countries of the Black Sea region. The aim of this regional cooperation is to ensure that the Black Sea becomes an area of peace  stability and prosperity in which regional cooperation can be used as a tool to accelerate the integration of the participating States into the global economy. At the high-level segment of the Economic and Social Council last July  there was a focused discussion on restructuring the economic system of the United Nations. The economic and social structure of the United Nations needs to be developed in a way that will enable it better to respond to the growing challenges of our changing world. With the addition of new Members  the question of the distribution of seats in United Nations bodies to geographical regions comes up for consideration. It would be desirable also to consider whether the current geographical groupings conform to our present-day needs. We know that the artificial division of Europe between East and West in the United Nations is the result of ideological differences which have ceased to exist. The question of merging the Group of Western European and Other States with the Eastern European Group should be given active consideration. The challenges before the United Nations are as great as ever. Despite the ending of the cold war  conflicts rage on in many parts of the world and threaten to proliferate. Economic problems persist  made worse by a recession which will not go away. The humanitarian problems confronting the international community have never been more daunting. There continue to be massive violations of human rights in many parts of the world  while the environment raises problems which we must solve if we are to survive on this planet. Great as these challenges are  we have in the United Nations a comprehensive framework within which we can operate and address mankind's problems. The end of ideological conflicts makes this possible. The restructuring carried out in the Secretariat under the leadership of our newly elected Secretary-General is a good beginning in strengthening our newly elected Secretary-General is a good beginning in strengthening our Organization. There is a new spirit in the Security Council and in the Economic and Social Council. The General Assembly has never been more representative. The report of the Secretary-General entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) provides  in a timely manner  the intellectual foundation for our future activities. The United Nations must not only set the tone and provide political guidance to regional organizations in their efforts to secure peace  but must also be prepared to assume its leadership role. It must not fail to live up to its responsibilities under the Charter. The conditions are right for the great challenges to be met successfully. For the United Nations to pass the test  everything depends on the Members who must act in concert and with courage. My delegation undertakes to work with other delegations in a spirit of cooperation and compromise so that our Organization may live up to its high promise and serve mankind at this crucial time. "
"156",7059,"TZA",47,1992," We have come here to renew our faith and confidence in the world Organization. In a way  especially to us in Africa  the United Nations has assumed a unique position. This is the first time since the founding of the United Nations in 1945 that the Organization has a Secretary-General from Africa. The Tanzanian delegation congratulates Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali on his well-deserved election. The United Nations has assumed great significance because this change in the leadership of the United Nations has come at a time when the changes in the international system during the last few years have imposed upon all countries the need to reassess familiar attitudes and policies.  I congratulate the President upon his taking office during this period of change. His wealth of experience  skill and commitment are not only a valuable asset to the forty-seventh session  but also speak volubly of the capabilities of his own country  Bulgaria  with which Tanzania enjoys excellent relations. I am confident that he will ably adorn the position  bringing to it prestige and impartiality. His predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  presided over the forty-sixth session with great skill. My delegation joins in the expressions of appreciation addressed to him. In any human history  there are certain historical conjunctures which distinguish one period from another. The five-year period between 1987 and 1992 will be regarded as an important period in world history. This phase coincided with the ending of the cold war and witnessed the expansion of the boundaries of the international system through the birth of 21 additional States in the period 1991-1992 alone. I am delighted to join the warm welcome extended to the newest Members of our Organization. The nature of governments has been transformed by increased democratization of their domestic political orders; the structures of power and influence in the world have been altered by the disintegration of the Soviet Union. These developments call for a transformation of the pattern of diplomatic interactions  especially in the United Nations  and the refashioning of the basic structure underlying the international system so that the emerging new order may be based on right rather than might  on justice rather than expediency. In retrospect  the political landscape of the international system has been profoundly and positively altered in the last five years. Yet it has  also opened up new instabilities  more challenges to international peace and security  greater uncertainties - especially for developing countries and more danger of armed conflicts  as reflected in the killings in Liberia  Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. These conflicts pose a grave danger to the very life of human civilization. The forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a critical juncture: we are between two worlds one dead  the other powerless to be born. We are overshadowed by the dangers of unipolarity  economic decadence in the developing countries  ecological dangers in the developed countries  and the persistence of old injustices in Palestine and South Africa. This diagnosis of the state of the world applies to the contemporary global configuration and to regional scenes alike. In the global setting  a -period of deep-seated  intense East-West conflict has ended with the conclusion of the cold war. As a result  an established order has given way to an as yet undefined future. At the regional level  there are equally mixed results. For example  in South Africa  not long ago  the progress made in the last two years in eradicating apartheid all of a sudden appeared to be on the brink of collapse as the apartheid regime not only retrenched  but also perpetuated township violence and refused to concede the major demands of the African National Congress  the Pan Africanist Congress and other democratic forces. Looking at the areas of conflict  it appears as if  all of a sudden  the conclusion of the cold war has given way to a kind of Hobbesian state of nature in which peoples and nations are caught in perpetual conflict and competition over land  resources  food  labour and markets.  In the last two years alone  Africa has witnessed several intra-State conflicts which have resulted in heavy human costs  in terms of casualties and dislocations; direct material costs  in terms of property damage; and opportunity costs. Neighbouring States have also paid heavily through their efforts to strengthen their security on common borders  through caring for refugees and through the diversion of their Governments' attention away from developmental efforts to crisis management related to wars  armed conflicts and insecurity. In short  these conflicts have thwarted African efforts towards economic recovery and peaceful transformation to a democratic order. Thus  while encouraging Africa to transform its political and economic systems  the developed nations have a moral and historical duty to assist the continent in pursuing a sustainable development strategy that is people-oriented. Such assistance will ensure that Africa pursues genuine development and rids itself of a major cause of internal conflicts. In the last year  Tanzania has been host and facilitator to mediation efforts in the conflict in Rwanda. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front have been able to achieve a cease-fire to set the stage for a lasting political solution. Tanzania would like to congratulate them upon this great achievement  and to pay tribute to the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity  to neighbouring States and to other countries for their contributions to these efforts. Angola and Mozambique have endured long periods of internal conflict. As we meet here today  Angola has successfully completed a crucial multi-party general election and Mozambique has recently signed a joint declaration with RENAMO. These developments will determine the peace and security interests of the two countries. Tanzania commends the Governments and peoples of Angola and Mozambique for having taken the path of reconciliation and accommodation. Unfortunately  the optimism expressed on Angola and Mozambique cannot be extended to the intractable problems of the Middle East. Since the Madrid Conference  several rounds of talks have been held. There have been at least two outstanding obstacles to successful negotiations: Israel's refusal to accept a Palestinian delegation composed of members of the Palestine Liberation Organization  and Jewish refusal to freeze settlements in occupied areas. There can be no successful mediation in which the Palestinians  as one of the parties  are continuously denied legitimacy. While Tanzania supports all international efforts to resolve the conflict in the Middle East  the mediation process must be based on the presumed equality of the parties to the conflict. Effective mediation must also proceed from a clear consent and valid representation of all the parties to the conflict. What has been said of regional conflicts can also be stated of the environment. As witnessed at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro  humanity now faces one of its most serious sources of insecurity  the ecological ill-health of the planet itself. Asymmetries in non-sustainable development and industrialization  economic development and resource politics are at the heart of the environmental debate. Tanzania  like most other developing nations  has four major concerns over the environment  namely: environmental space; environmental growth; environmental conditionally; and environmental democracy. To explain these concerns  we have to emphasize that the developed nations must reduce pressure on the environment through corrective action to enable developing countries  including Tanzania  to achieve environmental space for industrialization. Environmental growth  that is  the provisions of resources to raise living standards  is necessary to eradicate poverty. Environmental conditionality must  by and large  be eradicated. Without ignoring the relationship between technology and environmental degradation  the present conditionalities on the provision of foreign assistance is a diversion which tends to conceal real issues that hinder development efforts. The developing countries are responsible for only a small part of the pressures on the global environment. Environmental democracy refers to participation by the developing countries in the decision-making procedures in multilateral institutions involving finance for the environment. Another component of environmental democracy is to ensure that the question of economic development is not subsumed under environmental concerns. Thus  the task for the international community after the historic Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro will be to merge  wisely  environmental policies with socio-economic development. Tanzania looks to the establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development under Article 68 of the Charter. The period from 1987 to 1992 could be regarded as an extraordinary moment  one which has opened up opportunities to confront and surmount the old and new instabilities and challenges to peace and security. Typical of the period of transition in the international system  negotiations  as a peace-making and policy-making instrument  have assumed renewed significance in resolving old and new issues. Indeed  the debate in the United Nations during the last two sessions of the General Assembly has been dominated by one theme: the unprecedented opportunity created by the end of the cold war to create a new world order. There is no doubt that the end of super-Power rivalry has contributed significantly to the ending of a number of conflicts  including those in Afghanistan  Angola  Cambodia and Namibia. This historic opportunity has facilitated increased United Nations involvement in peace-keeping and peacemaking activities in many parts of the world. However  a new world Older must be based on the linkage between freedom and development  justice  peace  security and democracy within nations and among nations. From time immemorial  philosophers have reminded practitioners of the primacy of human freedom that is possible in society and through society only when structural inequalities and injustices have been eradicated. Any new world order ought to be based on the greatest good  and in the guarantee of equality and freedom for all. It must be based on the genuine maintenance of peace and security in the broader sense of preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-keeping and peace-fostering. For one can maintain security without necessarily maintaining peace  as the former may require measures that uphold the status quo  while the latter could require actions aimed at altering the existing situation. While security refers to the absence of direct violence  peace focuses on the absence of the structural violence of institutionalized injustice and inequalities. This approach is a sine qua non for development  democracy and justice  and for peace and security in general.  The conception of a new world order must begin with the reforms in the United Nations and emphasize the important role of regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement. The role of the United Nations must be reinterpreted to foster emancipation from underdevelopment  injustice  inequalities and political domination. It must spearhead both democracy and liberty in general  and the economic capacity to enjoy that liberty meaningfully. I reiterate that the United Nations  and especially the Security Council  must be reformed because it is based on an outmoded concept of international peace and security. The maintenance of peace and security cannot be exclusively focused on traditional peace-keeping or peacemaking  nor can it be left the exclusive domain of the Security Council. There is also an economic  social and moral obligation to the international community as a whole. The tragic conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Somalia indicate that the traditional United Nations peace-keeping methods have outlived their utility. Where the very survival of humanity is at stake  where the outbreaks and the level of violence reach enormous proportions  threatening the very fabric of human civilization  and where ethnic conflicts might necessitate external intervention and thus threaten international peace and security  the United Nations must be able to act promptly and decisively. Somalia is a typical example. My delegation calls upon all parties involved in the conflict to exercise restraint  to cooperate in facilitating the distribution of humanitarian assistance and to set up a government of national reconciliation. Tanzania applauds the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations  the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity  the Organization of the Islamic Conference  the Arab League and individual Governments in providing humanitarian assistance and in searching for a political solution in Somalia. In January this year the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to study and make recommendations on ways to strengthen and make more efficient the United Nations capacity for preventive diplomacy  peacemaking and peace-keeping in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Tanzania commends the Secretary-General on his prompt  comprehensive and thought-provoking response. Any durable international system must have a sound legal regime  including respect for and compliance with the rule of law at domestic and international levels and a democratic pattern of interaction. It is in this context that the General Assembly's declaration of the United Nations Decade of International Law  from 1990 to 1999  must be supported. This declaration is a clear indication of the concerted efforts of the United Nations in the legal field to advance the search for a new world order. The Secretary-General has underlined this very important point in his recommendation for a much more effective use of the International Court of Justice  including acceptance of the Court's compulsory jurisdiction. However  an effective global legal regime presupposes the existence of sound economic and political institutions: there is a mutually reinforcing relationship. The end of the cold war has tended to strengthen international concern over a systematic policy framework for human development  and has provided the opportunity for a greater range of sophisticated analyses and strategies on the question of development. As I have stated previously  a sound new world order based on human freedom is possible only in a reorganized global society where structural inequalities and injustices are systematically eradicated. Yet the Fourth United Nations Development Decade is beginning from an unpromising base. Global macroeconomic indicators for the last 18 months reveal a bleak picture. World per capita output remained unchanged in 1990  fell by 2 per cent in 1991 and is expected to fall again  by about 1 per cent  in 1992. Developing countries as a whole have for two consecutive years have undergone an unprecedented decline in their per capita incomes. As the Group of 77 has consistently pointed out  economic growth in the South has been countered by inequality in the global monetary  financial and trade systems and by dwindling resource flows  debt burdens  restrictions on the transfer of technology  denial of market access  adverse terms of trade and declines in the prices of the primary commodities that the South produces. Among the developing countries  the African region was the worst hit. Total African-region output increased by only 1.9 per cent in 1991  compared with 3.2 per cent in 1990  while the non-oil-exporting countries' average rate of growth of combined output! fell from 1.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent in 1991. Southern Africa has the added problem of the worst drought in recent memory  which threatens about 100 million people. The gloomy economic indicators coincide with the post-cold-war development of changes in the domestic policies of many developing countries  including Tanzania. Restructuring is designed to enhance the dynamism of national economies through the provision of economic enterprise and innovation and opening up to the operation of market forces. The soundness and efficacy of the policies aside  many of the domestic reforms also depend on a supportive external environment at regional and global levels on such  important issues as debt-servicing burdens  capital flows  market access and commodity prices. Several conclusions can be drawn from an analysis of the global economy  amongst which are  first  that economic divisions and rivalries inevitably produce political conflicts; and  secondly  that there is a lopsided global interdependence of growing inequalities within and between nations  which cannot be resolved through narrow conceptions of power politics. There can be no genuine democracy where development strategies do not centre on humankind. As the South Commission report aptly defines it  development ""... is a process which enables human beings to realize their potential  build self-confidence  and lead lives of dignity and fulfilment. It is a process which frees people from fear of want and exploitation  and is also a process of growth  a society that is developing development is people-centred efforts of the people  by and for the people"". This correct conception of development covers the essential variables of human development  such as putting people at the centre of any development  the correlation between human development and human freedom  advanced levels of economic activity  and equitable domestic and global distributions of income and opportunity. Indeed  questions such as how the disparities between the poor and the rich can be reduced or why global markets fail to meet the needs of the world's poorest focus on the restraining problem of human development. Tanzania has followed with great interest the efforts by the Secretary-General to restructure the United Nations. Tanzania believes that reform and restructuring of the United Nations  involving both the intergovernmental machinery and the Secretariat  should foster a more efficient and effective structure without marginalizing the interests of the Member States  and especially the developing countries. As I stated earlier  the United Nations alone cannot succeed unless it cooperates with regional organizations such as the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African Unity  which represent the aspirations of developing nations. The roles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African Unity are not unique to modern third-world or African conditions. The modern State system has historically been characterized by the struggle for human freedom and development. This resolve has emanated from two concurrent historical tendencies: on the one hand  great-Power hegemony and exploitation; and  on the other hand  the opposition of the overwhelming majority of the medium and small States to that exploitation. None of the present changes in the international system has undermined these central features of the 400-year-old State system. The number and identity of hegemonies may change over time  but the existence and nature of the struggle namely  the demand for the State system to function according to the universality principle and for equality and justice between States has not changed. The plight of developing nations underscores the significance of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of African Unity in the struggle to bring equality and justice for the affairs of humanity. Tanzania believes that these regional organizations provide the foundation for collective action in fostering South-South economic cooperation  enhancing the democratization of international relations  and renewing democratic debate and dialogue between nations  especially North-South multilateral negotiations  which are currently at a stalemate. The end of the cold war should enhance rather than confuse our resolve to build a new world order based on freedom  justice  equality and the development of humanity as a single family. This approach is the one we must take in the present period  when poor States and peoples are becoming poorer and the rich are becoming richer  and must be seen as the real meaning of democracy at national and global levels. Viewed from this perspective  it is intolerable that any section of the same human family should not enjoy basic economic  social  cultural  political and civil rights. The human family of nations must not only examine the underlying causes of conflicts  injustice and underdevelopment  it must also seek to change social relationships and transform social structures in such a way that a more just  equal and dignified world emerges. That new world order awaits us. That world order beckons to us. It is a world order we must strive to achieve. "
"157",7102,"UGA",47,1992,"Mr. President  allow me to congratulate you most warmly on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am confident that  given your skills and experience  you will successfully guide our deliberations. I wish also to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor. Ambassador Samir Shihabi of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  for the excellent manner in which he steered the work of the forty-sixth session. It is with a sense of pride and satisfaction that I take this opportunity  firstly  to congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  a distinguished son of Africa  on his deserved election to the important post of Secretary-General of our Organization; and  secondly  to express sincere appreciation to him for the commendable leadership he has showed in carrying out his duties. Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali's long and valuable service to Africa  especially within the Organization of African Unity (OAU)  the central role he played in peacemaking under the Camp David accord  and the considerable familiarity he has with the burning issues of the developing world give him impeccable credentials for this Organization's highest and most challenging post. We wish him every success; he enjoys Uganda's full confidence; and he can count on our constant cooperation and support.* Uganda welcomes the 13 new Members of the United Nations  with which we look forward to forging close and mutually beneficial relations. An important principle of this Organization is self-determination by the people of the Member States. The admission of new Members is in keeping with that principle. When we gathered here at the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly  it was against a backdrop of international political developments which had profoundly altered the global landscape. The transformation of international relations has  over the last year  increased in pace and ushered in a new pattern of relations. In place of the cold war between East and West  we now Mr. Kalpage (Sri Lanka)  Vice-President took the Chair.  see a more cooperative relationship. Mutual suspicion  conflict and the attendant arms race between the major Powers have been replaced by dialogue and joint endeavours. Dictatorships are giving way to democracies  and conflicts are being resolved through dialogue. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement  Uganda has always urged the major Powers to put an end to their rivalry and  instead  pool their efforts to promote international peace and security and also the economic and social development of all countries  as envisaged by the Charter. We therefore welcome the emerging peaceful relations among the major Powers  and we accordingly have a good basis for hoping that investment in economic and social development worldwide will now receive a higher priority. In this connection  special note must be taken of the important address to this session of the Assembly by President George Bush of the United States when he put forward new ideas about international economic cooperation. These ideas merit serious consideration. It will be recalled that the cold-war divisions hampered the efforts of the Organization in fulfilling its mandate. But now the correspondence of objectives among the permanent members of the Security Council  as contemplated by the founding fathers  has facilitated the United Nations central role in finding solutions to various regional crises. From Yugoslavia and Cambodia to Somalia  to name but a few  it has now become possible for the United Nations to handle the underlying causes of crises without its actions being hamstrung by the ideological differences between its Members. As the confidence being reposed in the United Nations has increased  so have the responsibilities the Organization is being called upon to undertake. Yet its resources remain precarious. There is an urgent need for the Organization to be strengthened  in order to be able to be appropriately restructured  and to be provided with adequate means meet the challenges before it. It is critical that the United Nations organs be made more representative so that they can cater more meaningfully to the interests and aspirations of all its Members. The objective should be to make the decision-making process in the United Nations  including the Security Council  more democratic and transparent. It is with this in mind that Uganda will positively examine the various proposals for reform of the United Nations. We are thus prepared to examine proposals for reform and expansion of the Security Council to reflect contemporary realities that will lead to a more equitable and balanced representation without  however  sacrificing capacity and efficiency. The present structure of the Security Council reflects the realities of 1945 and the resultant cold war. Countries were designated permanent members because of their capacity  at the time  to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security and to prevent war. For the record  it ought to be stated  with appreciation  that the Organization's structures have discharged their principal obligations well  and have  in particular  safeguarded the international community against a world war and against a nuclear catastrophe. It must  however  be acknowledged that we are now moving into an age where new issues such as development  environmental protection and technological advancement are critical in international relations and affect the security of the world. We therefore believe it is necessary to review the criteria for permanent membership in order to take into account the capacity of countries to contribute in this regard. If only for the sake of accountability  it is imperative that Member States  on which our Organization will increasingly depend as the main source of contributions for the implementation of its new agenda for the next century  should also have a say in the decision-making structures of the United Nations. Secondly  in any restructuring of the Council  it is also important that consideration be given to having for each major region a permanent member  which would be designated through consultation with the relevant regional groups or organizations. An important criterion to take into account is that a country  large or small  seeking membership on the Security Council must fully embrace  and be seen to act in accordance with  the underlying values of the United Nations mandate for peace  respect for human rights  democratization and other accepted international norms. In our view that would enhance both confidence in the Council on the part of the Members of the Organization and the acceptability of the Council's decisions. While the rapprochement between the super-Powers  as well as the prevailing international climate  has been instrumental in the resolution of long-standing conflicts  we should not be lulled into complacency. There are still many formidable obstacles to overcome in our quest for a more peaceful  secure  just and equitable new world order. Along with increased integration among States and increased democratic governance  we see centrifugal forces tearing States and societies apart  be it in Europe or in developing countries. Many of those conflicts are driven by ethnic  religious  racial or other sectarian differences and have resulted in the loss of many lives and the suffering of very large numbers of innocent people on account of displacement  the destruction of social and economic infrastructure  the breakdown of law and order  and the lack of food  medical facilities and shelter. Quite appropriately  these conflicts ought to be the focus of our attention in our deliberations. In addressing ourselves to such conflicts  it is legitimate for the international community to press for their peaceful and prompt resolution and to resort to such mechanisms as are deemed practical in coming to the immediate rescue  with humanitarian assistance  of those who are suffering. National sovereignty should not be invoked for the prevention of delivering needed humanitarian assistance to the innocent. In South Africa we were encouraged by the positive steps taken by Mr. De Klerk towards the dismantling of the apartheid apparatus. The repeal of the legislative pillars of apartheid the Population Registration Act  the Group Areas Act and the Land Act followed by the convening of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA)  gave us hope that at long last we were on the verge of putting in motion an irreversible process towards the establishment of a united  non-racial and democratic South Africa. It was therefore a matter of deep regret that the process was subsequently undermined and endangered by the violence which claimed thousands of lives among the black population. We vividly recall the carnage at Boipatong early this year and more recently in the Ciskei bantustan. The failure of. the South African Government to prevent and contain violence clearly raised doubts about the Pretoria Government's commitment to the process of fully dismantling apartheid and ushering into the country a truly democratic order. We welcome the recent talks between Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. De Klerk aimed at breaking the impasse. Those talks should give impetus to the process. The De Klerk Government needs to take drastic steps to control violence and to engender confidence in the negotiation process. It should also release all remaining political prisoners without delay. We commend the decision of the United Nations to station observers in South Africa at this time to monitor the situation and to assist in the process towards democratic change. It remains our conviction that many more observers are needed in order to ensure an effective international presence. This Organization has been at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid and it is imperative for it to stay the course until the objective is achieved. Uganda's position remains that until the apartheid constitution is scrapped and replaced with one which guarantees human rights and political freedoms to all South Africans on equal terms  we shall not have achieved our goal. While agreeable to the phasing out of sanctions in response to the progress registered  we believe the international community should maintain the necessary pressure to keep the South African Government negotiating in good faith. It is critical to agree on a constitution that enjoys the widest consensus. To that end  it becomes crucial for all parties in South Africa to take part in the negotiations and for South African leaders and the international community to spare no effort in encouraging all necessary consultations to ensure that no significant group feels left out. The events in South Africa have a great impact on developments elsewhere in southern Africa. Apartheid has always been a source of destabilization for the region  especially for the front-line States  with Angola and Mozambique being the most affected. Over the years  those countries have been the object of a destabilization campaign that encouraged fratricidal internal conflicts. We are glad to note that in both countries progress has been made towards reconciliation and the comprehensive resolution of their internal conflicts. Angola has just held an election in which all the parties have participated. The United Nations  through the United Nations Angola Verification Mission  (UNAVEM) II  has greatly contributed to the creation of an atmosphere conducive to reconciliation. In Mozambique  the Government and RENAMO have reached an accord  which is spelt out in the Joint Declaration signed in Rome. We welcome that accord  and it is our hope that a cease-fire agreement will soon be signed so as to facilitate elections and pave the way for an enduring peace. Mozambique  Angola and other front-line States have borne the brunt of the struggle against apartheid. Their economic and social infrastructures have  in the process  been damaged. Their economies will therefore take a long time to recover. The long drought they are currently experiencing has compounded these problems. I wish to call on the international community to render them the requisite assistance for their economic recovery and development. In Somalia we have a disaster of enormous proportions which  on the one hand  is man-made and  on the other  is compounded by drought. Both the OAU and African leaders in the regional and subregional contexts have made strenuous efforts to resolve the underlying political differences  but without success. Last Saturday President Museveni of my country  with a view to promoting dialogue between the parties  had discussions with  among others  Somali interim President Ali Mahdi and General Farah Aideed of the United Somali Congress  in which he appealed to both of them to resolve their differences. Already the conflict has brought misery and massive loss of life to the Somali people. A major problem now is that the continued fighting is making it extremely difficult to distribute food. We appeal to the various groups in Somalia to put an end to the conflict. We commend the efforts of the United Nations and its agencies  such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)  at providing humanitarian assistance  and we call on the international community to increase support for this initiative. We appeal to the various groups involved in the fighting in Somalia to cooperate with the United Nations and work for national reconciliation. We support the call by the current OAU Chairman  President Abdou Diouf of Senegal  for the convening of an international conference on Somalia after due preparation. The Secretary-General  in his annual report and in ""An Agenda for Peace""  underscores the role of regional and subregional efforts in defusing tension and in working out long-term solutions. We agree with the Secretary-General's observations. In East Africa the efforts of our Heads of State have gone a long way towards finding long-term solutions to regional problems  in particular that of refugees. The joint commissions we have with our neighbours have been most helpful as confidence-building measures. The United Nations should be supportive of our efforts. As regards Liberia  Uganda will continue to support the initiative of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for a peaceful settlement. The groups in Liberia should cooperate with the EOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) and abide by the terms of the accord they reached at Yamoussoukro  which were recently reaffirmed by the Dakar summit of ECOWAS  especially with regard to demobilization and peaceful transition to democratic governance. There is also need for active involvement of the United Nations to assist the subregion in preventing the situation from getting* worse. The conflict in southern Sudan has been a source of anguish for us. The people in this area have for long experienced the agony of war with the attendant loss of lives and the problems of refugees and population displacement. The path towards a long-term solution lies in dialogue and reconciliation among the parties in the Sudan. Time is of the essence in this situation. Uganda appreciates and encourages the efforts of President Babangida and of the OAU towards this end. I wish to register our gratitude to the international community for coming to the rescue of. the civilian population with humanitarian aid. It is our hope that both the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) will facilitate the international humanitarian relief effort  which at the moment is  regrettably  suspended  with only little help reaching the affected population. Uganda commends the fruitful regional and international initiatives for the resolution of the social and armed conflict in Rwanda. Uganda acknowledges and supports the ongoing dialogue  under Tanzanian mediation  between the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front  in accordance with agreements and recommendations reached in regional conferences and under OAU auspices. Uganda appreciates the constructive and helpful role played by the international observers in these negotiations. As to Western Sahara  Security Council resolution 690 (1991) remains the only agreed basis for the resolution of the problem. It is our hope that the obstacles with regard to the criteria of eligibility to vote will soon be resolved so that the way can be paved for holding the referendum as envisaged in the settlement plan. The Middle East crisis  at the core of which is the question of Palestine  has been one of the most intractable problems on the agenda of the United Nations. Peace in the region will continue to be elusive if a solution is not found to that question. Uganda thus welcomed the United States initiative in launching negotiations between all the parties concerned  beginning with the Madrid conference last year. While we regret that no breakthrough has yet been made  we are encouraged that the dialogue is still continuing. We call on the parties to persist in their negotiations  remove mutual suspicion  engender confidence  and grapple with the real issues that will bring forward a comprehensive  just and durable solution. Uganda welcomed the restoration of Kuwait's independence  in which the United Nations played a key role. It is our hope that with the Gulf War behind us  it will be possible to restore prosperity and to refocus the energies of the countries in the region on economic and social development. As regards Cyprus  we support the Secretary-General's efforts to reach an agreement on fundamental principles for an overall settlement. We maintain  our position that the settlement should safeguard the sovereignty  unity and territorial integrity of Cyprus. In the Korean peninsula  Uganda continues to be supportive of the aspirations of the Korean people for peaceful reunification. We wish to encourage them in their dialogue for. this purpose.* In Cambodia  we note the progress made by the United Nations Transitional Authority in implementing the agreements for a comprehensive political settlement. It is for us a matter of regret that there are problems with regard to the second phase of the cease-fire regarding the regrouping  cantoning and disarming of the various armed forces. We call on all parties to the agreements to live up to their undertakings so that peace and stability can return to that country. Uganda has been deeply concerned at the continuing conflict in the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia was a pillar of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. It contributed a lot to the Movement and to the struggle for the independence of our States when the cold war was at its height. It is  therefore  a source of great anguish to see that in its breakup  Yugoslavia has become a region of instability  strife and war based on ethnic and religious differences. We reject the notion of ""ethnic cleansing"" as being repugnant to accepted norms. The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has been functioning under very dangerous and trying circumstances. It deserves our maximum support as it endeavours to restore peace in the area. We call on the parties to embrace the path of peace and reconciliation. In the field of disarmament  Uganda welcomes the successful conclusion of the negotiations regarding the Convention on the complete and effective prohibition of the development  production and stockpiling of chemical weapons and on their destruction  which is due to be submitted to the Assembly at this session for adoption. As a party to the non-proliferation Treaty  Uganda also looks forward to actively participating in the preparation for the 1995 Review Conference  which will decide on the extension of the Treaty. It is our hope that the review will strengthen the Treaty by removing the present imbalances  and result in increased assistance to developing countries in the peaceful application of nuclear energy. Uganda is happy to see that the question of human rights has a place of pride on the international agenda. In both our domestic and our foreign policies  we give high priority to this issue. As part of its commitment to this end  a preoccupation of my Government has been to strengthen the rule of law and our capacity to enforce those rights. We regard the proper training of law enforcement officials as crucial. Therefore  this has been given due priority in our programmes. Currently  Uganda has embarked on a process for the enactment of a new constitution that should have built-in safeguards for fundamental human rights and political freedoms. I wish to place on record our appreciation to those countries that are rendering assistance to Uganda in this regard. Uganda looks forward to the third World Conference on Human Rights scheduled to take place in Vienna next year. That Conference should provide us with an opportunity to enhance the implementation of existing human rights instruments  to develop new norms where necessary  and to examine fully the intrinsic relationship between human rights and development. It has been emphasized that people must be at the centre of development. We agree. This requires us to strive for the attainment of social justice and equality for all peoples. Our avowed commitment for human rights and democracy cannot be taken seriously if it is not equally matched with a commitment to address the problems of underdevelopment  mass poverty and the social misery in which the overwhelming majority of the world population is trapped. Durable peace can only be anchored in the bedrock of economic progress among and within nations.  Regrettably  as we approach the next millennium  the economic and social problems of the developing countries continue to worsen. The overall external environment remains unfavourable  with most of our countries confronted with worsening terms of trade  a crippling debt burden and a reduction in the flow of resources earmarked for development. While there is increasing integration in the process of production and the globalization of world trade  the trend of marginalization of the least developed countries continues. Of grave concern is the critical economic situation in Africa. The Secretary-General in his annual report aptly describes the plight of Africa as follows: ""Most Africans are poorer today than they were when their countries achieved independence in the late 1950s and 1960s. The continent as a whole accounts for 32 out of the world's 47 least developed countries. Africa is the only low-income region in the world where the number of people living in poverty is  if the current trends continue  likely to increase by the year 2000. It is also the only region of the world whose total debt equals or exceeds its economic output. The freshly-witnessed momentum for political pluralism in Africa can hardly withstand a continuing assault by desertification  famine and deprivation. Poverty is infertile soil for democracy. It breeds a search for survival that cannot be held back by national frontiers. The African countries need to become masters of their economic destiny in a more supportive global framework."" (A/47/1  para. 62) In response to this plight  the General Assembly adopted at its forty-sixth session  in resolution 46/151  the New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s  whose objective is to accelerate the transformation  integration and diversification of African economies. The New Agenda aims at achieving an average real growth rate in gross national product of about 6 per cent a year through the decade  paying special attention to such goals as increased life expectancy  lower rates of child and maternal mortality  and improved health  water  sanitation  basic education and shelter. Most African countries have undertaken major reforms of their internal economic policies and mechanisms. In Uganda  for example  we are committed to the liberalization of the economy and have enacted an attractive foreign investment code. These reforms can be meaningful only if the external economic environment is supportive and there is a positive response in the form of increased investment and trade. It will be recalled that the United Nations Programme of Action for African Recovery and Development 1986-1990 did not achieve its objectives because of the failure of the international community to provide the requisite resources. For the New Agenda to succeed  therefore  our partners must have the political will to live up to their commitments. The System-Wide Plan of Action which is before the General Assembly provides a framework for the United Nations system to give more focussed attention to Africa. In this regard  Uganda strongly welcomes the International Conference for Assistance to African Children  scheduled to take place in Dakar in November  and we commend the United Nations Children's Fund for the preparatory work already undertaken. We appeal to the international agencies to earmark resources for the implementation of the New Agenda. In this connection  we commend the International Fund for Agricultural Development's Special Programme for Sub-Saharan Africa. I also wish to register my appreciation to the Government of Japan for initiating and arranging to host  in 1993  an African development conference that will bring together African countries  major aid donors and international agencies to discuss ways and means of accelerating African economic development. Two major conferences were held last year: the Eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VIII) and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which culminated in Agenda 21. It is necessary to maintain the momentum achieved at Rio and at UNCTAD VIII by putting in place measures to implement those decisions. The Rio Summit established a clear link between environment  growth and development. The need to help developing countries achieve sustainable development was underscored. It is our hope that the Uruguay Round will soon be successfully completed and that it will remove the impediments to our products reaching the markets of the industrialized countries. In the report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277)  issued as a follow-up to the statement adopted at the conclusion of the Security Council's historic Summit meeting of 31 January 1992  the Secretary-General outlines his proposals on how the United Nations role in the maintenance of international peace and security can be strengthened. The report contains a number of useful proposals on preventive diplomacy  peacemaking  peace-building and the role of regional groupings which  if adopted  will enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations. We agree that regional arrangements in many cases possess a potential for early warning of. monitoring and defusing conflict situations  a potential that should be realized. The United Nations and the international community should help them to improve that capability. The Organization of African Unity  for example  is in the process of trying to establish a mechanism for conflict-prevention  conflict management and conflict-resolution. Such a mechanism would strengthen the OAU's peace-keeping capabilities. Any assistance given in this regard will be an important and useful investment for peace and development in Africa. I wish to emphasize that  as indicated in the Secretary-General's annual report  underdevelopment and poverty are prime sources of conflict. The United Nations  through its macroeconomic policy formulation and implementation  has played a central role in forging global consensus on development issues. As envisaged by the United Nations Charter  the Organization must continue fulfilling this function  especially now  when many developing countries are restructuring with a view to integrating their nations into the global economy. We should therefore endeavour to integrate our agenda for peace with our agenda for development. By strengthening the Organization's peacemaking and peace-keeping capabilities  we should not  by default or neglect  reduce the United Nations focus on economic and social issues. Clearly  development and peace are so intimately related that they must be tackled under a common agenda. We stand at a historic watershed  especially given the fact that the global transition period we are entering is marked by contradictory trends. At this crossroads  however  a unique opportunity exists for the United Nations to achieve the objectives envisaged in the Charter. Whether or not the United Nations can help create a better world for the twenty-first century  in which the interests of us all are adequately catered for  depends on the structures we create now. History will judge us harshly if we fail to construct a firm foundation for the edifice of the future. That is our challenge."
"158",7149,"UKR",47,1992,"I should like to extend sincere congratulations to you  Sir  on your unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am especially pleased to see in this high post a representative of Bulgaria  a country that is linked to Ukraine by geographical and ethnic proximity and by centuries-old ties of friendship  cooperation and good-neighbourly relations. I should also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Shihabi  who made tireless efforts to strengthen the role of the General Assembly. We greatly appreciate the contribution that was made to the implementation of radical transformations in the United Nations by Mr. Perez de Cuellar  the former Secretary-General. His successor  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has embarked on the course of deepening the reforms  with the firm intention of enhancing the role and authority of the Organization  in response to the needs of our time. We will support these undertakings in every possible way. The current session of the General Assembly is being held during a period of profound and truly epoch-making transformations on our planet  which have included in the formation of a new world order the potential of the new States built on the ruins of the last empire in the history of mankind. The disintegration of the bankrupt totalitarian system  resulting in the largest increase in the membership of the United Nations in recent years  opened the way for the triumph of genuine freedom and democracy in vast areas of Europe and Asia and for the realization of the inalienable right of peoples to self-determination and has made it possible to place human rights at the focus of the policies of many newly emerged States. The people of Ukraine demonstrated through the centuries its firm desire for independence and its aspiration to a national  political and economic  renaissance. For hundreds of years Ukrainians' drive for freedom was subdued by giving them miserable pittances or by the use of violence and repression. But today  for the first time  our people have set out on the path leading to the temple of independence  and no one will ever make our people deviate from that historic path.  In August of this year we solemnly marked the first anniversary of our independence. That pivotal event in the life of our people was celebrated as the triumph of democracy and freedom. And today we are facing a task of great proportions: to build a democratic Ukraine governed by the rule of law  to revive the strength and intellectual potential of our people  to be worthy of the memory of our ancestors who sacrificed their lives in the struggle for independence. The fresh winds of change make it necessary to take a new look at the Charter of the United Nations  to activate fully its enormous creative potential and to free international relations from the burden of suspicion  hostility and the renewal of violence. The shortest way to that goal is through international relations based on common sense and on respect for freedom of choice  in keeping with the centuries-old principles of international law which are clearly understood  widely recognized and consistently applied. As early as the seventeenth century the celebrated Spanish theologian and philosopher Francisco Suarez observed that although States are not combined into a single political body  they are obliged to help one another and to maintain and defend law and peace  since that is imperative for the benefit of all mankind. A State that violates the law and disregards international agreements is thereby undermining the foundations of its own future tranquillity. The same vital philosophical ideas were also expounded by Hryhory Skovoroda  a Ukrainian philosopher  writer and thinker of the eighteenth century who stood for purity in public order and who inspired belief in the inevitable triumph of truth and justice. We attach great importance to strengthening the role of the United Nations in settling conflicts and resolving disputes. Although the threat of total military confrontation has receded  the tragic developments on the territory of former Yugoslavia  in Nagorny Karabakh  in Georgia  in the Dniester region and in other areas give us warning that local conflicts are fraught with serious danger. We believe that joint efforts by the international community can eliminate the deep-rooted causes of these conflicts  which are linked to unresolved national issues  to irresponsible appeals for the review of existing State frontiers  to economic hopelessness  to political egocentrism and to the messianic ambitions of some States seeking to create zones of their own special interests in certain parts of the world. The task of the United Nations is to establish a structure for interaction that would guarantee the security of every Member State. Our country can contribute to the attainment of that goal. In the year that has passed since the proclamation of our independence  Ukraine has traversed the road from a quasi-State within the former USSR to a universally recognized European State. Having joined the leading international political  humanitarian and monetary-financial institutions  our country has assumed full responsibility for securing its own foreign-policy interests and its external economic interests. Without claiming any special status in the world  we want to occupy a place in the international community worthy of our people  our history and our potential. We can make and we want to make a constructive contribution to international cooperation. Ukraine welcomes the changes in the political and military structure of Europe  where we are seeing the key role in maintaining peace and stability shift from military deterrence to political mechanisms. These changes have ensured the success of the process of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the possibility of shaping a new security model on the continent based on close interaction between the European States. I would like to emphasize that the orientation towards Europe is one of the main driving forces of our foreign policy; we intend to intensify the dynamics of our relations with European States and with their regional structures. We intend to pursue a serious  pragmatic and result-oriented policy with respect to the United Nations. That is why the Ukrainian Parliament decided to send a military contingent to take part in the United Nations peace-keeping mission in the territory of former Yugoslavia. Today Ukrainian soldiers are continuing to do their duty with honour and dignity in that suffering land. Their mission has won universal support and recognition. The transition of the contemporary world to a system of global integration  multipolarity and partnership demands the creation of a new concept of strategic stability based on a substantial and balanced reduction of existing arsenals of weapons to the dimensions of reasonable sufficiency for defence. The results achieved so far in bilateral efforts to limit armaments should be supplemented by new multilateral agreements  whose universality would provide the necessary level of confidence  strengthening trust in their implementation. We welcome the completion of the convention on the complete prohibition and destruction of chemical weapons. For Ukraine  which does not possess  produce or stockpile chemical weapons in its territory  signing the convention is one of the priorities in the field of disarmament. The question of eliminating all nuclear weapons is of fundamental significance for us. We are convinced that  with a well-adjusted system of collective security based on the Charter of the United Nations  it will be possible to prevent any aggression or  if necessary  to suppress it through joint efforts. Ukraine  which suffered the full effects of the Chernobyl disaster  is supporting with even greater determination the international campaign for the complete renunciation of nuclear testing and for the assumption by every nuclear-weapon State of an obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Simultaneously with its proclamation of independence  Ukraine opted to become a State possessing no nuclear weapons. Of course  Ukraine is not the only country in the world which has chosen non-nuclear status. But our uniqueness lies in the fact that we voluntarily took on the burden of eliminating hundreds of strategic and tactical nuclear warheads inherited from the USSR  a choice which has huge financial implications. Having set out on the path of reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons  we count on strict international guarantees of our national security against the possible threat or use of force by any nuclear State. I should point out that this is by no means a rhetorical question for our newly independent State  and we consider it in our own special context. Naturally  we count on understanding for our position.  Ukraine intends to accede in the very near future to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; it will place all its nuclear power plants and all fissionable materials under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We actively support the idea of creating a nuclear-free zone in the Black Sea basin. As is known  in the agreement between Ukraine and the Russian Federation  signed on 3 August of this year at Yalta  the two major Black Sea States officially declared the desirability of pursuing a policy aimed at making the Black Sea a nuclear-free zone and a zone of peace and cooperation. We regard the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe as the most important element of a new security system in Europe. The entry into force of the Treaty will make it possible to accelerate the process of European disarmament  to remove the remaining imbalances in armed forces and to eliminate unpredictability from the military and strategic situation on the Continent. The successful conclusion of negotiations on reducing the numbers of military personnel and on implementing the provisions of the Vienna Document on Confidence- and Security-building Measures opens new opportunities for strengthening stability in Europe. Together with other European countries  we welcome the conclusion of the ""open skies"" agreement as an important step towards mutual trust in military activities. Against the background of definite changes for the better in the area of arms limitation and disarmament  issues of strengthening international and regional stability take on special importance. Ukraine greatly appreciates the contribution made by the United Nations to the settlement of conflicts in the ""hot spots"" of the planet and its endeavours to restore peace to the Balkans and to normalize the situations in Cambodia  Cyprus  Central America and southern Africa. The experience acquired in this sphere proves that the most efficient actions are preventive actions aimed at lessening tension before it is transformed into open conflict between the opposing parties. The use of the methods of preventive diplomacy must become a priority feature of United Nations activity today. We support the ideas of the Secretary-General in this regard and the pragmatic proposals set forth in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). The normalization of the situation in the Persian Gulf  with the direct participation of the United Nations  is facilitating the intensification of efforts aimed at settling the Arab-Israeli conflict. Ukraine believes that a constructive dialogue on this problem at the current session of the General Assembly can foster the process of forging specific agreements that started in Madrid. Ukraine welcomes efforts aimed at stopping the violence in South Africa  and calls upon the Government and the representatives of all political forces in South Africa to continue resolutely the process of peaceful settlement. A few words about Ukraine's economic situation. The imperial system completely exhausted Ukraine's economy and unbalanced our economic mechanisms. Ukraine inherited a predominantly obsolete technology  a backward infrastructure  the burden of foreign debt  a lack of skilled managerial staff  low living standards for the population and galloping inflation. However  we are convinced that independence  the development of democracy and juridical institutions and the implementation of far-reaching political and economic reforms will enable us to weather the transition to a market economy without critical social upheavals during the transition period and will create the necessary conditions for the integration of Ukraine into the system of world economic relations. In carrying out the tasks before us  we must rely primarily on our own strength  on the talent and industriousness of our people. But at the same time  we greatly appreciate outside support for our efforts: foreign investment  and the furnishing of financial and advisory assistance and expertise by the most developed countries of the world and by international organizations. We call for concerted action to overcome the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster  a tragedy unprecedented in the history of mankind  and for joint efforts by various countries in solving the complex and unparalleled problems it caused. We hope that the present session of the General Assembly will yield solutions appropriate to the scope of that tragedy. Our economic difficulties  the foreign debt inherited from the former Soviet Union and the Chernobyl factor make it impossible for Ukraine to meet fully its financial obligations to the United Nations. However  I wish to state that this problem is constantly being given attention by the Parliament and Government of Ukraine. At the same time  Ukraine cannot agree to a merely mechanical approach to the question how the contribution of the former Soviet Union is to be apportioned. We strongly object to the decisions taken at the last session of the Committee on Contributions that  contrary to the existing criteria  recommended increasing Ukraine's contribution for the next year by over 50 per cent. We shall strive for a radical revision of the system used for formulating the scale of assessment  bringing it into conformity with the present-day realities  levels of development and ability to pay of Member States. The pressure of economic problems is naturally bound to influence the social situation in our country. However  our efforts to promote respect for international standards in the field of human rights and protection of the interests of national minorities were instrumental in avoiding ethnicity-based conflicts in Ukraine. At the same time  we understand the concerns expressed from this rostrum regarding ""discriminatory practices""  against Ukrainians and all other non-indigenous nationalities  which are growing stronger in some of the new States that have emerged in the territory of the former USSR. We hope that all States in whose territory Ukrainians reside will demonstrate genuine concern and consideration for their cultural  linguistic and religious needs. That hope was voiced with full force in the statements of the participants in the World Forum of Ukrainians  which recently brought to Kiev thousands of representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora  who had been forced to live far from their native land. At a time when human lives are at stake and people are dying of famine in some parts of the world  the problem of humanitarian aid should play a key role in the activities of the United Nations and of its social and economic organs. Our country  in the light of its own past  is devoting special attention to this question. Another humanitarian problem requires special attention because unless it is resolved  it will stand in the way of strengthening the principles of civilized relations in international life. I am referring to the question of prisoners of war. While supporting the steps taken by the new leadership of Afghanistan in establishing peace and reconciliation in that country  I should like to appeal to it to do its utmost to ensure an immediate search for and arrange the unconditional return of Ukrainian nationals who are still being kept prisoner or are missing in action. At the same time  we call upon all States in whose territory prisoners of war are being held to make the humane gesture of releasing the victims of military conflicts. This would also contribute to the success of the forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights. In my statement  I have touched upon some unresolved issues that are preventing us from moving ahead. However  none of these problems  we believe  can impede the renaissance of the United Nations stimulated by the end of the cold war and the resulting favourable changes in the world. I can assure everyone present in this hall that Ukraine is determined to participate in the work of the United Nations which will continue to remain a crucial element of our foreign policy  and we will do everything possible to ensure that the Organization enters the next millennium as an effective instrument in building a better world. "
"159",7195,"URY",47,1992,"Allow me to congratulate you  Sir  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. In your election can be seen an unequivocal indication of rejoicing at the establishment of democracy in your country. It is also fitting today for us to welcome the States of Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Slovenia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to our community of nations. Their participation as Member States guarantees observance of the principle of universality  an essential element of the very life and existence of the Organization. We congratulate Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to whom my people and country have had numerous occasions to express their esteem and their hopes  as he undertakes his difficult and very important mission as the new Secretary-General  continuing the brilliant work of Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar. Last year  taking note of the dizzying acceleration of world events  we put forward our views on the consequences of the collapse of what was called the old order that was born during the cold war  and our view regarding the attitude that the international community should assume in the face of the new and emerging international situation. We said and today we have even more reason to reiterate that the spectacular changes in the former distribution of power would not necessarily lead us to the heralded new international order  although such changes opened up the possibility of our being able to achieve strict  rigorous observance of the fundamental principles of the Charter. That prospect gave us a sense of realistic optimism with regard to the future  though we never lost sight of all the negative elements in existence today that stand in the way of the full acknowledgement of the existence of a true ""order"". The success of the effective functioning of the mechanisms of collective security that were put into operation during the Gulf crisis is not enough. The important point is  essentially  that each and every one of the States of the international community should  in accordance with its capability for action and hence with its responsibilities  adapt its conduct to the principles of the Charter  which are the basic principles of law and ethics; and those principles should be strictly complied with  making of that form of conduct a consistent practice. This year we find ourselves facing a new and grave quaking of international security as a result of the outbreak in Europe of the most brutal conflict to take place on the old continent since the Second World War. In our view  it is the responsibility of the international community  in the face of that situation  to ensure the finding of a solution that goes beyond the national interests involved and beyond consideration of our geographical distance from or proximity to the conflict. We view with grave concern the atrocities that have been committed  the reports of the concentration of civilians in detention camps  as well as the horrendous violations of human rights and the persistent disregard for international humanitarian law that are taking place in that region. We see how cardinal principles of international law are being violated  such as territorial integrity and sovereignty  which leads to disregard for the true and genuine meaning of self-determination. Furthermore  we view with alarm the extraordinary introduction of the racial factor into international relations and the emergence of the invocation of doctrines such as that of ""ethnic cleansing"" to justify serious violations of international law and of human rights. We therefore once again most forcefully reiterate our condemnation of those practices and our exhortation to implement steps collectively worked out  in the context of international law  that enhance the effectiveness of United Nations mechanisms across the board. The decision adopted by the General Assembly on 19 September as to the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in the United Nations was supported by Uruguay. It was the only position that could indeed be taken in the light of the circumstances. This did not involve a case of exclusion  nor a situation such as those envisaged under Articles 5 and 6 in the Charter  but rather involved the finding that it was impossible  on the basis of incontrovertible facts  that that State could automatically take over the seat of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This means that the new State will have to apply for admission as a Member of the United Nations  pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 of the Charter. The situation in that region  along with the tragedy being endured in Somalia and elsewhere  compels us to reaffirm the duty  based on the principles of solidarity and cooperation  to provide humanitarian aid. That duty  which implies an acknowledgement of the corresponding right  must be conceived of and implemented within the context of international law  without doing violence to other essential principles. Humanitarian aid must be decided upon by competent international bodies  by implementation of law  and must not serve as a cover for disguised or veiled forms of unlawful intervention  whether on an individual or a collective basis. We welcome the encouraging turn that in recent weeks has been taking place in the talks aimed at bringing the peace process in the Middle East back on track. The traditional and unswerving friendship of the Uruguayan people with the Arab and Jewish peoples  along with the excellent diplomatic relations our Government maintains with the Arab countries and with the State of Israel  are all factors that induce us to lend our vigorous support to the common guest for peace in that region  a peace that must be based on guaranteed security for all the States in the region  on respect for territorial integrity  on the right to self-determination of all peoples and on the full applicability of human rights. The Government of Uruguay here reaffirms its determination to contribute to peaceful and harmonious fellowship between Arabs and Jews  both essential protagonists of civilization  and reaffirms as well its commitment to deepening its ties with the States of the Middle East. We have before us an invaluable working document prepared by the Secretary-General. That document  with whose principles and approach we fully agree  gives rise to thoughts that we cannot fail to voice here. In this day and age  faced as we are with the global dimensions of the problems of peace and security  and confronted with situations that demand universal answers situations that it is impossible to cope with through partial or territorially limited approaches  such as issues relating to the environment  drug trafficking and terrorism we must rethink the question of sovereignty: not so as to weaken its essence  which continues to represent the underpinning of our international Organization  but rather to adapt it to current requirements  which are necessary for us to build a world based on peace and solidarity  and to act on the basis of the defence and protection of the interests of the global community as a whole  a precept that  according to Francisco de Vitoria  lies at the roots of the rights of peoples. This concept of humanitarianist universalism precludes the recognition of any legitimacy in the exercise of power by any individual Power outside the framework of international law. The report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/227) presents in an organic and intelligent fashion a set of proposals to implement  within the new international context  a systematic process of preventive diplomacy. We fundamentally share its goals and the essential aspects of the global view upon which it draws. We must give the Secretary-General the political backing he needs for him to act with the necessary flexibility and effectiveness  in line with the concepts that he has set forth. We agree with the need to seek a greater balance between the Security Council and the General Assembly. Moreover  we welcome the fact that this report incorporates a proposal that Uruguay has always advocated  namely the wish that all our Member States unreservedly accept the competency of the International Court of Justice. We do not doubt the need to strengthen peace-keeping operations. In that connection  our country intends to preach by example. Uruguay has now increased to unprecedented levels the number of members of its armed forces and police forces made available to the United Nations  as measured against the size of our military forces and our population. By way of example  more than 900 members of our armed forces are currently participating in the peace-keeping operations in Cambodia  and a general from our Republic is commanding the United Nations contingent in Kashmir. To consolidate and guarantee international security  there can be no delay in moving ahead with the process of disarmament that is currently under way. It must be expanded integrally in breadth and in depth. We must halt any new spiralling of the arms race  whether this be on the global  regional or local level. Along those lines  Latin America and the Caribbean have been marking this particular phase in the evolution of international relations with a noteworthy effort to complete what in and of itself already constitutes a vast zone of peace. I should like to highlight the notable effort undertaken by Latin America  in which Uruguay has participated actively from the very outset  to amend the Tlatelolco Treaty in such a way as to enable Cuba to sign it  Argentina to ratify it and Brazil and Chile to submit their reservations to it. These amendments  which have already been adopted and have also resulted in France's ratification of Additional Protocol I  have ensured that the first nuclear-weapon-free zone  covering all of Latin America and the Caribbean  has come into real  total and full existence. Uruguay firmly supports the adoption of the Convention on chemical weapons developed by the Disarmament Conference. The mushrooming of regional armed conflicts compels us to give thought to new or renewed forms of cooperation in and coordination of world-wide and regional efforts to resolve differences and to enable us to act in the face of threats to and aggression against peace and security. Latin America  which today is a continent of peace and is resolving territorial or border disputes by legal and peaceful means  where there are no morbid outbreaks of xenophobia and racial hatred  and which is fighting  as never before in its history  to solve the problems of its indigenous peoples and of human rights  has a particular talent for setting up this necessary world-wide and regional coordination. The recent judgment handed down by the International Court of Justice concerning a territorial dispute between Honduras and El Salvador  and accepted by both parties; the submission to an arbitration tribunal of a border dispute between Argentina and Chile; and the new and positive spirit reigning in the dialogue between Ecuador and Peru aimed at solving the long-standing conflict that has pitted these two fraternal countries against each other bear witness to the example Latin America is setting. The duty all the States that make up the international community have to guarantee and protect human rights does not flow only from the international obligations that result from treaties in force; respect for human rights is born of the United Nations Charter and of the Universal Declaration. Furthermore  it is a principle of jus cogens which  if violated  entails international answerability and renders null all legal instruments contrary to this imperative law which originates in the will of the international community as a whole. The protection of human rights at world and regional levels has made signal progress in the law of nations of today  and the process of improvement must continue. It is not  however  solely by developing international instruments for the protection of human rights that we shall achieve generalized respect for human rights. We must work hard to universalize a culture of human rights that would uproot from people's minds and behaviour intolerance  violence  hatred  and contempt for the dignity that each and every individual on the planet naturally has. The affirmation and dissemination of that culture of human rights is the great challenge that mankind must meet in the decades ahead. The resurgence amongst us  in what for us is the cradle of Western civilization  of racism  racial intolerance and animosity rooted in ethnic  religious and cultural differences is cause for great alarm. These manifestations are compounded by episodes  not that far distant geographically  of forced population transfers  the appearance of detention camps and the commission of atrocities and practices that once again amount to a shameful blot on our contemporary civilization. The international community cannot close its eyes to these things  nor fail to act in the face of this terrible and unacceptable situation. Uruguay hopes that the holding of the forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights will be a historic landmark for the future in terms of respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms. Global stability is generally and permanently threatened by the vast amount and extent of grinding poverty. Apart from the fundamental  ethical reasons that inspire us all  there are security considerations that should make us tackle this widespread situation as a whole. This is why the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have decided to support the initiative put forward by our sister republic of Chile that a world summit on social development should be held in 1995. We welcome the fact that this concern caused this initiative to be included in the ""Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277) put before us by the Secretary-General  and that it has been approved by the Economic and Social Council. Because of its modi operandi that pay no attention to frontiers and because of the way it is organized  drug trafficking has become one of the most serious types of international crime. Uruguay insists that this form of modern-day aggression must be combated in all its various phases and manifestations. The capacity of the United Nations to act must be strengthened in such a way as to complement and assist the concerted action which our own countries must take by means of regional as much as global bilateral and multilateral instruments. The need to achieve economic development on terms compatible with conserving the environment is a priority objective for our country. We are concerned at the fact that the Rio Conference did not result in the adoption of more specific and effective commitments. What concerns us far more  however  is the risk that the principles enshrined in the Rio Declaration and in the programme of action agreed upon in Agenda 21 might remain a kind of catalogue of good intentions without any practical and effective application. The solemn adoption of those documents  and even the signing of the Conventions on biodiversity and climatic change  which Uruguay will shortly ratify  are not going to halt the progressive deterioration in the environment. Although those documents are major contributions  the polluting' activities that threaten our present and jeopardize our future have not stopped with their signing and will not stop once their hopefully rapid entry into force has occurred. We are all aware that the success or the failure of the process of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) hinges on the total and effective implementation of those commitments. The road to Rio was difficult. However  more arduous still will be the road to be travelled from Rio on. States will have to shoulder their legal responsibilities and to implement the actual measures laid down in Agenda 21. Governments will have to agree to transform into legally binding obligations the principles of conduct  liability and compensation emanating from the Stockholm Declaration and later endorsed and developed in the Rio Declaration  which are considerably more than moral obligations. While today they are obligations stemming from international ordinary law  they are  moreover  authentic criteria embodied in jus cogens  and are valid eroa omnes. However  notwithstanding the foregoing  it is time to avoid ambiguous interpretations as to the real juridical value of these obligations. The President of Uruguay  in his address delivered at the Rio Conference  stated the determination of my country to propose the codification of those principles in a binding legal instrument. We will consider the most opportune time and place for giving practical effect to our initiative  even contributing a draft convention. At the same time  this approach will have to be complemented by implementation of the plan of action agreed upon in Agenda 21. We know this objective implies collecting huge financial resources and adopting large-scale measures of technology transfers. We trust that the developed countries that have accepted the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility will find the political will needed for taking the lead in this effort. While appearing to be a great sacrifice  this action is an investment that brooks no delay for preserving the present and ensuring the future. Specific proof of Uruguay's priority interest in environmental problems is that we have agreed that the next meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Basel Convention on Toxic and Hazardous Wastes should be held in our country. The changes that have been progressively noted in the political arena stand in dramatic contrast to the adverse trends that are ever more exacerbating international economic relations. We view with concern the fact that the crucial issue of development would appear to have been relegated to the back-burner amongst issues on the international economic agenda. Just as early in the 1980s the problem was the external debt situation in the developing countries  at the beginning of the 1990s one can say that it is the inconsistencies in the macroeconomic and trade policies that jeopardize world economic growth and international monetary stability. While the developing countries are redoubling their efforts at achieving adjustment  liberalization  deregulation and adaptation to new world realities  recessionary trends and low rates of growth in the industrialized countries  their bloated budgetary deficits  their increasing levels of indebtedness  the resurgence of their protectionist policies and the lack of coordination among their monetary and parity policies are factors creating major counterweights to any revitalization of the world economy  to any increase in trade and change in trade policy and to world-wide capital flows. All this highlights the need for a better analysis and greater coordination of economic policies the world over. In recent years we have witnessed a major process of reorganization in world trade  owing to two major trends unfolding side by side. On the one hand  efforts have been made in the context of the Uruguay Round aimed at guaranteeing an open international marketplace through a process of liberalizing and expanding trade  while strengthening multilateral rules and discipline within the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). On the other hand  great economic blocs have emerged  in whose hands are concentrated most of the world's wealth  major trade flows  investment flows and flows of technological know-how. If these blocs wish to move towards development and general progress  they will have to evolve as open markets. I am convinced this evolution will depend on what happens or fails to happen in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations of GATT  which today have become all but paralysed and are seriously jeopardized. Failure in the Uruguay Round would be very serious and would trigger serious adverse repercussions for the world economy as a whole. It would send an extremely negative signal to economic operators  would open the doors to unilateralism and to relations based upon power  and would lead to an escalation of protectionism and an intensification of trade conflicts. Thus  we must urgently call upon all participants in the Uruguay Round and  in particular  to those countries responsible for the main disagreements pending  to join their efforts and to make their positions more flexible so as to conclude the negotiations quickly and satisfactorily  with equitable results that would promote the liberalization of trade and avoid protectionist discrimination. Within the United Nations  the current process of revitalization and restructuring the Organization in the economic and social fields must be seen as constructive. In this regard  we welcome the results of the eighth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and those of the first meeting of the revamped Economic and Social Council  held in New York last July. This process of revitalization must be pursued and intensified. The United Nations cannot stay on the sidelines of policy formulation with regard to the most important economic  financial and trade issues. What is urgently needed is a determined effort aimed at institutional and operational revitalization and the restoration of the indispensable credibility of the United Nations so that the Organization can fill the great institutional void that currently exists in the field of international economic relations and can successfully discharge its responsibilities. Only thus will we manage to lay the groundwork for the more constructive and effective international cooperation that would make it possible to halt and reverse the adverse trends that prevail in the economic field. In this regard  my country gives particular importance to the role UNCTAD is called upon to play as the forum to further international economic relations that are conducive to development. I cannot fail to mention the major effort my country has been making  together with Argentina  Brazil and Paraguay  to establish a common market of the South in 1995. The various processes laid down in the Treaty of Asuncion and in the timetable adopted by the Presidents of the four States parties at the meeting in Las LeSas  Argentina  are being fully implemented. Thus  the process of subregional integration has already become the axis round which revolve our policies of development  renewal  openness and modernization  prompting us to look to the future with renewed optimism and conviction. Uruguay  a State that cherishes peace  a founding Member of the United Nations  respectful of a democratic and pluralist law based on solidarity  is today taking part in this Assembly in the same spirit as always determined to cooperate in building a world governed by the law of nations  just and peace-loving  with a universal international Organization capable of ensuring development and human rights while effectively and actively guaranteeing peace and security.

"160",7243,"USA",47,1992,"Forty-seven years ago I was a young man of 21  and  like thousands of others of my generation  I had gone off to war to help keep freedom alive. Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over  and I was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: 1945 marked a moment of promise  not just for me  but for all of mankind. A great struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the globe  we all looked forward to a future free of war  a world where we might raise our children in peace and freedom  and this institution  the United Nations  born amidst the ashes of war  embodied those hopes and dreams like no other. But the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist imperialism divided the world in two  our hopes for peace and our dreams of freedom were frozen in the grip of cold war  and  instead of finding a common ground  we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill's The President returned to the Chair. ""broad  sunlit uplands""  millions found that there was  as Arthur Koestler so chillingly wrote  ""Darkness at Noon"". Instead of uniting the nations  this body became a forum for distrust and division among nations and  in a cruel irony  the United Nations  created to free the world of conflict  itself became conflict's captive. I too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit  proudly so; I served in this Assembly and I saw  in my time  the consequences of the cold war's hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now  47 years later  we stand at the end of another war  the cold war  and our hopes and dreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and banished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom  imperial communism has collapsed in its birthplace  and today Russia has awakened democratic  independent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine  Armenia  Belarus  Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the nations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished  and we are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not have to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack  as the generation before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders with nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin  Kravchuk  Nazarbayev  Shushkevich who joined me in ending the super-Power stand-off that risked nuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as truly independent and free nations  and to you and the leaders of the other independent States  I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. With the cold war's end  I believe we have a unique opportunity to go beyond artificial divisions of a first  second and third world to forge instead a genuine  global community of free and sovereign nations  a community built on respect for principle  on peaceful settlement of disputes  on fundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and free markets. Already  the United Nations  especially the Security Council  has done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global community. United Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and brokering peace the entire world over  but securing democracy and securing the peace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may have been vanquished  but that does not end the challenges of our age  challenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions between East and West  North and South  that fuel strife and strain and conflict and war. As we support the historic growth of democracy around the world  I believe the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical  interrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. First  we face the political challenge of keeping today's peace and preventing tomorrow's wars. As we see daily in Bosnia  Somalia and Cambodia  everywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping capabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have never been more intractable  the costs of conflict higher. Second  we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  truly the fastest growing security challenge to international peace and order. Third  we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for all  of strengthening an open  growth-oriented  free-market international economic order while safeguarding the environment. Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective engagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and  above all  it will require that each of us look seriously at our own Government and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the promises of today  if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace.  With you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: peace-keeping  proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this opportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can work together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. Let me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and distinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus and Lebanon  to Cambodia and Croatia  the blue beret has become a symbol of hope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a central role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars  and strengthening peace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But  as much as the United Nations has done  it can do much more. Peace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their services increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive peace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may become especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case because of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron curtain  peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen in communism's catacomb. Where this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and civility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms  this new democratic nationalism is all to the good. But  unfortunately  we need only look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to see the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe  with Russia and  Eurasia  even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  the Western European Union (WEU)  the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional organizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. We are convinced  however  that enhanced United Nations capabilities are a necessary complement to these regional efforts  not just in Europe and Eurasia  but across the globe. I welcome the Secretary-General's call for a new agenda to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to prevent  contain and resolve conflicts across the globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to advance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the merits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the Secretary-General's proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key areas. First  robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member States can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for possible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and with the approval  of course  of the Governments providing it. Secondly  if multinational units are to work together  they must train together. Many nations for example  Fiji  Norway  Canada and Finland have a long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we train for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also require coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both equipment and communications. Multinational planning  training  field exercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional organizations. Thirdly  we also need to provide adequate logistical support for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate stockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies  including famines  floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a crisis. Fourthly  we will need to develop planning  crisis management and intelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Fifthly  we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations and associated peace-keeping efforts. As I said  we must change our national institutions if we are to change our international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is ready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international peace-keeping. For decades  the American military has served as a stabilizing presence around the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning wars  in keeping the peace  to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on peace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping's growing importance as a mission for the United States military  we will emphasize training of combat  engineering and logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian activities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our considerable lift  logistics  communications and intelligence capabilities to support peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for joint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint peace-keeping operations. There is room for all countries  large and small  and I hope all will play a part. Member States  as always  must retain the final decision on the use of their troops  of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate peace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace arises or when people in need look to the world for help. I have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping curriculum in United States military schools. Training  plainly  is a key element. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and facilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base  nearby  with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold war and today  with that war over  they can help build a lasting peace. The United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the United Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and operations for peace-keeping  and we will also broaden American support for monitoring  verification  reconnaissance and other requirements of United Nations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. And  finally  the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United Nations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do believe that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our security in this new era. While the cold war may have ended  the super-Power nuclear arms competition  regional competition  weapons of mass destruction continue. Over 20 countries have  or are developing  nuclear  chemical or biological weapons  and the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its former adversaries are engaged in deep  historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals  our children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and unstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for non-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its intention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was negotiated  I propose that the Security Council reassure the non-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance  in accordance with the Charter  to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to the non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an object of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can strengthen linkages between the suppliers ""clubs""  the nuclear-suppliers group  the Australia Group  the missile-technology control regime and United Nations specialized agencies. Here I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction programme  and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop proliferation  so too must every Member State change its structures to advance our non-proliferation goals. In that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the United States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical support for non-proliferation  weapons monitoring and destruction  and global defence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State  ACDA should be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but  just as importantly  in providing technical assistance on our new security agenda. Even as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  we must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already taking place. Therefore  we are working towards a cooperative system for defence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have other nations participate in this global protection system. While expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation efforts will be critical for building an enduring peace  shared economic growth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next century. That is why I stated yesterday  during a moment of international uncertainty  that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global partners in building a global economic  financial and trading structure for this new era. At the same time  I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to examine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process  and I affirmed America's support for a European integration that opens markets and enhances Europe's capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we face in this new era. While the exact form of integration is  of course  for Europeans to determine  we will stand by them. Economic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant  growing world economy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared by all  fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic engine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of the negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as soon as possible  and to create a network of free-trade agreements  beginning with the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the same time  we need to recognize that we have a shared responsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to build growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in the new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private sector to build these new economies  not by fostering dependency with traditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. After the Second World War  foreign assistance often served as a weapon in the cold war. Obviously  we will still use critical foreign-assistance funds to meet legitimate security needs. And  as our humanitarian operations in Somalia and northern Iraq  Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify  we will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those suffering from man-made and natural disasters. But foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation and mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a nation relies on the private sector and free markets  the higher its rate of growth; the more open to trade it is  the higher its rate of growth; and the better a country's investment climate  the higher its rate of growth. To move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership  we propose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance programmes to building strong  independent economies that can become contributors to a healthy  growing global economy. That means that our new emphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors that will promote prosperity at home  and abroad also. Working with our Congress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan and administer foreign assistance  drastically reducing the bureaucracy that has built up around Government-based programmes  streamlining our delivery systems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic reform. The Agency for International Development (AID)  another institution born during the cold war  needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. Promoting economic security  opportunity and competitiveness will become a primary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be charity. On the contrary  they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore  using existing foreign-affairs resources  I will propose creating a $1 billion growth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United States businesses in providing expertise  goods and services desperately needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring. I will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the Export-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology promote investment in world-wide economic growth. The United States will work with its global partners  especially the G-7 nations  to enhance global growth at this key point in world history  as we end one era and begin another. None of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute  through greater coordinated action  to building ¬£ stronger world economy. I realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we live in remarkable times: times when empires collapse  ideologies dissolve and walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget how far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global community of democratic nations. And in the face of today's changes  with the loss of so much that was familiar and predictable  there is now a great temptation for people everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against trade  walls against people  walls against ideas and investment  walls against anything at all that appears new and different. As the Berlin Wall fell  these walls too must fall. They must fall because we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so interconnected  our security so intertwined  our prosperity so interdependent  that to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and defeat. At the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful  more secure  more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children and our grandchildren  for the sake of those who perished during the cold war and for the sake of every man  woman and child who kept freedom's flame alive even during the darkest noon  let us pledge ourselves to make that future real  and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United Nations. Thank you and may God bless you all. "
"161",7268,"UZB",47,1992,"Let me most cordially join in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. For the first time  the delegation of the Republic of Uzbekistan is taking part in the work of the United Nations General Assembly as an independent State. It is an honour for us to express our sincere gratitude to all State Members of the United Nations for the support and cooperation they have given the young independent Republic of Uzbekistan. We are very grateful to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali  for his constant attention to our region. The decision to open at Tashkent an office representing the United Nations and a number of its specialized organizations is clear evidence of that attention. This approach arises from the main orientation of United Nations activities at the present time  which were formulated in concentrated form by the Secretary-General in his report ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). Recently the people of Uzbekistan solemnly marked the first anniversary of its independence. The fact that now we have begun building an independent State is the logical result of the constant and selfless struggle for independence waged over the centuries by our people and its best sons. Achieving independence has never been easy anywhere in the world. For that reason our year of independence is only the beginning of a long process. We are laying the groundwork for an independent Uzbek State. We have saved our language  religion  traditions  customs and moral principles from the danger of complete disappearance; we are fully reincarnating our national values. Our natural resources  together with the economic  scientific  technical and moral potential built up by the labour of previous generations  can serve as a guarantee for the social and economic development of independent Uzbekistan. To turn this potential into a real force  our Republic  under the leadership of President Islam Karimov  is working out an appropriate system; is looking for the best structure of governmental administration and for  ways to develop the economy and to construct its foreign and domestic policies. Measures are being taken for the social protection of the population against the shocks that are inevitable in the transition to a market economy  to a society which is new to us. In the process of building an independent State  we are utilizing the positive experience accumulated by other developed nations and based on openness and market relations. Of course  in so doing we are taking into consideration  first and foremost  the specific features and concrete circumstances of our country and the national and cultural traditions of the people who live there. We seek to create a social and political structure under which the principles of human rights and freedom will be strictly observed. Our State policy is designed to protect the interests and rights of all peoples  irrespective of their nationalities  religion or beliefs  to preserve and develop their cultures  languages  national traditions and customs and to involve them actively in State and public life. We have firmly rejected the domination of any one ideology or any one world view; in fact  we are establishing a multiparty system as an essential and logical element of genuine democracy.  At the same time  we are outlawing those forces and movements that attempt through blackmail  threats and violence to change the structure of the State  that endanger the territorial integrity and security of our Republic  that sow ethnic and religious dissension  that encroach on the constitutional system and the moral foundations of our people's life. We require the activities of all forces and movements to remain within the limits of the law. In our economic policy  we reject the structure based on the command administration system  which is highly centralized and distributive. We completely reject ideology. Equal rights apply to all types of property. Of course  there are difficulties being encountered in carrying out our political and economic programmes. This is something we all recognize. Today our people is going through a difficult period of transition. This is due to the fact that for many years our republic was the victim of a policy of repression and diktat  resulting in a dependent economy and making our region a raw-materials appendage. It is not easy to rescue our people from the consequences of the totalitarian hegemony of communist ideas. Certainly  a new and just society cannot be created in a day  or even in a year. We understand all this clearly. The most important thing is that  on the basis of inter-ethnic accord and unity among our citizens  we have established a stable social and political situation in our country. The peoples of our region. Central Asia - Uzbeks  Kazakhs  Turkmans  Kyrgyzes and Tajiks - are the children of common forefathers. We share the same land and water  the same religion  the same history and the same fate; we share the same cares  joys and anxieties. Historically  we have always been naturally connected and interdependent. We created our common history through cooperation. Many of our internal problems are evolving; they could easily become inter-ethnic or international problems  affecting the interests of the peoples of our region. This is what is special about the general situation and the international position of Uzbekistan and of Central Asia as a whole. At present the Government and the people of Uzbekistan are deeply concerned about the course of events in Tajikistan  which is on the brink of civil war. The serious international danger is that armed clashes between the opposing forces  which have claimed thousands of lives among the peaceful population  could easily spread to neighbouring Central Asian States. In the Central Asian region  with its dense population of over 50 million  such an armed conflict could have unpredictable consequences. Should the conflict spread  the peoples of Central Asia could be involved in an endless fratricidal war  which could ultimately destroy the freedom and independence they have recently won. That is why the current situation is dangerous for us. We have every reason to be concerned. In practice  the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan  where there are hundreds of thousands of men under arms  remains open. The actions of extremists and fanatical armed groups incited by those who are playing on people's national and religious feelings could have unpredictable consequences. Uzbekistan strongly opposes interference in the internal affairs of independent Tajikistan and is against stirring up the fire of war. Uzbekistan advocates preventing the spread of the armed conflict and finding a solution as quickly as possible by peaceful and civilized means. Uzbekistan supports the appeal of the Government of Tajikistan to the United Nations to provide assistance in finding a solution to the grave crisis  which could become international in scope. Uzbekistan regards as decisive in the present circumstances the role of the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Fully aware of the danger of the situation  and in a spirit of humanity  and  at the same time  of responsibility for the fate of our peoples  Uzbekistan has requested Secretary-General  Boutros Boutros-Ghali  to examine the situation and inform the Security Council  and various United Nations committees and commissions  of our concern. The President of the Republic of Uzbekistan  Islam Karimov  in his letter addressed to Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali  stressed that only timely and effective assistance by the international community can be decisive in supporting the process of democratization and the political and economic reforms under way in the new independent States of the region. In proposing this initiative  Uzbekistan proceeds from the concept that the predominant idea of the new international order should be the prevention of aggression and conflicts and the establishment of democratic machinery for making such an order a reality. That concept was convincingly expounded as preventive diplomacy by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In our view the guarantee for such preventive action can be found in cooperation in the broad sense of the term. I think that what I have said is sufficient for an understanding of the need to create a United Nations Eastern Centre in our region with the aim of extending the principles of the world community and international norms to the central part of the Eurasian continent. I believe that Tashkent  as a historic centre of that region  with its rich past and its modern experience in peacemaking activities  would be fully worthy of the honour of serving as the seat of the Eastern Centre. That would provide the world community with reliable information on the processes of social development in the region  expedite the solution of its problems and make it a zone free of conflicts. In our view  that is the main goal of the United Nations and the new world order. "
"162",7313,"VCT",47,1992,"I should like to begin by offering to Mr. Ganev my heartfelt congratulations on his assumption of the high office of President of the General Assembly. He takes up the presidency at a time when the world is looking with renewed confidence towards the United Nations. As a politician from an area with a proud tradition of representative democracy  he has played a commendable role in the vanguard of the democratization process in his own country and in Eastern Europe. His unanimous election as President of the General Assembly for the current session highlights the continuing efforts of his region in its transformation to market-driven  democratic societies and the global prerogatives of the post-cold-war era. I am sure that his experience  training and diplomatic skill will do much to ensure that the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly is fruitful and constructive. Let me also take this opportunity to extend to his predecessor  Mr. Samir S. Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  our best wishes and our appreciation of the highly competent manner in which he presided at the last session of the General Assembly. I take this opportunity also to express to our esteemed Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  our profound understanding and appreciation of the efforts he has so far made to achieve for the world body greater flexibility and enhanced ability to meet the new challenges posed by the dramatic developments taking place in international relations and  at the same  to fulfil long-standing mandates. On behalf of the Government and the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  I pay tribute to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar  whose term of office expired at the end of 1991. Under his guidance over a 10-year period  the United Nations shrugged off the negative image of a useless talking-shop and emerged as an institution whose growing reputation as an effective peace-keeper has resulted in calls upon it to take on numerous new responsibilities. Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar did indeed ease the transition of the United Nations through the changing climate and brought it to the centre of new-world-order politics. He brought the Organization  with its new peace-keeping and peacemaking roles  back to its founding mission. We join the international community in saluting him for his service to the United Nations and to world peace. This year the General Assembly has so far admitted 13 States to membership of the United Nations by acclamation. My delegation wishes to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to Armenia  Azerbaijan  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Croatia  Georgia  Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  the Republic of Moldova  San Marino  Slovenia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The admission of this significant number of new Members in the Organization is another major step towards the goal of universality. My delegation wishes to express its deepest sympathy to the Governments and the peoples of the United States of America  the Bahamas  the Philippines  Nicaragua  India and Pakistan  which suffered tragic loss of life and extensive material damage as a result of the recent spate of natural disasters. We pray that our own Caribbean region will be spared any more destruction during this hurricane season. It is our hope that the rehabilitation process in the affected communities will be swift and will receive the generous support of the international community. In the last few years we have witnessed momentous changes in the international arena. The end of the cold war has raised hopes for a better and more secure future. The world now faces novel challenges in the quest for justice  equity and prosperity. In many regions of the world significant progress has been made towards democracy  as well as towards achieving the purposes set out in the United Nations Charter. Completion of the process of dismantling apartheid would make a major contribution to these trends. However  while there has been positive movement towards the establishment of a united  non-racial and democratic South Africa  we are perturbed by some serious differences that have emerged in recent negotiations. My delegation wishes to express its full support for the call by the African National Congress for an international investigation of the Boipatong massacre. We urge all concerned to make every effort to maintain the momentum of the negotiating process of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa in order to finalize agreement on the outstanding issues. If negative trends in South Africa are not reversed my Government stands ready to join in remobilizing the international community  through all appropriate means  in the struggle against apartheid. We wish to encourage President De Klerk to continue the courageous leadership that he has so far given his Government and urge him not to undermine the historic image that both he and Nelson Mandela have established. My delegation has been following the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina  which has shocked the conscience of every human being  irrespective of national origin  ethnic background  religion or political persuasion. We condemn the existence of detention centres  especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina  where civilians are being detained against their will and subjected to ill-treatment. The odious practice of ""ethnic cleansing"" must be firmly rejected and a strong signal sent that the international community will not passively witness the attempt at the total annihilation of a Member State by a powerful neighbour. My delegation welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolutions 770 (1992) and 771 (1992)  which are designed to ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and that international organizations  in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross  have unimpeded access to concentration camps and detention centres. My delegation has been following with keen interest the negotiations on the issue conducted under the auspices of the European Community. We believe that this process must be accompanied by international efforts to put an immediate end to the violence and that increased pressure should be brought to bear on all parties concerned to work wholeheartedly for a political settlement. The cease-fire agreement which European and United Nations negotiators reached with warring factions in Bosnia is a step in the right direction. We are heartened by increased efforts to aid the long-suffering people of Somalia in the Horn of Africa. We continue to be concerned about the famine and the condition of human life in sub-Saharan Africa. My delegation implores the international community to pay the necessary attention to the plight of these people. We wish to draw attention to  and emphasize  the urgent need for policy reform that would make it possible to reduce drought through reforestation  and avoid famine created by wasteful military expenditure. My delegation welcomes the current peace efforts and prays for a just  comprehensive and lasting solution to the Middle East crisis  the core of which  in our opinion  is the question of Palestine. My delegation reiterates the importance of this issue and calls for the same consistency on the part of the United Nations that was so evident when the resolutions dealing with the invasion of Kuwait were before us. It is our hope that the ongoing peace process will result in a resolution of the conflict based on United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). My country firmly believes that the only durable solution to the historical conflict lies in the full recognition and establishment of the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and the corresponding right of the State of Israel to exist within secure and guaranteed borders. The definition and maintenance of secure borders at this time in world history has the benefit of modern technology  as the Gulf war has decisively shown. After a decade of mediation by the United Nations in the war over Cambodia  the historic signing of the Paris Peace Agreements by the warring factions on 23 October 1991 offers real hope for ending hostilities in that troubled country. We are  however  deeply concerned about the difficulties which are being encountered by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in the implementation of the Agreements. My delegation joins the call for all concerned parties to permit the deployment of all components of UNTAC in the areas under its control so that it can carry out its full function in implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreements. The situation in Haiti remains one of extreme concern to my country. We have already condemned  in no uncertain terms  the attempted illegal replacement of the constitutional President  the widespread use of violence  the coercion by the military  and the violation of human rights in that country. We feel that because of its critical involvement in the Haitian elections and its generic role as guarantor of international human rights  the United Nations has a special responsibility to the people of Haiti  who have never had the good fortune to enjoy the basic human rights and freedoms that the international community has agreed are fundamental to human dignity. The present situation calls for serious attention by the world body  working in tandem with the Organization of American States. Expressions of concern should be matched by concrete action. We share the anguish of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the forces of democracy  and join him in his impassioned call for action now. With regard to the political situation in Central America  my delegation welcomes the Peace Agreement on El Salvador  signed in January 1992 at Chapultepec. We wish to congratulate Colombia  Spain  Mexico and Venezuela on the very important role they played in the negotiating process. A profound debt of gratitude is also owed to Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar for his efforts in the service of peace in Central America  which are being continued by the new Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. My delegation is particularly pleased by recent developments in relations between the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the countries of Central America. The momentum generated by the convening and successful conclusion in January 1992 of the First Ministerial Conference between CARICOM and the countries of the Central American isthmus at San Pedro Sula in Honduras must be maintained. Guatemala's recognition of the independence of Belize and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries are positive and welcomed developments  facilitating the deepening of relations between member States of the Caribbean Community and the countries of Central America. The Caribbean region  and especially the countries of the Windward Islands  of which Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a part  have firmly committed themselves to structural adjustment and other economic reforms designed to increase their export earnings and competitiveness in the global economy. In the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States  we established free trade in 1988. In the wider CARICOM grouping  the 1984 Nassau Agreement on Structural Adjustment and the 1989 Grand Anse Declaration expressed the urgency which the regional leadership attaches to the transformation process. Even as we welcome recent hemispheric trade and investment initiatives aimed at enhancing the mobility of goods and services and creating greater opportunity for people  my country  as well as others in the Windward Islands grouping  is concerned that the vital economic interests of small States like ours are very marginal as the powerful developed countries of the world move to consolidate their markets in extensive trading blocs. In this regard the Governments and people of the four Windward Islands will redouble their efforts to ensure that powerful forces working in their own interest do not destroy our economies by prematurely reversing the marketing regime under which we sell our bananas to the countries of the European Economic Community. We expect the international community to understand that  with the best will and intention in the world  small  resource-impoverished islands like ours constitute a special case in economic development. Nothing has changed these circumstances. As the international order moves in the direction of free trade  my delegation expresses the strong conviction that special attention should be paid to traditional trading arrangements which have sustained economic growth and democracy in many parts of the world. In this regard we shall continue to work towards the maintenance of our traditional relationship with the European Community even as we make the transition towards eventual free trade. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  which brought together the largest gathering of world leaders ever in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil  from 3 to 14 June is now history. We must now translate 12 days of debates into positive action  or posterity will remember us for wasting a great opportunity to set the agenda for the preservation of our environment. As Chairman of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries during the month of July 1992  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines initiated action within the Group to coordinate the activities of member countries in follow-up action at the multilateral organizations as well as in the wider international community. My Government regards the agreement reached at the Rio Summit as an important start of a process that could eventually change the way the world approaches the challenge of fostering economic growth. We are particularly pleased that issues such as the sustainability of islands  the alleviation of poverty  the sustainable development of all types of forests  and the environmentally sound management of solid waste were addressed. My delegation urges the early ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity  which  it is felt  if honestly implemented could mitigate some of the hazards which small  island States like Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other low-lying coastal developing States face. My delegation takes note of the renewed commitment made by developed countries to achieve the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for development assistance to developing countries and  where this target has not yet been achieved  to augment their aid programmes in order to reach that target as soon as possible or by the year 2000. It is our hope that the recommended high-level commission on sustainable development will be established soon so that it can be convened as early as possible to ensure that follow-up action on the Rio Summit meets the hopes and aspirations of us all. Continuing progress towards democracy in many regions of the world  the obsolescence of the bipolar politics of the cold war  the overall reduction in military expenditure and the emergence of new States have elicited a positive response from the world community. The United Nations peacemaking and peace-keeping roles have increased and broadened considerably in the post-cold-war era. The world body is providing leadership in these and other vital areas. Unfortunately  demands for the same leadership in the field of social development have not been given the same degree of political importance. The Organization must address this issue as a matter of priority. It is true that significant efforts are being made at the national and international levels to improve the standards of living of the world's peoples but  globally  statistics show that there are today more poor people  more unemployed and greater social insecurity  especially among the populations of developing countries. Social development problems are global in scope and require global responses. To this end my Government supports the convening of a world summit for social development at the level of Heads of State or Government in early 1995 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. As man's inhumanity to man continues to manifest itself daily throughout the world  my Government remains mindful of its pledge to promote universal respect for  and observance of  human rights and fundamental freedoms in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. In furtherance of these goals  my Government will support the establishment of an effective international system for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of all peoples  irrespective of race  sex  language or religion. We hope that this can be achieved at the World Conference on Human Rights scheduled for Vienna in June 1993. My delegation is deeply concerned that our region has become a transshipment point for illicit drugs targeted at the North American and European markets. We recognize that drug trafficking is an international problem which affects the institutions and populations of different countries. My delegation wishes to reaffirm its commitment to increasing cooperation in fighting the global problem of drugs in all its aspects  be it illegal production  trafficking or consumption. This epidemic cannot be allowed to undermine our precious human resources. Accordingly  my Government will sign the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The world is poised on the threshold of a bold new experience in human history. The possibilities are tremendous but the challenges great. We in the English-speaking Caribbean  where democracy and constitutional order have long been institutionalized  are anxious to play our legitimate part  with full recognition of our condition and the requirements for global integration. We have been reliable allies in times of struggle and turbulence. We now look forward to sharing fairly in the dividends of a durable peace to which we have contributed by our stability and resolute commitment to liberty and democracy. "
"163",7360,"VEN",47,1992,"On behalf of Venezuela  I congratulate our President and the Government and people of Bulgaria on his election to preside over this session of the General Assembly. I welcome the new Member States  whose presence among us makes this Organization more universal. I also wish to place on record our gratitude to the Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia  Ambassador Samir Shihabi  who presided over the work of the forty-sixth session with such distinction. We are meeting at a time of particular instability and uncertainty. The international system is trying to find a new order and basic principles and guidelines to enable us to build a more just and egalitarian world. We are living at a time of rapid historical change. The most dramatic events and the most unexpected changes are taking place before a seemingly helpless world leadership. The end of communism is already a thing of the past; the collapse of the Soviet empire is ancient history. The absolute triumph of the West is beginning to be questioned  given the financial and exchange rate problems which the industrialized countries are experiencing  together with their profound social crisis. We might be talking about a post-capitalist era in which the quest for supposedly free competition has turned into a total dehumanization of the economic model  producing a yawning gap between rich and poor in world society. We are facing not the end of history  but rather a great lack of leadership  of confidence and of enthusiasm for the future. The industrialized countries  bogged down in their economic rivalries  cannot coordinate their actions in favour of peace  stability and justice. Deprived of the enemy which used to make them act together  they are now experiencing a substantial weakening of the bonds which used to unite them. The times in which we live require strong  democratic international organizations if the preventive diplomacy the Secretary-General has described in his ""Agenda for Peace"" which we are studying very carefully is to take root. We support the more active role he envisages for the Organization  in the area not of intervention  but rather of prevention. To achieve this  the United Nations and the specialized agencies must cooperate ""to address the deepest causes of conflict: economic despair  social injustice and political oppression."" (A/47/277  para. 15) The Security Council  which should have been the most efficient United Nations body  is an anachronism. It still reflects the interrelationship of forces that existed when it was created. When the United Nations came into being  its keystone was the Council  controlled by its five permanent members  which was given predominance to try to eliminate the limitations which had made the former League of Nations ineffectual. The founders of the Organization thought that this time the big Powers would be able to exercise effective leadership  in keeping with their power; that is  they would have the ability to act as world monitors and arbitrators and bring order to the world. To the frustration of humanity  the two super-Powers proved that they alone were enough to lay the foundations of international order. The Security Council  from the day the Organization was established until the end of the cold war  was to play second fiddle in the management of world affairs. After the collapse of the Soviet system  the Security Council began to regain its original functions. But it is doing so under the aegis of the triumphant values. Thus the major countries can outline an international scenario in accordance with their interests. This situation should be reconsidered so that  as the Secretary-General has said: ""Democracy within the family of nations means the application of its principles within the world Organization itself."" (A/47/277  para. 82) Before the General Assembly  the President of Venezuela  Carlos Andres Perez  clearly conveyed his concern over the need to make the Security Council more representative. He said: ""Our own people's aspiration to democracy can also become a permanent aspiration of the United Nations. The Organization will not be strengthened unless an agreement is reached to eliminate the right of veto exercised by the permanent members of the Security Council  a right that responded to circumstances and realities that have ceased to exist. This mechanism runs counter to the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and limits its effective contributions to collective security. ""The right to veto Security Council resolutions is a mechanism that limits the achievement of consensus among the Member States of the United Nations. The Security Council must be a representative body  and in no way should any of its members negate the majority view of the United Nations. If we want collective and democratic security  we must aspire to universal egalitarian law."" (A/46/PV.8. p. 13) In our changing times  concepts of State sovereignty and integrity are also being re-examined. Paradoxically  the ""champions of freedom""  once victorious  are trying to impose a homogeneous and intolerant world order in which an independent protagonist would be seen as a destabilizing and threatening factor. This is a matter of serious concern to the States of the southern hemisphere. In the past  we were important to the North in two ways: as the natural scenario for the East-West confrontation and as essential suppliers of raw materials. The confrontation between East and West is gone and with it the political and strategic usefulness of the third world. Raw materials have become marginal in the present world economy. The slump in the demand for commodities becomes more acute with every passing year. The phrase ""mobilizing effect"" used to mean that any surge in the rich economies would carry the developing economies along with it. When the North was growing  so were exports of raw materials. The situation has completely changed traditional export commodities no longer have the same value. International markets can almost do without us. The only way to preserve peace is to find balanced links between the hemispheres  put an end to relations of confrontation and strengthen cooperation between peoples. I have not come here to point out the mistakes made by the North. The countries in the South also bear heavy responsibilities. We must meet our challenge. The era of demagogic populism  inefficiency and corruption is over. If we wish to compete in a world of open markets we must devote ourselves to productive work and reward creativity. Venezuela has realized this and is in a position from which it can look to the future with optimism  provided there is compliance with the rules of open markets and competitiveness between nations. However  we must emphasize that while large regions in the South  especially in Latin America  are striving to internationalize their economies by opening them up to competition  the North is increasingly locking itself into inward-turning blocs. Ultimately  the free market one of the triumphant values to which I have already referred would seem to work in a single direction. If the rigid attitude of some international financial institutions persists  together with the dangerous protectionism that is again emerging among the industrialized countries  then the 1990s  which in Latin America began with severe economic measures and hopeful signs of growth  may also turn out to be another lost decade. The North is not making a contribution to the establishment of the necessary economic links between the two hemispheres. The new world order implies a dual concept: on the one hand  the failure of the South and  on the other  the defeat of the communist East. The power logic being applied is simple and direct. There is no longer any question of the loss of any given strategic resource or strategic position falling into the hands of communism. There being no enemies  there is no longer any danger of losing friends; worse yet  there is no longer any need for friends. What is important now is that there be no disorder and no anarchy. What matters now is the willingness of the South to submit to certain global rules of the game as defined by the North in terms of its own interests. Yet they fail to understand that these rules of the game become inoperative in situations ->f anarchy and civil strife  which can dismember a State and have spill-over effects on those surrounding it. Somalia is a tragic example of what the southern hemisphere could become  on a larger scale  in the twenty-first century. Some wealthy States may feel that they can live unaffected by such realities. They are mistaken. We must not forget that the South has its own ability to make an instinctive response: the migratory flows of its impoverished masses to the North. This flow  which is always difficult for any Government to control  could come to undermine the bases for the democratic and social stability in many developed countries. The best proof of this is the resurgence of extreme rightist movements and the outbreak of racial violence and xenophobia in many countries. These problems and the persistent imbalance between the North and the South highlight a series of essential issues that the Assembly should consider. The first is the democratization of the decision-making processes in the Security Council. This implies a new debate on the veto procedure and an increase in the number of permanent members so as to allow for the representation of the new world realities. The new circumstances in the world have been conducive to solving various regional problems  such as those in Angola  Namibia  Central America  Mozambique and Cambodia; to a large extent  in other areas  such as Afghanistan  Western Sahara  South Africa and the Middle East  there are signs  because of the new circumstances  that warrant hope for negotiated solutions to conflicts. Venezuela supports measures designed to achieve peaceful solutions to these problems and hopes that the favourable international climate will help maintain peace. We also supported the Rio summit on the environment and hope that the decisions adopted there  particularly those related to the problem of financing Agenda 21  will be implemented as soon as circumstances permit. ' Similarly  we give our full support to the Second World Conference on Human Rights  to be held next year  as well as to the forthcoming conferences on population and on the status of women and to the summit on social development. Despite the endeavours of the United Nations  the outlook is not encouraging. None the less  when all the countries gathered here in the Assembly commit themselves to working for change  for a world where hunger and war have vanished  where the environment is protected  and where realistic measures are adopted to prevent conflicts  then we shall be building the just society of which we have always dreamed.

"164",7399,"VNM",47,1992,"On behalf of the delegation of Viet Nam  permit me at the outset to extend my warmest congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria  on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. I am sure Mr. Ganev's guidance of this session of the General Assembly will make it a success. We also wish to express our appreciation for the outstanding contribution of His Excellency Mr. Samir S. Shihabi  President of the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session. We should also like to express our great appreciation of the untiring and dynamic efforts of by His Excellency Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  Secretary-General of the United Nations  in the noble cause of peace  security and cooperation among nations. On this occasion I cannot fail to convey warm greetings to the new Members of our great family  the United Nations. Since the last session of the General Assembly  we have continued to witness profound and far-reaching changes on a global scale. Those changes have led to the disintegration of the international order that came into being after the Second World War and that had existed for nearly half a century. The new world situation opens up new opportunities for but at the same time presents acute challenges to the peace  security and prosperity of each nation  as well as that of the international community as a whole. With the threat of annihilation by nuclear war receding and no longer hanging over the peoples of the world like the sword of Damocles  all nations might expect to live in a world of peace  security  justice and prosperity  with egalitarian  mutually beneficial cooperation and the joint application of the miraculous achievements of the modern scientific and technological revolution to the benefit of each country's and the whole world's development and well-being. Regrettably  the overall picture of today's world is far from being promising. We fully share the view expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries in the Jakarta Message of 6 September 1992: ""The world today is still far from being a peaceful  just and secure place. Simmering disputes  violent conflicts  aggression and foreign occupation  interference in the internal affairs of States  policies of hegemony and domination  ethnic strife  religious intolerance  new forms of racism and narrowly conceived nationalism are major and dangerous obstacles to harmonious coexistence among States."" Concurrently with the settlement of some regional conflicts  we have witnessed the outbreak of a series of new conflicts on several continents  even in the heart of Europe  a continent that should have enjoyed peace and stability thanks to the Helsinki mechanism of cooperation and security. In practice  policies of embargo  coercion and diktat are still being pursued by some countries or groups of countries against others  thus hindering the latter's development. The global economic environment also contains elements of uncertainty. The rate of economic growth has fallen to its lowest level in many years. The symptoms of a new financial crisis  which could shake the international monetary system  can be perceived. Tendencies towards greater protectionism and the deadlock in the Uruguay Round are only worsening the economic situation of many countries  especially the developing countries. Even more worrisome is the inexorably widening gap between the developed industrial countries and the developing countries. We cannot remain indifferent to the poverty and hunger suffered daily by millions of men and women across the continents. The famine in many countries  most severe in some African countries like Somalia and the Sudan  is deeply moving and calls for vast emergency assistance from other countries and from international organizations. In view of the above-mentioned opportunities and challenges  it is imperative for States and nations to step up cooperation to promote their own development and at the same time to join forces in solving global problems and in contributing to the building of a new  sounder and better world order based on truly democratic and egalitarian international relations  mutual respect and reciprocal benefit for the sake of the overall objectives of peace and development. In this regard  we welcome the initial results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio  especially Agenda 21  aiming at the goal of sustainable development. The immediate question  however  is that of securing the financial and technological resources needed to implement Agenda 21. The social dimension  including the concern for children  assumes the same long-term significance as regards both sustainable development and the environment. As is shown in the report of the Secretary-General  in the follow-up to the Plan of Action adopted by the World Summit for Children  much has been done in the past two years  but our commitment and our action need to be imbued with even greater universality. For its part  Viet Nam was the first country in Asia to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We have finalized our national programme of action and have just submitted  within the specified time-frame  our first national report on the implementation of the Convention. Against the backdrop of the evolving international situation  Asia and the Pacific reflect fairly clearly the characteristics of today's world. While several nations have seized opportunities to achieve rapid development  not a small number of others remain mired in a state of underdevelopment  deprivation and poverty. Alongside the trend towards cooperation  some seeds of potential conflicts are being sown. We are pleased to note that South-East Asia is now entering a new stage with fine prospects for peace and prosperity. The erstwhile complicated bilateral relations have been and are being normalized and the trend towards regional cooperation and integration  in order to achieve stability and development  is gaining great momentum. Relations of good-neighbourliness  mutual trust and understanding are gradually being established in the region. These are indeed historic developments in the international relations of South-East Asia  which had been a constant hotbed of war and tension for the past half century. However  as in many other areas in the world  there remain latent factors of destabilization  factors that are a legacy of the past or arise from recent events  especially those relating to territorial borders either on the land or on the sea  between the countries of South-East Asia and those near to them. This is a cause of concern for countries within and outside the region because of the danger of destabilization in that important part of the world. It is our view that global security is indivisible. This is true at the global as well as the regional level. Security can be achieved in South-East Asia only when security is assured for each country in the region  it being understood that such security is multifaceted: military  political and economic. To that end  various positive initiatives and proposals have been put forward by countries in the region  such as the Zone of Peace  Freedom and Neutrality in South-East Asia (ZOPFAN)  the Free Trade Area (AFTA) of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the ASEAN Manila Declaration of 22 July 1992  Malaysia's East Asian Economic Grouping (EAEG)  Indonesia's Forum on Cooperation in the Eastern (South China) Sea  and the seven principles governing relations among the countries of South-East Asia set forth by the Lao People's Democratic Republic. These proposals and initiatives have contributed  and are still contributing  to a large extent to the strengthening of mutual trust and understanding among nations in the region  thus fostering further regional cooperation. With regard to the problems that emerged recently over the Eastern Sea  it is our view that they should be solved appropriately through peaceful negotiations  without resort to force or the threat of force that is  on the basis of fundamental principles acceptable to all the parties concerned; otherwise  the situation may take a negative and complex turn. For Viet Nam's part  while firmly resolved to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity  we advocate the settlement of all disputes through dialogue between the parties concerned  so as to achieve an appropriate solution together. Pending such a solution  Viet Nam will exercise the utmost restraint and refrain from any action that might adversely affect efforts towards confidence-building and the relaxation of tension in the relations among countries of the region  and hopes that other parties concerned will do the same. We are convinced that with good will on the part of all parties concerned  an appropriate solution can be found to any dispute  no matter how complex it may be. In this spirit  we reiterate our full support for the four principles put forward in the ASEAN Declaration of 22 July 1992 to serve as a basis for the settlement of disputes and to ensure security in the Eastern Sea. These principles are as follows: First  all sovereignty and jurisdictional issues pertaining to the Eastern (South China) Sea shall be resolved by peaceful means  without resort to force; secondly  all parties concerned shall exercise restraint with a view to creating a positive climate for the eventual resolution of all disputes; thirdly  the possibilities of cooperation in the Eastern Sea shall be explored without prejudicing the sovereignty and jurisdiction of countries having direct interests in the area; and  fourthly  the principles contained in the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in South-East Asia shall be applied as the basis for establishing a code of international conduct over the Eastern Sea. Fruitful discussions in a spirit of constructive cooperation  based on equality and mutual respect between Viet Nam and  respectively  Malaysia  Indonesia and Thailand  on questions relating to the Eastern Sea  have proved to be the best way to settle problems in relations among countries of the region. The countries of the region and the international community support the implementation of the Paris Agreements on Cambodia  with a view to building a peaceful  independent and neutral Cambodia  living in national harmony  enjoying friendly relations with all countries and contributing to regional peace and stability. However  we share the international community's concern that the implementation of the Paris Agreements is being impeded and we call upon all the parties concerned to cooperate in order to ensure the strict and full implementation of these Agreements. For its part  as a signatory to the Paris Agreements  Viet Nam reaffirms its strict observance and full implementation of the provisions concerning Viet Nam  as stipulated by the Agreements. At the same time  Viet Nam denounces the acts of ostracism and persecution against Vietnamese residents in Cambodia and categorically rejects the slanderous allegations against Viet Nam by those whose only aim is to cover up their activities which undermine the Paris Agreements. The internationalization of the world economy and the trend towards economic restructuring require reform and resolute participation of national economies  including that of Viet Nam  in the international division of labour  economic cooperation and world trade. Over the last 5 years  thanks to the judicious policy pursued and the exceptional efforts exerted by the Vietnamese people  the cause of reform and renewal in Vietnam has effectively become part of everyday life and brought about initial but very significant achievements in all spheres of social life. The energies of all economic sectors in our country have been released and multiplied. Together with the expansion of cooperation with the outside world  such developments have brought about visible changes in the economic and social make-up of the country which is thus poised to forge ahead. Life however always poses new demands. While carrying out the task of economic reform as the centrepiece of our efforts we are at the same time stepping up political reform and renewal. These are the two facets of one single process which interact and stimulate each other. The political reform is aimed at extending the democratic freedoms of our citizens in all respects  restructuring the political system and building a State governed by the rule of law  truly of the people  by the people and for the people. Our new Constitution  promulgated in April this year  is not only a concrete embodiment but also the institutionalization of this reform process. One of the essential elements of this new Constitution is to ensure strict respect for the fundamental rights of the citizen. Proceeding from the great principles enshrined in Viet Nam's 1945 Declaration of Independence  whereby ""all peoples of the world are born equal; every nation is entitled to the same rights to life  happiness and freedom""  we hold the view that each State and each nation strives for the ideal of democracy and freedom in its own way  creatively rather than through a stereotyped or dogmatic approach  and still less through the adoption of models imposed from outside. Each nation is entitled to the sacred right freely to choose its own socio-political system  to chart its own path of development and to tackle its own problems in accordance with its historical  cultural and social traditions. It is unacceptable for one nation to impose standards of democracy and human rights upon another nation  and it is all the more unacceptable for one nation to stand as judge over another nation. Carrying out its foreign policy of broad openness  diversification and greater multilateral emphasis in its international relations  during recent times Viet Nam has strengthened and expanded its relations with many countries in the world on the bases of mutual respect for each other's independence  sovereignty and territorial integrity  of non-interference in each other's internal affairs  and of equality and mutual benefit. We attach special importance to improving and strengthening relations of friendship and cooperation with countries in our region and to making a positive contribution towards a South-East Asia of peace  stability  cooperation and development. Relations between Viet Nam and the countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have entered a completely new phase. Our country's accession to the Treaty on Amity and Cooperation in South-East Asia  signed at Bali in 1976  and its becoming an observer in ASEAN constitute the foundation for a qualitatively new development of the relations of friendship and cooperation between Viet Nam and the ASEAN countries. Relations between Viet Nam and China have been normalized on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence  in keeping with the aspiration and interests of the two peoples and with the trend towards peace  stability and development in the region. We believe that these fundamental interests will help the two countries settle in a satisfactory manner and through peaceful negotiations outstanding as well as newly emerging problems in their relations on the basis of respect for each other's independence  sovereignty and legitimate interests. Our foreign policy is geared to combining continuity and dynamism in our relations with all countries  large and small. We are doing our utmost to consolidate and renew traditional relations with friendly countries and with countries members of the Non-Aligned Movement  and we continue to extend solidarity and support to the cause of the Palestinian and South African peoples and to all other peoples struggling for peace  national independence  democracy and social progress. We continue to strengthen existing relations with countries in various continents and at the same time enter into relations with countries in regions with which we have had only rare contacts in the past  such as recently with countries in the South Pacific  the Gulf and Latin America. The normalization of relations between Viet Nam and the United States will benefit not only the Vietnamese and the American peoples but also peace and stability in South East Asia. We have turned the page on past history and look forward to the future. Proceeding from this spirit and from our humanitarian policy  we have done whatever possible in cooperating effectively with the United States to settle the question of Americans missing in action during the Viet Nam war. Our constructive efforts and goodwill have been welcomed by the American public and acknowledged by the United States Administration. We are of the view that today multilateralism  especially as embodied by the United Nations  occupies an increasingly significant position. However  we should define the appropriate degree of separation and correlation between the multilateral dimension and the national dimension. It should be emphasized that isolationism is outmoded but national sovereignty forever remains a sacred value  which all countries  large and small  are determined to defend. World developments over the past year have rendered ever more imperative the demand for the democratization of international life and inter-State relations  including the democratization of multilateral forums  especially the United Nations. In the new context  the composition of the Security Council and the balance between the Council  the General Assembly and the Secretary-General of the United Nations must reflect the realities of a world which has radically changed as compared with the time when the United Nations was born  and even with only a few years ago. We endorse the idea of re-examining and enlarging the composition of the Security Council  with due attention to developing countries  with a view to fully implementing the principle of equality between all Member States and ensuring that the voice of the majority is duly heard in the process of making decisions on issues of critical importance to the international community. Our world body must be revitalized so that it can really be an effective multilateral tool for keeping and safeguarding peace  contributing to the solution of global issues and especially for building a sounder and more equitable new world order that will be the fruit of our truly common endeavour. Within its foreign policy of sovereign independence  peace  cooperation and openness  Vietnam will do its best to participate actively in the work of multilateral institutions and forums  thereby to promote further its integration into the international community and the world economy and to contribute to shaping a sound and equitable new world order that really meets the legitimate expectations of the community of nations.

"165",7433,"VUT",47,1992," I join in the congratulations extended to you. Sir  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session. Your election symbolizes the great changes taking place throughout the world  and is a tribute to your country and to your people  as well as to you yourself. I should also like to pay a special tribute to you your predecessor  Mr. Samir Shihabi  the former Permanent Representative of Saudi Arabia  for the manner in which he presided over the affairs of the General Assembly during its forty-sixth session. There can be no doubt that there has been no period in our lifetime when the world has enjoyed greater hope for a lasting international peace than it does now. The gradual reduction of tension and the eventual elimination of antagonisms between the world's two foremost military Powers have had dramatic results in nuclear disarmament  and ultimately contributed to the end of the cold war. Today  the widening circle of democracy holds out the promise of an international environment that could become even more conducive to the attainment of international peace and security. None the less  many problems persist and plague the Earth  threatening our never-ending search for justice  equality and peace. Democracy  so cherished and championed  within certain national borders  is often less cherished  if not disregarded  when it comes to the interests of the large and powerful countries  on the one hand  and those of the smaller and economically weaker States  on the other. Moreover  nationalism  which could  and should  be a progressive vehicle for unifying peoples  rather than dividing them  has on occasion been encouraged to manifest its narrowest and most intolerant forms. In too many parts of the world  old ethnic antagonisms have been reawakened and are being exploited by demagogues who are very adept at using these antagonisms to serve their selfish and short-sighted ambitions. Unfortunately  far too often the victims of this demagoguery have no recourse to any legal mechanism that might spare their lives and end their suffering. Tragically  we have seen certain scenarios played out far too often. At first  the world sits idly by and barely notices the insulting words and the offensive speeches that are made. Then  even more inflammatory rhetoric is spouted  and eventually stones are hurled. Next  individuals are assaulted in the streets and their homes are invaded and vandalized. Before too long  conditions deteriorate irreparably. For some  that constitutes a point of no return. Ignorance  which breeds hatred  accelerates and races forward unchecked  building its own momentum with ever-increasing destructive force. Entire neighbourhoods or villages are placed under siege. The demagogues  by now totally intoxicated by the false power of the forces they have unleashed  will always try to claim to be defending the loftiest ideals. In fact  they are simply following their basest instincts. Vanuatu has long been disturbed by the hesitancy and reluctance of some members of the international community to address this very troublesome issue. In the past we have warned that failure to examine the causes of ethnic antagonisms or intercommunal conflicts  failure to devise peaceful ways to resolve them  could only lead to a situation in which  one day  international peace and security would be quite seriously threatened by such developments. Regrettably  that day has now arrived. Thus  while some of us have never had more reason to rejoice and others have never had more reason to mourn  still others have never faced a less certain future. What possible joy can a mother in the Balkans feel when she buries her young son whose life was ended by an unknown sniper's bullet? What possible joy can a father in Somalia feel when he watches his daughter die a slow and painful death from starvation? What can possibly ease the terror that fills the hearts of defenceless and innocent refugees who find themselves caught in the vice of political and social indifference or who behold the chaos in native lands they had always considered havens of justice and equality. While some rightly rejoice over the end of the cold war and the spread of democracy  others are homeless and continue to suffer the pangs of hunger often the result of economic deprivation. Still others mourn the sudden and violent end of the lives of their loved ones and wonder anxiously whether they themselves will survive to see the next sunrise. While some are able to applaud what has been achieved  others can only contemplate the long road still to be travelled. From South Africa to Afghanistan  from Cambodia to Haiti  from Bosnia and Herzegovina to East Timor  from the heart of Europe all the way to the sunny South Pacific  people are suffering some for a long time now because of the difficulties of all kinds that they face  and the international community must still shoulder the major responsibility. All these ideas are emphasized in the Secretary-General's remarkable report entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"". He has made a thought-provoking analysis  and we find this document to be a very good starting-point for much-needed discussions as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and as mankind prepares to enter the twenty-first century. The international political environment is not the only environment that concerns us. Much has been written and much has been said about the Earth Summit held this past June in Rio de Janeiro  Brazil. It remains to be seen what will be done as a follow-up to that very important meeting. We are pleased to note that some very positive measures have already been taken. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is to be commended for having made a significant financial contribution to Capacity 21. Canada has indicated that it will follow suit. We trust that others also will do so very soon. This important initiative will help the developing countries formulate national policies and legislation in support of the environment and sustainable development. It will focus on the technical training of human resources and the strengthening of regional and national institutions. More importantly  it will show how serious the developed countries of the North are about the extensive multilateral commitments necessary to breathe life into our post-Rio journey. At this session of the General Assembly a number of important measures should be taken as follow-ups to the Earth Summit. Among these  of course  is the establishment of a high-level commission on sustainable development. It is our hope that the commission's secretariat will be situated at United Nations Headquarters here in New York and that the commission will meet in New York so that all countries will have an opportunity to participate in  and contribute to  the commission's important work. Situating the commission's secretariat elsewhere and holding its meetings outside New York would without any doubt result in sharply reduced participation by a large number of developing countries and would limit the commission's effectiveness. Furthermore  we feel that situating the commission in New York would be most cost-effective for the United Nations and would stimulate the very necessary interaction between the commission  UNDP  the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)  the World Bank and the other multilateral agencies that are so essential to making the follow-up to Rio meaningful and effective. We strongly believe  as do our colleagues in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)  that the decisions made with respect to the site of the commission's secretariat  the venue of its meetings  its size and its composition will be critical in determining whether there will be universal participation and transparency in the work of the commission. Our major concern is that this matter not be decided on any ground except what is likely to lead to the most effective functioning of the commission and its productive interaction with other agencies. During the current session of the General Assembly  an intergovernmental committee to negotiate a convention on drought and desertification will also be established. Vanuatu intends to participate actively in that committee's work and to lend its support to those countries most immediately threatened by drought and desertification. We feel that addressing this problem is one of the greatest challenges facing the international community. Another of the very important measures the General Assembly will consider as a follow-up to the Earth Summit is the proposal to hold a world conference on the sustainable development of the small island States. Such a meeting is long overdue. We hope a resolution on convening the conference will be adopted by consensus and that the essential objective of the conference  which AOSIS is proposing be held in Barbados  will be to ensure concrete and meaningful action by the international community to assist the world's most vulnerable  yet very frequently overlooked  countries. We appeal to all countries to lend their support to this conference and to join us in the warm and friendly atmosphere of Barbados next June in order to continue our journey together on the road charted by the Rio Conference. Vanuatu is not only a small island State but also a least developed country. We therefore have a real concern for our economy as well as for political democracy. Thus  we aspire also to economic development. Therefore  we join in the appeals for measures to correct the trade imbalances  to reduce the debt burden  and to establish fair prices for our commodities. We believe that measures must be taken to overcome these scourges of underdevelopment. This subject is of such great importance that we approach the question of the reform and restructuring of the United Nations development system with a great deal of hope that creative approaches will be devised and effectively utilized in the post-cold-war period. We are pleased and proud to report that next month our Parliament in Vanuatu will act on legislation required for the ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  and the Convention on Biological Diversity. We strongly feel it is essential that these conventions be ratified  enter into force and be strictly adhered to at the earliest possible moment. We are also pleased that there is finally a convention banning chemical weapons. We pray that those who possess such weapons and those who would possess them will see the wisdom of becoming parties to that legal instrument and forever banning those horrible tools of death. Environmental disasters that have recently struck countries as diverse and geographically distant from each other as the Bahamas  France  Nicaragua  Pakistan and the United States suggest that the world has not a moment to spare if we are to avoid the potential global calamity that could result from mankind's long-term abuse of the environment. Precautionary  preventive measures should be taken now; otherwise it will most assuredly be too late. For decades  the peoples of the South Pacific have seen their region utilized for the testing of nuclear weapons  for the dumping of radioactive wastes and  most recently  for the destruction of chemical weapons. Our region paid high and unwanted costs for technologies from which we received comparatively little benefit. Today  we South Pacific leaders are very concerned about plans to ship plutonium through our waters. We trust that those who are involved in these plans will heed our voices while we still have voices to be heard. I conclude by joining in the welcome that has been expressed to all of our new Members. Theirs has not been an easy path to statehood  international recognition and membership of the United Nations. We salute their perseverance and their vision of their own futures. We stand ready to join hands with them in forging a more effective  more representative and more responsive United Nations. In that way we shall help to create a more democratic international order a world order that is democratic in fact as well as in word; a world order that respects all countries  whether large and powerful or small and vulnerable."
"166",7508,"YEM",47,1992,"It is an honour for me to extend to you. Sir  my sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish you every success in your high post. I also take this opportunity to extend to Ambassador Samir Shihabi  through you  our deepest appreciation of the great role he played during his outstanding presidency of the forty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I also take the opportunity to commend the outstanding and significant role of Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  the Secretary-General of the United Nations  in promoting the effectiveness of the United Nations through the implementation of the principles and purposes of the Charter. More than two years have passed since the establishment of the Republic of Yemen. This national historic achievement has been one of the most important world events of the beginning of this decade which abounds with great changes. The dream of the Yemeni people has become an actual reality thanks to their deep belief in the inevitability of unity and their persistent struggle to achieve that unity. The Yemeni people have earned the admiration of the world through the realization of their unity by peaceful and democratic means. The Constitution of the Republic of Yemen emphasizes the commitment of the country to the principles of democracy. It enshrines the right of all Yemeni citizens fully to enjoy their principal freedoms  including the freedom of expression  in every way. It also stipulates respect for their legal and constitutional rights  such as the right to unrestricted unionist and political action. The Republic of Yemen  from its very inception  has enjoyed the benefits of an active participation in political life by a society that  having evolved through a multiplicity of political parties  associations and people's organizations  recognizes the importance of diversity and the exchange of opinions and ideas. Yemen in its new era is about to end the transitional period and is now on the threshold of another  more promising  stage. It will hold the first elections throughout the country in which all Yemeni people  men and women  will cast their votes and elect the members of the new House of Representatives in accordance with the Constitution. In the face of all these historic  vital changes  Yemen is confronted by a number of challenges which include certain economic difficulties that have resulted from the return  because of the Gulf crisis and for other reasons  of more than a million expatriates who used to work in neighbouring sisterly countries. On the other hand  parts of Yemen have suffered destructive floods and violent earth tremors in the middle region. In addition  these are the burdens of providing shelter and sustenance to thousands of our brethren  refugees from sisterly Somalia. Following the proclamation of the Republic of Yemen  my country declared that Yemeni unity was not intended to be set against the interests of any State in the region  especially those of neighbouring States and that it was proclaimed to contribute to the strengthening of security  stability  cooperation and integration in our region. In confirmation of all this the Yemeni House of Representatives approved the first statement of the Government of Unity  which emphasized the willingness of Yemen  for the first time  to start negotiations concerning its borders with neighbouring sister countries according to historical and legal rights and the principles of international law. In this context  negotiations between Yemen and the sisterly Sultanate of Oman concerning borders have reached their final stage. On the question of the borders between Yemen and Saudi Arabia  my country reiterated its willingness to consider this question and to discuss it with the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The initiative of President Ali Abdullah Saleh  Chairman of the Presidential Council  in which he called upon our brethren in Saudi Arabia to initiate face-to-face meetings on the question of borders according to historical and legal rights  has had its positive impact. Our brethren in Saudi Arabia have responded to the initiative of the Yemeni leadership. The first preparatory ministerial meeting between the two parties was held in Geneva on 20 July last. During that meeting  proposals were exchanged concerning the holding of the second meeting in one of the two capitals  either Sanaa or Riyadh. It has been agreed to hold the second meeting at the level of a committee of experts in the city of Riyadh later this month. This demonstrates Yemen's determination  in its new era  to translate words into actions and to reaffirm  on a practical level  that it seeks to strengthen security and stability  and calls for regional and bilateral cooperation between the countries of the Arab peninsula.  The world hears and witnesses on TV screens the human tragedy experienced by the brotherly Somali people. Hundreds of men  women and particularly children die daily in a cruel and sad manner. Thousands of them die of hunger  and thousands of internecine strife. Thousands of Somalis flee the country daily to escape this hellish  devastating war and to seek their livelihood. The steps taken by the Security Council to help the people of Somalia out of their plight have come a bit late. We call for the intensification of international efforts to urgently provide the necessary humanitarian assistance and ensure its delivery to all the Somali people who face death in every part of the country. In this connection  Yemen commends the leading role played by the Secretary-General  Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  in focusing attention on this tragedy  which the international community almost lost sight of in the maelstrom of the many crises buffeting the world. While we commend the recent increasing efforts by the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations to help the Somali people out of their plight  we call for addressing the root causes of that tragedy. Hence  the United Nations is called upon to adopt practical measures in cooperation with the League of Arab States  the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Organization of the Islamic Conference  to search for a political solution to the Somali crisis. Without this  all the world's humanitarian efforts will be no more than palliatives. Yemen has participated in the efforts made in the framework of the Somali National Reconciliation Conference  held in Djibouti last year under the auspices of President Hassan Gouled. Unfortunately  however  the national power groups in Somalia have failed to implement the resolutions adopted at that conference. Therefore  we appeal to the international community to make another attempt to contain the Somali crisis and to arrive at a definitive solution to the conflict. In this connection  I should like to reiterate Yemen's willingness to participate anew in any efforts that may be deployed   hopefully in the very near future  to hold another conference for national reconciliation in Somalia and to ensure its success. The plight of Somalia has exceeded all bounds. Let us all hasten to save Somalia from disintegration and fragmentation and to save the Somali people from suffering and misery. When we speak of human suffering  we must mention the bloody events in Bosnia and Herzegovina  where the people are subjected to acts of murder  destruction and displacement at the hands of the Serbian forces  which have adopted the heinous policy of ""ethnic cleansing"". Those forces have persisted in their acts of aggression. They continue to incarcerate thousands of people from Bosnia and Herzegovina - men  women  even the elderly - in concentration camps  in a frightening repeat of horrible Nazi practices. We join the rest of the world's countries in calling for an end to these acts of aggression  which are supported by Belgrade. We also support firmly all the steps and measures adopted by the Security Council with a view to putting an end to these atrocious massacres and restoring peace to the Balkans. The human tragedies that beset this or that nation and overwhelm this or that people are manifestations of political crises that deteriorate to the level of military confrontation and armed conflict. No matter how varied the causes and motives of such crises may be and regardless of their differing circumstances  they tend to have one thing in common: namely that it is the innocent civilians and especially the most vulnerable among them  who pay the price and bear the brunt of the blunders of others. Invariably  they become the victims of conflicts and wars without reason or justification  and without mercy. This is the case with regard to the brotherly people of Iraq  whom the international community seems to have forgotten after having imposed on them one of the most cruel and intensive forms of comprehensive economic embargo ever an embargo that has deprived them of all the requirements of civilian life  including those of children and medical care. The Republic of Yemen calls upon the international community to lift the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. On another level  Yemen has voiced its concern over the actions taken to prevent Iraqi aircraft from flying beyond latitude 32 to the south of Iraq under the pretext of protecting the Shiites. We are certainly against any arbitrary actions or violations of the human rights of any group of people. But we are also against intervention or interference in the internal affairs of any sovereign State. The segmentation of the sovereignty of the State of Iraq over its territories in the north and the south  in our opinion is not consonant  with the principle of respect for the sovereignty of States. It could lead to the fragmentation of the territorial integrity of Iraq. These days  bilateral negotiations continue between the Arab delegations and the Israeli delegation in Washington in pursuance of the peace process  which is designed to establish a just and durable peace in the Middle East under the auspices of the United States of America and the Russian Federation. The Republic of Yemen  which has previously expressed its support for the efforts made by the United States of America and the Russian Federation to push forward the  peace process in the Middle East through the peace conference  expresses its belief that the ongoing negotiations will not be successful unless they proceed from a commitment to adhere to the principle of land for peace  according to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and unless Israel agrees to withdraw from all occupied territories and to renounce completely the policy of expansion and settlement  especially in eastern Jerusalem. This must include the halting of settlement building  whether they are called political or security settlements as well as the recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination  including the right to sovereignty and independence. At the beginning of this month  the Summit Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement successfully concluded its work. The United Nations has been the focus of special interest in the summit meeting. This is not surprising. The United Nations has regained its rightful place in the heart of the international community after having been threatened with marginalization and atrophy. Its role has been strengthened in forging and coordinating international relations in all aspects of life. The Security Council has started to exercise its powers in maintaining international peace and security after several years of inertia. After discussing the situation of the United Nations and its renewed role in the light of new ideas and proposals  including the ""Agenda for Peace"" submitted by the Secretary-General  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  and his important address to the conference  the Conference in Jakarta emphasized the importance of the United Nations as the main international forum for the activity of the Non-Aligned Movement. It also called for the participation of the Movement in the formulation of new international relations  as it embodies and represents the interests and aspirations of the developing countries  which constitute the majority of Members of the United Nations. In this context  we welcome the fact that the valuable proposals included in the ""Agenda for Peace"" will be discussed not only in the Security Council but also in the General Assembly as the issue of peace in all its aspects is of interest to all the countries and peoples of the world. As for the international economic situation  the meeting in Jakarta noted that  despite the positive changes in the area of international relations  the economic situation of the developing countries has deteriorated further and that  consequently  the United Nations must continue to promote cooperation between the developing countries and the industrialized countries in a manner that may serve the interests of economic integration in an equitable and increasing context. The Rio conference contributed to informing the world of the need for a process of sustainable development  so that future generations may not be exposed to danger. Therefore  the international community is called upon to implement the international agreements approved by the Conference on Environment and Development  particularly Agenda 21  which will help to promote international cooperation. The Charter of the United Nations will remain the meeting-point and symbol of concord between the countries of the world  large and small. It will also continue to represent the most ideal framework for coordination of international relations in a manner that promotes international peace and security. Today  and after the removal of the restrictions that hindered the use of machinery provided for in the Charter - such as the use of force we need  more than ever  the strictest respect for the Charter to avoid its adaptation  or interpretation of its provisions  for the purpose of serving the narrow national interests of any one party. For all that  it is imperative that the foundations of democratic dealings in international relations be deepened and that balance and interaction between the main organs of the United Nations namely  the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Secretariat be ensured. Balance expresses the very spirit of the Charter. "
"167",7653,"ZWE",47,1992,"I should like  at the outset to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Stoyan Ganev  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Bulgaria  on his unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its the forty-seventh session. His election is recognition of his diplomatic skills and the respect for international law in his country. We are confident that the international community will benefit from his presidency. I also take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to his predecessor. His Excellency Ambassador Samir Shihabi of Saudi Arabia  who diligently presided over the General Assembly at its forty-sixth session in an exemplary manner. We thank him for his efforts. The Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali  has been at the helm of our Organization for nearly a year now. We have already appreciated his style of work and the vigorous responses to the various crises that have beset the international community. We want to reiterate our confidence in his work and our continuing support for his leadership. I welcome into our midst  as others before me have done  the 12 new Members of the United Nations. Their admission draws the United Nations closer to the realization of the principle of universality of membership. This development is particularly welcome at this time  when a rejuvenated and vigorous United Nations is closely involved in the resolution of many conflicts and crises around the world. It makes the pronouncements and actions of the world body that much more effective. It has now become clear to all that the end of the cold war has not been a panacea for the world's ills  especially the ills of third world countries. In some areas  and in some respects  these problems have been compounded by the upsurge in intense nationalism and new brands of religion. The end of the cold war has not yet brought tangible results and change for the Palestinian people in the Middle East  the black majority in South Africa  or peace to the peoples of Afghanistan  Cambodia  the Western Sahara and many other areas of conflict in the world. However  new and determined efforts are being made to resolve some of these problems peacefully  and we hope that these efforts will succeed. The tenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement  held recently in Indonesia  drew attention to the failure of all the multilateral talks aimed at narrowing the gap between developed and third world countries. In many areas  this economic gap has widened. The Summit confirmed the validity of the Movement in the current international situation  but it urged its members both to join hands in fighting the common economic and financial problems of the South and to promote economic cooperation among members of the South themselves. The fast-growing economies of South-East Asian countries have shown the capacity for intra-regional cooperation among developing countries and what can be achieved. In the place of cold-war issues  the Movement has put economic and financial matters on its agenda  and we hope that these will be tackled very forcefully over the next three years. In our region of southern Africa  our economic problems have been compounded by the very severe drought we are all facing. In the past  we used to export large quantities of white maize  but this year we have had to import 13 million tons of grain alone. Although the States in the region are fully cooperating in the areas of transport and energy supply  other areas of our cooperation would be greatly increased were the evil apartheid system in South Africa brought to an end and a non-racial and democratic system established in that country. The regime of President F. W. de Klerk which has been commented upon by a number of speakers has put the brakes on the transition process that was being discussed at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (COPESA). It has also very effectively undermined the entire process by condoning and abetting the escalating violence against innocent black people and demonstrators. Mr. de Klerk has lost credibility in the eyes of the international community. He must take steps now to release all political prisoners; we are told there are 140 prisoners still languishing in jail. He must abandon or close down the single men's hostels  which are being used by armed gangs as camps. He must forbid the carrying of any weapon for any purpose in public places. He should disband all extraterritorial battalions  such as Koevoet and Battalions 31 and 32; in fact  he should ban all private armies and militia units. These are not drastic measures by any means. They are the minimum steps that must be taken to level the playing field so that all South African political parties and teams can play on it. The current problems of prisoners  hostels  weapons and private militias are a direct consequence of the evil system of apartheid itself  which the international community has described as a crime against humanity. We must stress that that system has not yet ended  although some bold steps have been taken in the last two years towards removing it. But it is still there. We commend the role the international community has played  and continues to play  in South Africa in line with Security Council resolution 765 (1992) of 16 July 1992. It is still our belief that to deal adequately with the situation of violence in the country a substantial number of observers many more than the current 50 or so - should be dispatched to the country so that they cover all potential flash points. Only a credible and effective international presence can prevent the violence and restore the confidence among the parties in South Africa that is necessary for successful negotiations. It has become obvious that the international community has made the greatest headway on the South African issue when it has acted in unison. We need unity-in-action from the international community. The De Klerk Government must come out unequivocally on the side of majority rule as understood by all civilised nations  without any conditions or vetoes for minorities. The regime's primary responsibility is to provide security and safety for all South Africans  and therefore it needs to take decisive action not only for the protection of all citizens of the country  as I indicated earlier  but also to carry forward the current process of eliminating apartheid through peaceful means. Developments elsewhere in our region give much greater cause for hope  but the peace processes in question need to be carefully nurtured if success is to be guaranteed. In Angola adequate preparations appear to have been made for the general elections that are to take place in the next few days. The Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Angola gave a detailed account of the arrangements that have been made for the elections in that country. The Angolan people  he indicated  will be given an opportunity to elect a government of their choice. The greatest praise for this achievement must go to the Angolan people themselves  who have shown great maturity and patriotism in the face of difficulties and mutual suspicions nurtured by 16 years of war. Some praise must  however  also go to the United Nations  which has steadfastly supported the Angolan peace process  particularly through the deployment of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II)  a peace-keeping operation in which my country  Zimbabwe  is also playing a modest part. We are glad that the problems that had arisen with regard to the registration of voters  particularly logistical problems of access by voter-registration officials to various parts of the country  have now been resolved and that incidents of violence in the electioneering process have not been allowed to get out of hand. We also commend the pledge by the main parties in the Angolan elections that they will respect the poll result and that if they win they will endeavour to establish a government of national unity and reconciliation. The concept of bringing all sections of society into government is indeed an act of statesmanship that takes into account the traditions of the African people. With regard to Mozambique  we believe that a comprehensive cease-fire will be signed on 1 October 1992. We hope that this solemn commitment will be upheld and respected by all the signatories and  in fact  by all the Mozambican people. After so many years of fighting  Mozambicans want peace  tranquillity and progress  but to achieve peace a lot of work still remains to be done. There is need for flexibility on both sides  and for active participation by all States in the region  including the Republic of South Africa  in the peace process. Zimbabwe has done  and will continue to do  all in its power to help maintain the momentum and keep the peace process in Mozambique moving forward. As all delegates are aware  the Rome Declaration envisages an eventual United Nations monitoring role in Mozambique's electoral process  and we trust that all States will support such an undertaking by this world body. The situation in Somalia  to which many speakers have referred  is a cause of deep concern in my country; 2 million people may die and 5 million need food aid. The extent of the suffering  which is now labelled the world's worst human disaster  could have been greatly alleviated had the world body acted earlier and with speed. However  we commend the decisive steps that have now been taken by the Security Council  especially the decision to dispatch 3 500 troops to protect food shipments and distribution. My country is proud to be participating in this operation  which is aimed at averting a famine of genocidal dimensions in Somalia. We urge the various clan militias in the country not to disrupt the United Nations effort  but to engage in negotiations aimed at reuniting and bringing peace to their tortured people. The leaders of the three political factions in Somalia must be condemned for intensifying civil strife in a society that is already ravaged by so much famine and drought. They should instead be unifying and reconciling their people  reconciling the nation  in order to enable it to withstand the drought more effectively. In West Africa the continued elusiveness of a solution to the Liberian conflict is also a cause of grave concern. We commend the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Governments to bring peace and democracy to Liberia. Fighting between rival factions in recent days may embroil forces of the ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in more fighting and make the whole situation intractable. We urge our Liberian brothers to put the safety and future of their people and country before personal gain and aggrandizement  and we urge our ECOWAS brothers also to continue with their efforts in attempting to bring peace to Liberia. The crisis in the Middle East has dragged on for a long time  dating from the cold-war era. Our hopes were raised that a solution would be found in the current round of peace talks that began with the Madrid Conference. We still place our hopes in that process  and hope that the advent of a Labour Government in Israel will result in a more imaginative and flexible attitude that can lead to a solution adequately addressing the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people. Clearly  the new Israeli Government must accept the principle of the complete withdrawal of its troops of occupation from Palestine and the assumption of full control by the Palestinians over their own resources  including water resources  as fundamental to the resolution of the Palestinian issue. Further  it is important for the United Nations to assume a central role in the peace process  particularly as its resolutions served as terms of reference for the Madrid Conference.  There are many other areas of crisis and conflict that require  and are getting  the attention of this world body  such as Cyprus  Cambodia  Afghanistan  Western Sahara and others. The United Nations must continue to ensure that in Western Sahara  the referendum plan is carried out in a manner that reflects the genuine aspirations of the Sahrawi people; that in Cambodia  full and comprehensive implementation of the Paris Accords is achieved; that in Cyprus  a solution that preserves the unity of the country and its sovereignty and territorial integrity is found; and that in Afghanistan also  the unity of the country is ensured and peace realized. The most explosive areas in the whole world today  however  remain the countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  which have been the subject of much comment by earlier speakers. In these areas  once the communist parties that held power collapsed  the remaining  separate ethnic entities were engulfed in intense local tribalism and in an upsurge of religious fundamentalism. Our experiences in Africa reveal that social situations of tribalism and/or religious fundamentalism cannot be resolved simply by calling an election  or by using military force alone; what is often required is a deliberate act of national reconciliation that establishes a government of national unity and distributes power and influence to every segment of the society. This is a political game in which there should be no losers: the purpose of an election becomes that of establishing the relative strengths of the participating parties and therefore the weight or seats they should have in a government of national unity. In the case of Yugoslavia  from the very beginning my delegation felt that when the upsurge of tribal feeling hit that unhappy land  a conference of national reconciliation should have been convened. If some tribes insisted on getting out of the federal arrangement  they should have been required to sign a treaty guaranteeing the rights of the minority tribes to power-sharing and to enforcement of full human rights within their own territories  because let us face it - the main problem in Yugoslavia is the patchwork of tribal units that are spread throughout that land. We ourselves have never believed that the European Economic Community's policy of early recognition of Croatia and Slovenia on the one hand and the severe punishment of Serbia and Montenegro on the other would solve the problems of tribal and religious feelings in Bosnia and Herzegovina  where the numbers in the ethnic mix are almost equal. We strongly condemn the obnoxious policy of so-called ethnic cleansing by the competing tribes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The expulsion or killing of any one person in the process of so-called cleansing does not solve any problem; instead  it creates a psychological  vicious circle of communal violence. However  when we discuss the question of Yugoslavia in this world body soon  we would urge a word of caution: to seek reconciliation and not to ridicule any of the warring tribes of former Yugoslavia. The fact that persons drawn from different ethnic  racial  religious  linguistic and cultural groups live together should be a point of strength rather than weakness; in fact  former Yugoslavia used to pride itself on that very fact. Here in the United States of America  the country draws much strength from the cultural diversity of its people  who live together happily under one political system. That is broadly what we should aim at in the context of the Balkans. The subject of restructuring the United Nations system has been on our agenda for some time now. My delegation put some specific proposals before the summit of world leaders held here last January. The thrust of our contribution was the need to democratize the international system and the empowerment of the voice of third world countries within that system. We are pleased that the Secretary-General has followed up the work of that summit with a comprehensive statement entitled ""An Agenda for Peace"" (A/47/277). We agree with most of the well-thought-out conclusions and suggestions in the report; in particular  we agree with the emphasis he puts on democratic practices and the commitment to full human and political rights within our societies. On the subject of tribalism and nationalism  which we have been discussing  he says: ""if every ethnic  religious or linguistic group claimed statehood  there would be no limit to fragmentation  and peace  security and economic well-being for all would become ever more difficult to achieve"". (A/47/277  para. 17) We also endorse the recommendation that more should be done to assist the countries that become victims of economic sanctions applied by this world body against other States. A meaningful and fair programme and mode of compensation for victim States would encourage them to apply United Nations-sponsored sanctions more faithfully  which would result in greater effectiveness of those sanctions. It is also our view that the United Nations should have its own dedicated and committed armed units on a permanent basis  so that in its enforcement actions the world body acts as the world body  not as only some of its parts or some of its Members. The Charter itself provides for the United Nations to function in that fashion  and we believe that it is time the relevant provisions in this regard were reactivated. Given the centrality of the Security Council to the question of the maintenance of international peace and security  any discussion of security issues cannot be complete without a look at the procedures of that body itself. We are aware of the circumstances in which the power of veto was given to those who now possess it in the Council. The point at issue now is whether arrangements that appeared fair or at least justifiable 47 years ago are still viable today. We believe this is an issue which needs rational discussion in which all States would participate equally and all views would be given a fair hearing. Only such a fair exchange of views can result in the peaceful new world order that we are all seeking. Needless to say  conflicts are not only the result of injustice within and among nations but also the result of poverty  want and despair. The past decade has seen a massive deterioration in the standards of living of peoples in the developing world. This poverty is traceable not only to the policies of individual third world Governments but also to the capricious and pernicious international environment in which they operate: not only have the prices for raw materials - the mainstays of our economies - been seriously depressed throughout the past decade  but we have also faced extremely high interest rates and increased protectionism from the markets of developed countries. Far from being recipients of capital  we have become net exporters of hard currency  and today we jointly labour under a foreign debt of some $1.3 trillion. Some of us have  in addition to all this  suffered natural disasters such as the drought  to which I have referred  that is ravaging southern Africa at the present time. Poverty and want breed despair  and despair  of course  breeds conflict. If the international community is to address peace and security issues adequately  it needs to attend seriously to the causes of despair in the world today. There can be no human right greater than the right to food  the right to shelter and the right to life itself and  during life  the right to literacy. The world body and its specialized agencies must address these issues as a matter of urgency. In this regard  we are pleased at the plethora of projects now under way to make the United Nations focus on issues of economic development and social and humanitarian issues  such as the Nordic project. We believe the time has also come when a frank appraisal should be made of the global economy with a view to eliminating some of the built-in obstacles to growth for developing countries. I must return again to the theme of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries  namely  how to close the widening economic gap between rich and poor nations. My delegation supports the convening of an international conference on social development  planned for 1994 or 1995. Such a gathering would assist in defining clearly the basic needs of human beings on this Earth in this nuclear age  needs which must be met in order for them to live a decent  satisfying and enriched life - in answer to the question. What does an ordinary human being need? and it would also map out a genuine path of development for third world countries in the South. The conference could play a very important part in showing the correct path to development. The paths that have been chosen for development have led us in different directions  and some of them have led us into culs-de-sac. We need to think deeper and to act more decisively in order to chart the correct path. To that extent  we strongly support the convening of the conference on social development. That should be the essence of the new world order to which we should all aspire. It should be an international order guided by the twin objectives of universal peace and security  on the one hand  and an improved quality of life for all the Earth's inhabitants  on the other. It must also be an order characterized by justice and respect for international law. We third world countries should join enthusiastically in the promotion of the current Decade of International Law  because that is our only shield against the arbitrary actions of some big Powers. Our sovereignty and our national self-determination are deeply rooted in our political philosophies  of various kinds  but they are also anchored in the practice of international law. We should uphold that shield even more vigorously in the so-called new world order that is emerging. We should also uphold the Charter of the United Nations  which gives us some of the basic principles on which the international system has operated for so many years  nearly half a century. Today we stand at a crossroads. The collapse of the old order gives us the rare opportunity to build something new in its place. Shall we use this opportunity wisely  or not? History has taught us salutary lessons about the price mankind has had to pay for opportunities that are missed. In our deliberations in this forum and in others  we shall all help determine the shape of this new order that is coming. Zimbabwe intends to participate  with others  actively in that debate to ensure that the much-heralded new world order will be a just  humane and enlightened one that will bring an improvement to the quality of life of all of humanity and provide for the basic needs of all human beings  and especially in our developing societies. The global community has the means and the capacity to provide for those basic needs. "
