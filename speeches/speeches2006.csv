"1",36,"AFG",61,2006,"Every year our gathering under this roof does homage to the foresight of our predecessors  who  by founding the United Nations  envisioned the unity of nations. Today  this Assembly embodies that vision: the vision of our interdependence as members of a single community of nations. This vision has a strong resonance in Afghanistan  where both our past troubles and our recent accomplishments are  in large part  related to the outside world.  When I last addressed the Assembly in 2004 I spoke about the tremendous progress that Afghanistan had achieved since 2001. Today that story of success continues. Over the past two years we have taken further significant steps forward  attaining all the milestones in Afghanistan’s post-war transition. Millions of Afghans have participated in two general elections  one for the president and another for the parliament. With the inauguration of our National Assembly last year all three independent branches of a democratic state were completed. We have continued to build schools and clinics and create employment opportunities for our people. Our trade with the region and beyond is growing very rapidly. Industrial activity is gradually taking root. As a result  Afghanistan’s income per capita has doubled since 2002.  At the London Conference earlier this year our Government presented Afghanistan’s National Development Strategy for the next five years  which the international community endorsed. Afghanistan and its international partners also entered into a compact  the Afghanistan Compact  which provides the framework for continued international cooperation in Afghanistan. Under the compact we Afghans committed to continue to work towards a stable and prosperous Afghanistan  with good governance and human rights protection for all under the rule of law. In return  the international community pledged continued and long-term political  military and financial assistance.  Regrettably  it is not all positive news that I have to share today. Over the past year our efforts to build Afghanistan into a stable  prosperous and democratic polity have also encountered setbacks. We have seen terrorism rebounding as terrorists have infiltrated our borders to step up their murderous campaign against our people. Terrorism sees in the prosperity of the    06-52879 2  Afghan people its ultimate defeat. That is why our schools and clinics get burned down  and our ulema  our teachers and our doctors get killed. That is why today 200 000 of our students who went to school a year ago are no longer able to do so.  It is also sobering to know that polio  the children’s disease  increased from only four cases in 2005 to 27 this year. All those cases occurred in some areas of southern Afghanistan where terrorists are preventing children’s access to vaccination and health care.  Terrorists are prepared to cross any boundary and commit horrific acts of violence to try to derail Afghanistan from its path to success. They want the international community to fail in its collective endeavour to help Afghanistan to rebuild. That is why they decapitate elderly women  blow up mosques full of worshippers and kill schoolchildren in indiscriminate bombings of civilian areas. That is why they are killing international soldiers and civilians who have come to Afghanistan to help the Afghan people  such as the four Canadian soldiers who were killed four days ago while distributing notebooks and candies to children in a village in Kandahar  or the Turkish engineer who was building roads in Helmand. Clearly  unless we confront them more decisively  terrorists will continue to take lives and inflict greater damage.  To be sure  terrorism does not emanate from within Afghanistan; Afghanistan is its worst victim. Military action in Afghanistan alone  therefore  will not deliver our shared goal of eliminating terrorism. We must look beyond Afghanistan to the sources of terrorism. We must destroy terrorist sanctuaries beyond Afghanistan  dismantle the elaborate networks in the region that recruit  indoctrinate  train  finance  arm and deploy terrorists. We must ensure that political currents and entities in the region are not allowed to use extremism as an instrument of policy.  Fighting terrorism effectively is also tied to our fight against narcotics. The menace of narcotics feeds terrorism and threatens the foundation of legitimate economic development in Afghanistan and also  of course  in the region.  A combination of factors — mainly the lack of a security environment conducive to our counter-narcotics efforts  the absence of a comprehensive alternative livelihoods programme and clandestine credit flows to poppy farmers — is behind the narcotics trade. Afghanistan is committed to fighting narcotics  alongside terrorism  with strength and determination and through a combination of law enforcement and economic measures. We expect that the international community will continue to support us in this fight by enabling us to provide meaningful alternative livelihoods to our farmers.  In the context of the United Nations role in enhancing global security we endorse the recommendations of the Secretary-General for a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy and welcome the recent adoption of the strategy by the General Assembly.  We also express our support for the proposal to convene a high-level conference on international terrorism with a view to concluding the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism at the earliest possible opportunity.  Afghanistan also attaches great importance to the various initiatives undertaken to promote understanding and cooperation among civilizations. Afghanistan stands ready to contribute to further enriching these initiatives with our knowledge and experience of international cooperation and interdependence.  Meanwhile  we remain deeply concerned at the increased incidence of Islamophobia in the West. This trend does not bode well for the cause of building understanding and cooperation across civilizations. As a Muslim nation  Afghanistan is committed not only to safeguarding the interest of our Holy Faith but also to building bridges of understanding and friendship among followers of all faiths.  The situation in the Middle East  including the question of Palestine  remains a source of great concern to us in Afghanistan. Afghanistan strongly supports the full realization of the rights of the Palestinian people  including the right to sovereignty and an independent State of Palestine living side by side in peace and coexistence with the State of Israel. Afghanistan also shares the pain of the people of Lebanon as they suffer a terrible relapse into destruction caused by war. We hope that the international community will step in with concern and generosity to address Lebanon’s needs so that it may recover.   3 06-52879   To conclude  I thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his exemplary leadership in serving the cause of global security and prosperity. I thank him especially for his interest in and commitment to Afghanistan and for his contribution to making our world a more secure place.  I also thank the members of the international community for their steadfast and generous support for Afghanistan over the past five years. I convey the gratitude of the Afghan people for the sacrifices that the men and women in uniform from about 40 countries throughout the world have made in the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan. We will honour those sacrifices by remaining true to our vision of building a secure  democratic and prosperous Afghanistan that will contribute to the progress of our region and to the security of the world at large.

"2",75,"AGO",61,2006,"On behalf of my Government  I wish to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident that under her guidance and leadership  this session will be productive and will attain the goals set. I assure her of my delegation’s full cooperation.  I would also like to take this opportunity to express my country’s appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the valuable work he has performed during the 10 years of his mandate  which is now drawing to a close.  Mr. Annan has made an indelible mark on the history of the United Nations by paying special attention to the most pertinent problems affecting our planet  especially the African continent. In particular  Angola praises the role which Mr. Annan has played during the most critical phase of the Organization’s history. I trust that the next Secretary-General will find in Mr. Kofi Annan’s legacy an impressive reference for the reinforcement of the Organization’s capacity to deal with the principal problems facing humanity.  The aspirations to stability  security and social justice of the peoples represented in this Assembly continue to be unfulfilled. The persisting armed violence in some States and the meagre results in the fight against world poverty have been contributing to this picture; consequently  these make up the chief challenges facing the United Nations.  With regard to the new tendencies towards violence  we see something new. It is more indiscriminate; it emerges not only from inter-State or internal conflicts  but rather  and increasingly  it arises from actions that seek to alter the way of life of societies through intimidation and the brutal destruction of human lives.  In recent times alone  over a dozen countries in four continents have been severely affected by acts of terror  which have become the most direct and immediate threat to international peace and security. In spite of political or ideological differences  the international community has  in general terms  demonstrated firmness and unity in the fight against acts of terror. We are of the view that this form of collective action must continue to be the most appropriate way of dealing with threats to international security  including terrorism.  Poverty indexes around the world are also a contributing factor to the bleak present-day international situation. Half of the world’s population  or three billion people  continue to live on less than two dollars a day; 640 million people are without appropriate housing; 400 million people do not have access to drinking water; and 270 million people lack medical assistance. Close to one billion people have entered the twenty-first century illiterate and with little hope of emerging from spiritual and material poverty.  Africa is the continent most affected by this scourge  and not even the potential for economic growth of some of our countries permits us to hope that the poverty indexes will be drastically reduced.  Notwithstanding this unwelcome picture  in recent times  we have seen significant progress in the area of peace and security  democracy and respect for human rights. For instance  the resolution through dialogue of the Angolan internal conflict  which was among the longest-running conflicts in Africa  constitutes one of the more significant success stories in this regard. Recently  the Angolan Government opted for the same path of dialogue and negotiation in order to extend the peace process to the territory of Cabinda  where some insecurity persisted.  The establishment of peace in Angola was the supreme objective of a sensible and principled political process led by President José Eduardo dos Santos  whose goals were: to liberate  together with some forces in our region  the people of southern Africa from the dominance of oppressor regimes; to settle the conflicts in Central Africa through negotiation; to extinguish the threat that some States represented to their neighbours; and  finally  to economically develop and integrate the region.  The fruits of this political endeavour are visible today: the people of the region  who before were under oppressive regimes  now live in freedom and have built democratic societies. With Angola’s support  one State in Central Africa settled its internal conflict  and  once    06-53005 50  free  its people took charge of their destiny and recovered their sense of peace and stability. Another State in Central Africa overthrew the dictatorship that had oppressed its people and had created a permanent focus of regional tension by acting as a source of instability for neighbouring countries. Today  the people of that country are engaged in building a new democratic society by means of transparent elections and national reconciliation.  Now that peace has been achieved  one of the fundamental objectives of the Government of Angola is the complete elimination of factors of conflict. We have prioritized the pursuit of political reforms with a view to the consolidation of a democratic regime and a righteous State  aware that these constitute prerequisites for the maintenance of peace  political stability  respect for citizens’ rights and economic development. This is a serious commitment which my Government will not forsake  the main objective being the regular holding of elections.  The next electoral process is at an advanced stage of preparation  and voter registration will begin next November. My Government is creating all the necessary conditions to make the next elections transparent and credible  so that their results are accepted by all the parties  and so that they constitute a step on the road to prosperity. Therefore  the organization of the next elections is going ahead surely and firmly.  Other priorities are the reintegration of the displaced population  refugees and former combatants  as well as the rehabilitation of the economy and the reduction of poverty. These areas have registered important progress. In only four years of peace  roughly 4.5 million displaced persons and more than 400 000 refugees have been resettled. Nearly 200 000 former combatants and members of their families have been socially and productively reintegrated; and countless infrastructures that were destroyed by the conflict are also being rehabilitated.  The national economy is characterized by a solid macroeconomic stability resulting from a coherent monetary and budgetary policy. It is among the fastest-growing economies in the world. For 2006 and future years  we foresee continuous  vigorous economic growth  of the order of 20 per cent.  In social terms  the results over the last four years are also encouraging. Poverty has been reduced from over 80 per cent to 56 per cent. With the ongoing implementation of poverty reduction programmes and substantial investment in capital goods  we foresee a gradual improvement of social well-being and employment indexes in the short term. The global advances which my country has achieved in four years of peace are evidence that its people can look to the new Angola with real hope. The international community can count on Angola as a dependable partner.  In the area of peace  important progress has been made in other parts of the African continent. The Democratic Republic of the Congo  a neighbour and brother of Angola  is steadily approaching a situation of normality  which is likely to contribute to the lessening of tensions in Central Africa and in the Great Lakes region. Recently  and for the first time in its history  the people of this country exercised their right to freely choose their legitimate representatives. Such an act marks a crucial stage in the process of democratic transition and the consolidation of internal stability. It was made possible by the support of the international community  particularly of Angola  which supplied $30 million and some logistical means for the electoral process.  Angola has always stood by the Congolese people and always will. It contributed to the cessation of the internal conflict that devastated the country and is currently contributing to building the capacity of the Congolese institutions charged with maintaining internal peace  security and order. It is now up to the Congolese parties to demonstrate that they are truly committed to peace and democracy. We want to believe that they will not frustrate the expectations of their people and of the international community and that they will respect the verdict of the ballot box.  The situation in Côte d’Ivoire remains volatile. The Ivorian people continue to be the principal victims of a conflict that is jeopardizing the country’s future. Angola associates itself with the efforts of the international community to reach a definitive and peaceful resolution of the conflict in that country.  In the Middle East  the continuing violence is rendering ineffective any blueprints for peace aimed at resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Angola supports the right to existence of all States in the area as well as their right to live in peace with their neighbours. It is important to return to a process aimed   51 06-53005  at the peaceful resolution of the conflict — a process based on the road map for peace — in order to arrive at a comprehensive solution leading to regional stabilization.  Angola hopes that the people of Iraq and of Afghanistan will be able  in the short term  to fulfil their aspirations to live free from violence and from tension  and that those countries will be respected as sovereign and genuine States.  In conclusion  we would like to reiterate our desire that the process of reform of the United Nations  mainly of the Security Council  be accelerated. The current composition of that organ is anachronistic and fails to reflect the contemporary structures of the international community.  In the context of United Nations reform  we wish to stress the importance of the recent creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and of the Human Rights Council. I would like in that respect to express my gratitude to all Members of the United Nations for the trust they placed in my country  which is to preside over the Peacebuilding Commission during its first years of existence. "
"3",122,"ALB",61,2006,"I would like first of all to congratulate President Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to her high post and to assure her of Albania’s full support throughout her mandate. I would also like to express our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his continuous vision  leadership and efforts to revitalize and reform the United Nations.  This year  based on the 2005 Summit Document  Albania has undertaken concrete actions to promote the three main pillars  namely  development  security and human rights  in order to implement the ambitious United Nations agenda of reforms. We are filled with optimism at the positive results achieved by the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  the Human Rights Council and the Central Emergency Response Fund. Reform of the Secretariat and management also give us optimism and lead us to believe that the United Nations must continue these reforms in order to respond in the best possible way to new realities and challenges.  We reiterate our willingness and intent to work closely with all delegations and to reach as much agreement as possible by consensus in all significant aspects of the reforms and we believe that solid and inclusive management reform is needed for the strengthening of the United Nations in order to increase transparency and responsibility and achieve a more effective and efficient administration of resources. We support the efforts to reform the Economic and Social Council  while we also believe that reform in the Security Council will produce progress and results  thanks to the efforts and commitment of all member countries.  We welcome the High-level Meeting on International Migration and Development  because we believe that international migration that is supported by the right policies can bring major advantages to the development of the countries of origin and destination  in terms of respecting and guaranteeing the basic rights of migrants  while avoiding discrimination and double standards.  The United Nations role also continues to remain very important in the war against terrorism  especially in securing an effective  global and intensive response to this threat. We praise the recent consensual adoption of the Global Strategy against Terrorism. We also feel that the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism would represent a precious achievement furthering United Nations efforts to combat terrorism. Albania is collaborating very closely with all the United Nations bodies in the war against terrorism  and the visits of the Monitoring Team  established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1267 (1999)  and the visit of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee  established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1540 (2004)  demonstrate that Albania is fulfilling its obligations to prevent the activity and financing of terrorist groups at the national level.  We have supported Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) on the Israeli-Lebanon conflict  which provides for a peaceful solution of the issue and the sending of peacekeeping forces to that area. Albania has joined other countries in giving financial support to rebuild Lebanon.  The main orientation of Albania’s foreign policy remains European and Euro-Atlantic integration  and that is why the efforts of the Albanian State and society are directed towards meeting European Union and NATO standards. A few days ago  the European Parliament ratified the Stabilization and Association Agreement between Albania and the European Union    25 06-52885  which places our country at the most important  stage — that of fulfilling the obligations that stem from the Agreement  and all Albanian political groups and the entire society are conscious of this. We all believe that actual membership in the European Council and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  and the prospective accession to the EU and NATO are part of the natural move towards development  rather than an objective per se.  We have established relations based on active cooperation and dialogue at the regional level with all the countries concerned by actively working to strengthen regional security and stability. Together with the countries of the region  we have created an agenda of joint action against terrorism  organized crime  the circulation of arms and border management. In the same way  we have undertaken concrete initiatives to encourage economic development in the region.  Albania believes that the main issue to be resolved in our region continues to be that of Kosovo. Kosovo has made great progress in terms of internal stability; advancing the fulfilment of the required international standards; improving inter-ethnic relations; establishing and efficiently running central and local Kosovar institutions; its serious and professional commitment to the process of negotiations with Belgrade through the intermediary of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  President Ahtisaari; and in its gradual integration into regional activities  initiatives and structures as part of Kosovo’s integrating process in the European Union and NATO.  The leadership of Kosovo  the representative Kosovar institutions  the political opposition  civil society  the media and the entire civil factor are demonstrating social and political cohesion and increasing unity and open and full cooperation with the international factor to build a sovereign  independent  democratic and multi-ethnic State integrated into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures and at peace with its neighbours. The United Nations Mission and the commitments of the Secretary-General have also played a significant part in that success.  The progress of talks between Pristina and Belgrade in Vienna is positive. We encourage the continuation of constructive dialogue and hope that the Serbian side will do the same by demonstrating realism  solidarity with the will of the international community  and respect for the aspirations of the people of Kosovo. Albania opposes any possible scenario for the partition or disintegration of Kosovo  which past experience suggests could entail conflict and instability in the future.  We support a full and speedy solution to the issue of the status of Kosovo that takes into consideration the will of its inhabitants and guarantees functionality within the Kosovar State and society and the freedoms of the minority communities. A sovereign  independent  democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovar State with a clear Euro-Atlantic perspective will serve the interests of peace and stability in the region and beyond.  The view occasionally expressed that the independence of Kosovo would encourage the implementation of similar solutions to current problems in other countries and regions does not seem accurate to us. The solution of any problem must take the historical and geographical context into account  along with other considerations that exclude the search for and mechanical application of inappropriate analogies. Given the historical  juridical and moral aspects of the issue of Kosovo  as well as the fact that it evolved through the convulsions and wars that accompanied the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia  I believe that its solution in accordance with the will of the citizens of Kosovo themselves is entirely legitimate. In that light  the solution will also mark the final stage of that disintegration and the turning of a new page as part of democratic developments in the Balkans over the past decade.  Albania is at an important phase in the process of comprehensive institutional  legal and economic reform with a view to adopting European models and standards. We are committed to improving governance at all levels to ensure that it adheres as closely as possible to the interests of our citizens and the country. The current Government has undertaken various economic initiatives to liberalize procedures and enhance our capacity to attract foreign investment. We are aware that this objective can be achieved only through reforms that realistically promote a competitive and open market for unfettered initiative that offers as many people as possible the opportunity to conduct business or to be employed and is coordinated with reforms in the priority public sectors. Such reforms include increasing investment in infrastructure and the energy  education and health    06-52885 26  sectors  complemented by effective social policies in favour of social groups and individuals in need. Our objective is for economic growth to contribute directly to meeting the Millennium Development Goals by making it the main factor in the reduction of poverty  reducing the unemployment rate to the average level of the developed European countries  and securing stable and long-term economic growth that enhances opportunity for future generations.  A comprehensive campaign against corruption is part of our efforts to strengthen the rule of law and develop the country. In that framework  concrete action is being taken to implement legislative and institutional reform in order to take preventive measures  narrow opportunities for corruptive abuses  enhance public transparency  eliminate conflicts of interest  improve access to decision-making  and strengthen the monitoring role of civil society  local communities and the media.  We have also paid special attention to the fight against organized crime  drug and human trafficking  and money-laundering. Today we can state with full conviction that those phenomena are being met with the full power of the law and the country’s consolidated structures  and in cooperation with the international factor. That is why our results have been significant.  Albania supports and contributes to a strong and effective United Nations capable of meeting new challenges  because we believe the Organization to be based on the values and principles of multilateralism  global partnership for development  and joint action to strengthen collective peace and security to the benefit of human rights  the rule of law and commitments against terrorism.  In conclusion  allow me to affirm that my country will be active in fulfilling the commitments and obligations arising from its responsibilities within the Organization and from those decisions that the General Assembly will adopt at its sixty-first session. "
"4",145,"AND",61,2006,"A decade ago  it was said that with the end of the cold war we had reached the “end of history.” Over the years  this view has been largely discredited.   Much of the world  especially the West  paid scant attention to the sense of injustice shared by many peoples and communities around the world. What we have witnessed  with a mixture of horror  sympathy and unease over the last 10 years  has been the return of history. The fall of the Twin Towers  the wars in Afghanistan  Iraq and Lebanon and the terrorist attacks in London and Madrid have shaken the foundations of the secular State. These events have been said to represent a “clash of civilizations ” but I reject the reductive  indeed  misleading division between North and South  East and West  and Christians and Muslims.   The greatest achievements in the West were the result of a complex process of cultural exchange between East and West. The free trade of ideas fostered innovation and advances in understanding. We must therefore reject this notion of a mentality that conceives an essential clash between “us” and “them”. I believe that we are living through a turbulent and bloody struggle between  on the one hand  the forces of extremism  present in both the East and the West  and  on the other hand  secular tolerance  also fortunately manifested everywhere on Earth.  Andorra is an old country whose borders have remained unchanged since 1278. Our history is one of survival. We were in existence when the Cathars fled the might of the first Crusade to seek refuge in our mountain pastures. We survived the French Revolution  the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War. History has taught us that power demands restraint. And our own experiences have taught us — and the past few weeks have reinforced this costly lesson — that displays of military might  intended to shock and awe  cannot  by themselves  bring about the desired result.  Is it not paradoxical that at this moment  when the need for civilized discussion between people is greater than ever  this venerable institution is deemed inconsequential? We need  of course  to continue the process of its reform. As an idea  however  this place embodies all of our hopes. As a humanitarian agency with a host of vital social programmes  the United Nations does inestimable work. As a forum for rational discourse committed to reaching global understanding  its work is absolutely necessary. This should be the forum in which we try to understand and correctly interpret the crossroads at which we find ourselves. The United Nations signifies the world’s moral conscience — the principle of equality and solidarity and the protection of human rights and human dignity. It marks the path to development.  Violence and the rise of religious extremism have roiled the globe. We all are prey to the unease felt over the future of the secular State. In one sense  however  the very idea of the nation-State lies at the heart of many of our problems. It encourages us to believe in the rhetoric of “us” against “them”  in exclusive identities and in outdated ethnocentric discourse. It obfuscates the growing division between rich and poor that transcends countries  nations  and continents. It neglects the fact that most people on this planet seek only that which will permit them to live in a dignified manner and be happy in their lives.  Indeed  many States  especially those whose boundaries reflect a legacy of colonialism  are constituted without regard to the religious or ethnic backgrounds of their inhabitants. The civil wars that are currently tearing apart some countries are but one example of the enormous difficulties presented by the artificial construction of such States.  We must not forget that  historically  the West has never been a good example in terms of religious tolerance. On the contrary  one might cite the twelfth-century expulsion of the Jews from England or recall    06-53005 10  the forced conversion of Muslims after the fall of Granada in 1492  the Inquisition  or the persecution of the Protestant Huguenots who fled France during the sixteenth century. Yet in the East — in Jerusalem or Tehran  for example — Muslims  Jews and Christians coexisted into the early twentieth century. Those great cosmopolitan centres flourished in an atmosphere of genuine religious tolerance.  The original meaning of the term secular described those religious orders that looked outwards to the world at large. In the sixteenth century a new notion of tolerance signified a willingness to accept different Protestant sects in towns and cities in Northern Europe. But our modern-day understanding of tolerance  in which people of all religions can live together  required centuries. Curiously  this version of history has been forgotten by those who see secularism as being opposed to belief. The notion of secularism has never been oppositional to religion but rather denotes a mentality willing to contemplate uncertainty and imperfect knowledge. It does not confuse questions of faith with scientific questions or seek to disarm the individual’s liberty of conscience.  Secularism  therefore  recognizes the shared fallibility of the human race. Religious faith can be taught  but it cannot be imposed. It cannot lead to violence and has to coexist with the secular state. Our common humanity requires us to respect each other through our diversity.  The genius of tolerance lies in the ability to listen — to truly listen and attempt to understand. To listen and learn is not an act of weakness. Indeed  it is the extremist’s display of strength or desire for revenge that represents a fatal weakness. Again and again  in the course of history  we see that a mighty spirit precedes a fall. Recently we have stood by and witnessed in dismay the catastrophic results that ensue from the deployment of military might against determined guerrilla warfare.  Most of today’s ills have their roots in old and unresolved problems  but the rhetoric of violence which surrounds us polarizes us even further  undermines the possibility of finding a lasting solution and widens the lines of fracture. We have to think of ourselves as a single global community where we are all interdependent.   In the Middle East  we recognize the need for Israel’s security  as we recognize the need for Palestine to become a viable State.  Andorra is located in a part of the world which has always been a place where different cultures have met and lived in shared prosperity: the Mediterranean. Today  this has become a new frontier full of tension. As Europeans  we must seek to revitalize the area  recalling its ancient history as a home to many civilizations and their corresponding values — from Rome to Byzantium and from Athens to Tangiers.  Andorra  like many small countries  long relied on its isolation for its survival. But in our global world  mountains can no longer protect us. International concerns press upon us. Today’s world is heterogeneous  imperfect and lacking in a common vision; there are no easy solutions  and questions cannot be viewed in monochrome. The Millennium goals that we debated here with such hope are in danger of receding into distant memory. Is this the fault of the United Nations? Let us not turn our backs on the masses  who are tired of suffering  and who see the United Nations as being their only hope. We must allow their voices to be heard and welcome them into the global community. The time has come for us to act on our promises.  We must recognize that collectively we are the United Nations. We represent humanity as a whole. We are betraying it if we do not seek to make the United Nations a more robust and efficient machine. If we continue blindly  caring only for our national self-interest  we betray its trust. Multilateralism  which we as a group embody in this Hall  is the path that will lead to many of the solutions. The plight of the unfortunate should not fall on deaf ears. We should join together to solidify democratic institutions and processes  and in so doing fight against poverty  war  disease  illiteracy and corruption. That should be our common cause. It is only through this joint effort that we will be able to raise our approach to a collectively ethical and morally correct level.  When people do not have enough to eat and when they are deprived of essential freedoms and justice  there is only one option left open to them: to seek a better life by whatever means they can  leaving behind their native lands. We are currently witnessing mass migration from the poorest parts of the world to the richer; all too often  the journey is tragically cut short   11 06-53005  on the high seas. This weighs heavily on our conscience. Erecting barriers to prevent this process will never work: their desperation is too great. Millions of human beings are orphaned from their homelands — we should have solutions to offer them. There is no place where this issue is more pressing than sub-Saharan Africa. The high risk of death does not impede people from attempting to reach the shores of Europe  simply because their lives at home have become unbearable.  We require a concerted and global plan for migration. This can be achieved only if we act together through the United Nations to provide the human and material resources necessary to step-up to the challenge. In so doing we will better the lives of millions of people who  quite justifiably  feel cruelly disenfranchised from the human family. As the writer Juan Goytisolo put it  “The world provides a home for those who are homeless”. The United Nations should certainly be their refuge.  In line with this  Andorra stands ready to underline its commitment to the United Nations system and to development as a whole. Two days ago here in New York  we signed an agreement with UNICEF to provide €1 million in financing over a five-year period to help children suffering from HIV/AIDS in Cameroon. Civil society in our small country is also playing its part; the Andorran National Committee for UNICEF will contribute €500 000 to this project over the same period.  It is true that our world today is a dangerous place. But there is still immense hope  and this spurs us on. There is no definitive answer to the problems that our societies face  and it has been said that our lives as human beings cannot be perfected. We have a duty  however  to continually ask questions and to have the courage to overcome the problems of our age.   Our ideas are the greatest advantage that we have; they are the motors of progress. For us  this means democracy  shared prosperity  tolerance  the rule of law  respect for human rights and the pursuit of freedom through the defence of fundamental human liberties. Those are the best weapons we have to fight absolutism and inequality. It is here at the United Nations that our voices should be heard and here that we should be able to defend those principles.  Finally  I should like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his great work over the past 10 long and complicated years. We salute and congratulate him for all that he has done to maintain and apply the principles enshrined in the Charter. I speak for all Andorrans in expressing my esteem for him and his great efforts.

"5",190,"ARE",61,2006,"It gives me pleasure  on behalf of the delegation of the United Arab Emirates  to extend to you  Madam President  and to your fraternal country  the Kingdom of Bahrain  our heartfelt congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident that your wide experience will enable you to deal wisely and competently with the issues on our agenda  and we wish you every success. We also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the skilful manner in which he managed the work of the sixtieth session  and to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his outstanding efforts  which have significantly contributed to strengthening the role of this international organization in addressing the challenges the world has faced during his term of office.   In spite of all the expectations that we hoped would be fulfilled in the areas of establishing peace and collective security  development  strengthening human rights and the rule of law  and reform of the United Nations  we meet today amid extremely serious security  political and economic conditions that have resulted in increasing poverty and epidemics and have prevented the sustainable development mechanisms from achieving the desired development goals of the 2005 Summit. Instead of intensifying our efforts to strengthen international relations and enhance positive investment in economic globalization  we had to direct our efforts towards finding temporary solutions for the grave security threats facing our world today in many regions.  The major weakness demonstrated by the performance of some bodies of this international organization  especially in those entrusted with maintaining international peace and security  requires a reconsideration of the ways to reform its main    06-52879 28  structures and working methods  particularly for the Security Council. Most recent events have proved its inability to take the immediate and effective measures needed to stop acts of aggression and to end occupation.  Therefore  as we study the proposals by the Secretary-General for developing the work of the Organization  we must ensure that reform is based on the principles of equality among States in rights and duties in order to ensure that developing and small countries are increasingly and effectively represented in the Security Council in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical distribution. It is also necessary to strengthen the working methods of the Security Council to ensure that it does not infringe upon the competencies of the Secretariat  the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council  so that the performance and effectiveness of those bodies can be strengthened and increased.  The United Arab Emirates — which collaborates with the sisterly countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  the League of Arab States and other groups in supporting all possible diplomatic and mediation efforts aimed at containing the hotbeds of tension and conflicts in the Middle East region  including the Arabian Gulf — reiterates the importance of resolving differences through peaceful means and of strengthening confidence-building measures based on the principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs. All this falls under our common responsibility to maintain the requirements of regional and international peace  security and stability.   Therefore  we ask the Islamic Republic of Iran to demonstrate its goodwill towards finding a just and lasting settlement for its occupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands  Greater and Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  by responding to our country’s repeated initiatives  which were endorsed by the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council  the Council of the League of Arab States and the international community. Those initiatives call for initiating direct and serious negotiations on this issue or referring it to the International Court of Justice for legal arbitration.  We support the right of countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We optimistically look forward to continuing the Iranian-European talks on Iran’s nuclear question in order to reach a lasting and peaceful settlement and to ensure that the safety and security of the peoples and countries of the region are not exposed to any threat  danger or unnecessary new confrontations.   We also stress that the international community must deal with this question with utmost transparency so as to ensure the implementation of all relevant resolutions of the United Nations  in particular those calling for the establishment of a zone free from weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons  in the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf. That makes it incumbent upon Israel to accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to subject all of its nuclear facilities to the IAEA safeguards regime.  The United Arab Emirates supports the political process in Iraq and efforts for its reconstruction  and hopes that the efforts of the Iraqi Government will lead to achieving national unity  consolidating security and stability in Iraq  and implementing the recommendations of the Abu Dhabi Declaration and the New York conference on the International Compact for the Reconstruction of Iraq.  We also reaffirm our full support for all regional and international measures to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  as it constitutes a grave threat to the security and sovereignty of States and causes unjustified depletion of civilian lives and properties. We also support international efforts aimed at convening an international conference to define this phenomenon  address its causes and set the standards for differentiating between terrorism and the right of people to self-determination.   As we all strive to create a suitable environment for promoting dialogue among civilizations and strengthening religious tolerance  we heard with regret and surprise the recent statements by Pope Benedict XVI  which gave an opportunity to the extremists to deepen the gap of intolerance and to raise doubts about the intentions of others. That makes it incumbent on us to avoid repeating such statements in future in order to promote further understanding between religions and civilizations.  We are deeply concerned at the continued inability of the international community to solve the Palestinian question and establish peace in the Middle East. That has encouraged Israel to continue its occupation of the Palestinian territories  the Sheba’a farms in Lebanon and the Syrian Golan  and to repeat its aggressions on various levels. Therefore  we urge the United Nations to respond today to the recent   29 06-52879  initiative of the League of Arab States  which calls upon the international organization to play an effective role in reviving the peace process in the Middle East and resume direct negotiations on all tracks  in accordance with resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative.   We also affirm that consolidation of peace and stability in the Middle East region cannot be achieved through military power or the continued and deliberate destruction of the infrastructure in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon  but through compelling Israel to ensure its full compliance with international resolutions  including the resumption of negotiations with the Palestinian Authority and the release of Palestinian funds and the thousands of Palestinian detainees and prisoners. Israel is further requested to open the crossing points to secure delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people  to remove settlements and the separation wall and to withdraw fully from all the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967  including East Jerusalem  so that the establishment of an independent Palestinian State  with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital  can be declared.  We welcome the considerable efforts by the Lebanese Government to extend its control throughout its national territories  with the support of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. In this regard we demand that the international community intensify its pressures on Israel to compel it to fulfil its legal obligations  as provided in Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  including its full respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity  handing over maps of landmines and entering into negotiations on the exchange of prisoners. We also affirm the importance of doubling the international assistance directed to the reconstruction of Lebanon.  As for the Sudan — and following up the circumstances relating to Security Council resolution 1706 (2006) — we had hoped that the Sudan would have been given sufficient time to resolve the Darfur question internally. We declare our support for the efforts of the Sudanese Government to find a lasting solution to this question. We hope that the United Nations and the African Union will continue their positive role in this regard  in conformity with the Arab League’s efforts  in order to maintain the sovereignty  territorial integrity and independence of the Sudan.   We also call for strengthening of the efforts and endeavours to reconcile political differences and disputes in regions such as Somalia  Afghanistan  other African countries and troubled regions of the world in order to contain tensions and conflicts in those regions and assist their peoples to realize their aspirations towards permanent peace  stability and prosperity.   The United Arab Emirates  which incorporated the Millennium Development Goals in its national development policy and has come a long way in the process of achieving economic and human development  has extended generous assistance to many poor and affected countries. In this regard  the United Arab Emirates would like to stress that with the ongoing problems of poverty  infectious diseases and unemployment  in addition to other economic  social and environmental problems  the international community must develop a firm and effective international mechanism that ensures a continuous flow of assistance to developing countries so as to enable them to improve their living conditions and build their national economies.   It is incumbent upon the advanced States  especially the Group of Eight  to fulfil their commitments as agreed at international conferences  especially in easing the onerous commercial conditions imposed on developing countries’ trade  on their efforts to attract foreign capital and investment and on their use of advanced technology for peaceful purposes  in order to avoid marginalizing those countries and to ensure better participation for them in international trade.  Finally  we hope that our deliberations on the agenda items during this session will have a positive outcome that will contribute to addressing the critical issues we face today  and that they will enhance our common efforts to create a world based on the principles of the rule of law  justice  tolerance and peace.

"6",237,"ARG",61,2006,"I would like to congratulate you  Ms. Al-Khalifa  on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session  since I believe it is very significant that a woman has assumed that role  to promote gender equality  which is a goal both of my Government and of the United Nations.  On behalf of the Argentine Republic  we would also like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the work he carried out  and to renew our recognition of Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his role in action promoting peace  multilateralism and the fight against poverty.  We have come to the General Assembly in the firm belief that the revitalization of this forum of global representation is fundamental so that international law can be the instrument of rationality that will enable us to settle conflicts and combat the threats to peace.  The international conduct of the Argentine Republic is inspired by the values of representative democracy  respect for fundamental human rights and active defence of international peace and security. Those principles  shared by the vast majority of the   5 06-52885  Argentine people  guide our administration and are the basis of our foreign policy decisions.  In the field of human rights  in 2003  after more than two decades of sustained democratic rule in Argentina  we experienced a true paradigm shift. In response to the mandates of the whole of society  the three powers of the State adopted  within their respective purviews  concurrent decisions against impunity  preserving memory  truth and justice and securing reparations.  The annulment by Congress of the laws that accorded impunity for State-sponsored crimes of terrorism  the ruling that those laws and pardons granted by the courts in our country were unconstitutional  and the reopening of over a thousand court proceedings for crimes against humanity — some of which have resulted in the conviction of those responsible — constitute landmarks of that shift. It is our conviction that democracy is strengthened with the simultaneous fight against impunity and promotion of full respect for the rule of law  without calling for revenge.  With that experience  we have  since the beginning of the reform of the United Nations system  strongly supported incorporating human rights into the hierarchy so as to raise the institutional level of their treatment to that already given to development and to the maintenance of international peace and security. That determination led us to establish the Human Rights Council  in whose creation Argentina participated actively.  The first steps of that body have been positive  having approved the text of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. That is an instrument of great significance for our country  as it defines a crime against humanity from which Argentina suffered massively in the past  at a high cost to our society. We have among us here today a representative of an organization that was extremely involved with that issue — one of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo  Mrs. Marta Vázquez  who is accompanying our delegation. We hope the General Assembly will adopt that very important instrument quickly  during this session.  Five years after the attacks that shocked this city and the world  we would like to firmly condemn the serious threat of global terrorism. Argentina considers all acts of terrorism against innocent civilians to be criminal and unjustifiable  and accepts no argument to justify such methods.  The Argentine people suffered two atrocious attacks in the 1990s against the Embassy of Israel and the headquarters of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina. We are still struggling  in spite of the time that has elapsed  to fully clarify the facts and punish the culprits. We believe that  in order to face this criminal threat successfully  we must carry out a sustained multilateral and legitimate response. Respect for human rights  international humanitarian law and refugee law is essential  as are international cooperation and legal assistance to effectively enforce the norms against terrorism.  If  in facing down global terrorism  we resort to a global violation of human rights  the only winner in this fight shall be terrorism. We will advance firmly in the fight against terrorism only if we frame it within respect for local laws and international norms and conventions. No complication can be an excuse for not combating terrorism within the law.  Peace is built and maintained by understanding the true concept of solidarity among nations from a wider perspective than the purely military or the predominantly unilateral. Nations big and small  rich and poor  will be markedly vulnerable if we fail to grasp that the fight against terrorism demands sustained multilateral  intelligent action firmly based in legitimacy  respect for fundamental rights  proportionality of response and the support of international public opinion.  We would like to express our concern regarding the hostilities on the border between Israel and Lebanon  resulting in hundreds of casualties  severe damage to the civilian infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of displaced persons. The violence must stop. We need to address the causes at the heart of the crisis  avoid the disproportionate use of force  and understand that only negotiated political solutions can hold in the long term. Argentina will continue to support a fair solution to the Middle East problems within the framework of resolution 1701 (2006).  We must understand that the world will move closer to peace only insofar as it promotes equality and struggles to eradicate poverty and exclusion. That is true both for the global system and for each country nationally.    06-52885 6   Argentina supports the building of societies that are fairer  more equitable and with a better distribution of the benefits of economic growth. We also believe that each country has the right to search for its own development model with no external conditionalities. We not only aspire to generate sustainable growth; we also want it to reach everyone. There must be harmonized growth that translates into a balanced income distribution  because we know that what is needed is not development for a mere few  but the development of the whole country.  In the region and in the Common Market of the South  we want an efficient instrument to address poverty and exclusion; we want the common good to prevail over sectarian interests and to overcome stagnation and the technology gap; and we want to define a sustainable and productive development model that valorizes our competitive advantages and fosters our vast wealth in human and material resources.  The economic situation of the Republic is very different from what it was when our Administration began. We are achieving true structural change. That includes uninterrupted growth at rates of between 8 and 9 per cent; the growing participation of investment in the gross domestic product; record local savings rates; the resurrection of local industry; a fiscal surplus at historic levels; a clear expansion of our industrial sales to the world; the systematic decrease of local and external public debt; the preventive accumulation of reserves; lesser external exposure; a marked drop in unemployment; a strengthening of the income of wage earners and retirees; and a significant fall of poverty and destitution levels.  With a prudent monetary policy  an orderly fiscal policy  a fiscal and commercial surplus  and a responsible management of indebtedness  we are increasingly reducing the vulnerability and uncertainty that characterized the Argentine economy in the past. Decent work  social inclusion  national production  internal consumption and sustained growth have allowed us to fulfil the goals of the Millennium Declaration  although there is still a long way to go to recover from the hell into which we had fallen.  We seek the integral sustainability of that process  not only in its macroeconomic aspects  but also guaranteeing social equity and a fairer distribution of income through the reduction of poverty and unemployment.  In implementing a national education plan with a strong federal emphasis that highlights the challenge of improving the quality of education  ensures the growing funding of the public sector  and interacts with the private sector  we seek also to achieve its strategic sustainability.  We cannot but point out that these achievements have not been supported by the International Monetary Fund  which has denied us any kind of aid  and  it must be said  that they are in many cases the result of ignoring or even contradicting its recommendations and conditionalities. We have sufficient empirical proof of the failure of international financial organizations in the promotion of development in less developed countries. In many cases  their conditionalities have actually had the opposite effect  hindering development.  The world has changed and those organizations have not. They still insist on jeopardizing advancement with their misguided interference. That is why we support  together with most countries  the reform of the international financial architecture to make it more effectual in assisting the progress of nations with fewer resources. In noting the reluctance of international financial organizations to effect any real change in their policies  we feel it necessary to endorse such change and to consider the creation of new international financial instruments that would allow us to fund development projects to fight poverty and hunger in the world and generate true options for progress.  Argentina is distressed to note the stagnation in the negotiations of the Doha Round for the development of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is imperative  within the current globalization process — from which developing countries must profit — to reach a successful and balanced result fully consistent with the mandate of the Doha Declaration. Thus  we reaffirm the need to reach a satisfactory result in agriculture in this WTO round  including a substantial reduction in domestic subsidies  the elimination of export subsidies and ample access to the markets of developed countries.  We are increasingly concerned to see the deterioration of the global environment. We affirm that there can be no double standards. The environment must be protected in developed and in developing countries  in rich countries and in poor  in the countries   7 06-52885  of the North and of the South  in the central and in the peripheral countries.  In developing their industries  the more industrialized countries have profited from a true environmental subsidy from the rest of the countries which today compromise  in their relative backwardness  a true world environmental reserve. That is why we cannot accept that those countries that have achieved greater development — often at the expense of the degradation of the environment and by producing a severe global effect evident in climate change — should seek to transfer to us the more contaminating part of their industrial processes.  There can be no reliable solutions without the concerted action of all countries of the world  insofar as the nature of the problem is of a global scale. It is unacceptable for the claims of the developing States to go unnoticed. It is imperative to take the path of solutions.  Our countries wish to receive investments and present profitable opportunities in the energy  transportation and infrastructure fields  and even in sensitive sectors. Therein lies a strong foundation for international collaboration  but we do not want investors to undertake activities in our countries that are prohibited in the industrialized countries just so that they can improve the profits of shareholders by creating the illusion of an allegedly less expensive product by raising the costs of environmental pollution  deteriorating health conditions and lowered life expectancy.  On a different subject  we attach high importance to our participation  together with other countries of the region  in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti. In our view  beyond the progress achieved in the transition  the steady support and economic assistance of the international community will continue to be critical in the areas of security  the strengthening of institutions  the fostering of political dialogue  the protection of human rights  social inclusion  the promotion of the rule of law  the creation of administrative capacity and  above all  the promotion of economic and social development through concrete contributions.  We reiterate here our will to achieve peaceful nuclear development under the verification of international organizations. Argentina’s commitment to disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  our adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and our long-standing practice in the field are known to all.  In conclusion  I wish to recall that the question of the Malvinas Islands — which includes the Malvinas  the South Georgias  the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime area — has been under consideration by the United Nations since 1965. The General Assembly and its Special Committee of 24 on Decolonization have defined this as a special case that differs from traditional colonial situations in that it involves a sovereignty dispute that must be resolved through bilateral negotiations between my country and the United Kingdom  in accordance with the provisions of resolution 2065 (XX) and other relevant resolutions.  We must stress that the Government of the United Kingdom persists in ignoring those General Assembly resolutions. Nonetheless  I would like to reaffirm once again my country’s readiness to engage in constructive dialogue with the United Kingdom. We call upon the United Kingdom to promptly heed the request of the international community to resume negotiations.  In conclusion  we are firmly convinced that the basis exists for international cooperation that can help the world move towards peace. The tensions and difficulties besetting humanity must not prevent us from understanding the extent to which the authoritarian notion that military might can provide unilateral solutions to conflicts and threats is starting to recede. That mistaken belief has led only to failure and great suffering.  Only multilateral solutions  reached through the arduous process of negotiation  despite their limitations  can move us forward. In this context  the United Nations has a fundamental role to play in ensuring greater understanding among nations with a view to creating a safe  peaceful and fairer world in the years to come. "
"7",262,"ARM",61,2006,"Let me congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency and wish her a year relatively free of conflict crisis and catastrophe — in other words  a year unlike the one we have just had  during which His Excellency Jan Eliasson significantly contributed to the successful navigation of troubled waters with his great leadership. The “year of turmoil”  as he called it (see A/60/PV.100)  included conflicts and crises  as well as man-made and natural disasters  all requiring our collective response. We have responded with great commitment to maintain peace and stability in the world.   Of the conflicts that we have faced in this past year  the one that emerged to be the most tragic was that of the war in Lebanon. I believe the international community has lost some credibility and moral authority in the eyes of the peoples of the world  who watched the Security Council bicker over minute issues while bombs were being dropped in Lebanon and innocent people were being killed. It was a great shame for the international community not to be able to deliver and establish an immediate ceasefire. When an international body loses moral authority  our ability to effectively tackle problems and issues that require a collective response is certainly undermined.   In other areas  however  the collective efforts of the international community have indeed succeeded. I believe we played a role in the civilized process of bringing Montenegro to this day and to this body. Collectively  we created and empowered the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council  two bodies that hold great promise for delivering deeper and more profound commitment on the part of the world community to building peace and protecting human rights.   The most threatening challenges in the world remain those of poverty and hopelessness. When our leaders gathered in this Hall six years ago  they decided that the United Nations was the most effective body in which to address the ills facing our societies. They collectively recognized their responsibility to deliver  worldwide  more equitably distributed social and economic development  at an accelerated pace. They said to the world that they were willing to channel international processes and multilateral resources in order to tackle the needs of the world’s poor. They will be judged by their adherence to the principle  promise and commitment of collective action. Six years have now passed and the world still earnestly looks on to see whether individual and regional interests can be overcome and those problems jointly addressed.  We in Armenia also face similar problems. We are encouraged and rewarded by the extensive political and economic reforms that we have conducted over the past 10 years. The results are evident. We are now preparing to engage in the second generation of political and economic reforms in order to continue to build on the past decade of progress. We are moving forward on legislative and administrative matters; we are today a more democratic society and a more open and more liberal economy. We have been registering double-digit growth over the past six years.   While we are encouraged by this economic progress and the positive macroeconomic indicators  we are now turning our attention to the rural areas in order to eradicate poverty in our society. We are reminded of the remarkable promise  made in 2000  to the victims of global poverty to “free our fellow men  women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty” (resolution 55/2  para. 11). To be able to do that in Armenia  we will leverage the philanthropy of international organizations and friendly countries with the traditional generosity of our diaspora  so that we can build and repair infrastructure and thus create new conditions for economic development and social change. But we also understand that infrastructure alone is not enough to introduce that kind of change that reduces poverty. We need to invest in people; we need to invest in women and children; and we need to educate them and train them for the future.  We will begin that programme in Armenia’s border villages. Unlike other countries  where border villages are points of interaction and activity  Armenia’s eastern and western borders are closed  thus stifling economic interaction and regional cooperation. With our neighbour  Turkey  it is not only economic cooperation that suffers  but also the dialogue between our two peoples. Turkey’s insistence on keeping the border closed and not allowing interaction between the two communities freezes the memories of yesterday  instead of promoting dialogue and interaction to create new experiences and new memories for tomorrow. We still believe and hope that Turkey will eventually understand that keeping the border closed until there is harmony and mutual understanding between our two    06-53341 8  peoples is not a policy. On the contrary  it is avoidance of a responsible policy to forge and promote regional cooperation and economic development at a time and in a region that are the object of growing global attention.  Let me address the issue of Kosovo  as many have done from this podium. We closely follow the process of self-determination in Kosovo because we Armenians  ourselves  are extremely supportive of the process of self-determination for the people of Nagorno Karabakh. But we do not draw parallels between the two conflicts or with any other conflict. We believe and insist that conflicts are all different  and each must be decided on its own merits. While we ourselves do not consider the Kosovo outcome to be a precedent for other conflicts  we are extremely anxious about the possibility that it may raise artificial obstacles for other self-determination movements  simply because others cite it as a precedent. This is of extreme concern to us because we believe that there are movements in the world today that have earned the right to self-determination. The Kosovo outcome should not serve as an excuse or reason to put a damper on those self-determination movements.  Yet  such attempts are already apparent in this Hall as the principle of self-determination is being undermined compared to other principles. But this goes contrary to the lessons of history. There is a reason that the Helsinki Final Act enshrined the principle of self-determination as equal among other principles in international relations. In international interactions  just as in human relations  there are no absolute values. There are also responsibilities. A State should gain and earn the right to govern. States have the responsibility to protect their own citizens  and the people have the right to choose the Government that they think should govern them.   The people of Nagorno Karabakh decided long ago not to be represented by the Government of Azerbaijan  because they suffered from State violence. They tried to protect themselves  and they succeeded against all odds  only to hear the State cry foul and claim sovereignty and territorial integrity. But Azerbaijan has lost every iota of the moral right to talk about guaranteeing the security of the people of Nagorno Karabakh  let alone to claim custody over that people.   Azerbaijan did not act responsibly or morally towards the people of Nagorno Karabakh  people that it considered to be its own citizens. It unleashed military action; it sanctioned pogroms and massacres in urban areas. It bombed and displaced more than 300 000 Armenians. When it lost the war and accepted a ceasefire  it began to destroy all traces of Armenians by eliminating Armenian monuments throughout the territory. Over the past two years  the remaining 2 000 carved stone crosses  representing Armenian cemeteries  were desecrated and eliminated. The territory has now been turned into a shooting range for the Azerbaijani army. This reflects the fact that Azerbaijan still does not believe in the peaceful resolution of this conflict.   Armenians cannot be blamed for thinking that Azerbaijan is not serious about a peaceful solution. Having rejected the past two offers of the international community  Azerbaijan is now concerned about being accused of rejecting the current peace plan. That is why it is manoeuvring and manipulating every possible situation — from State violence to introducing resolutions in other forums outside the peace process so that the Armenians are forced to do the rejecting.   But Armenia is clearly on record as stating that it stands by every single principle included in the document it submitted. However  in order to give a chance to that document  one cannot think or even pretend to think that there is a military option to this conflict. There is no military option. That option has been tried and has failed. The only option today is realism and compromise. The path that the people of Nagorno Karabakh have chosen over the past two decades is a path that has become irreversible. Solidifying and formalizing the process will greatly contribute to peace and stability in our region.  Karabakh is not a cause. It is an ancient place  a beautiful garden with people who have earned the right to live in peace and prosperity. That is what we seek  and we cannot accept anything less. "
"8",295,"ATG",61,2006,"Antigua and Barbuda joins other Members of the United Nations in congratulating Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Madam President  we wish you success in all your efforts and assure you of our full cooperation. I wish also to thank and congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his outstanding leadership of the sixtieth regular session of the General Assembly.  Permit me also to convey the appreciation of the Government of Antigua and Barbuda to Mr. Kofi Annan for his many years of service to the United Nations and for his overall dedication to the pursuit of world peace and development. Every year brings new and unique challenges which add to the burdens of the office of the Secretary-General  and this past year has been no exception. In bidding Mr. Annan farewell  on behalf of the Government and people of Antigua and Barbuda  I pay tribute to his indomitable courage over the past 10 years and say to him that success is never final and failure is never fatal; it is courage that counts  and he has risen to the challenge when it counted most.  Among the many accomplishments achieved in the twentieth century was the establishment of the United Nations. Among the accomplishments of the United Nations in its 60 years of existence is its advocacy of decolonization by peaceful means; its advancement of the concept of sovereignty as a natural right of all nations and all peoples; and the awareness it has brought to the international community that  in this era of globalization  the majority of humanity is afflicted not by inter-State wars but by the ravages of poverty  hunger  disease  environmental degradation and human rights violations.  We are aware of the awesome task of implementing reform measures for this Organization. We are  however  encouraged by the significant achievements made since the adoption of the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit. We are pleased that some progress has been made in areas such as the establishment of the Human Rights Council  the Central Emergency Response Fund  the launching of    06-53952 10  the Peacebuilding Commission and agreement on a counter-terrorism strategy.  Respectfully  Antigua and Barbuda joins this community of nations in underscoring the importance of social and economic development  basic human rights and their importance to the maintenance of international peace and security  mutual respect  and lasting goodwill among nations.  Slavery is today perhaps the most under-recognized crime against humanity  in spite of its consequences: the vicious displacement and brutal treatment of an entire race. Next year — 2007 — marks the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic triangular slave trade. The 14 members of the Caribbean Community  whose people are principally of African slave descent  are committed to bringing this anniversary to the attention of the world  and we look forward to members’ unanimous support in the General Assembly for our forthcoming resolution and to their joining us in the appropriate recognition of this event  which foreshadowed the abolition of slavery.  In a few weeks  on 1 November  Antigua and Barbuda will celebrate 25 years of political independence. As we take stock of our challenges and experiences in nation-building and our actions in attempting to achieve and maintain a decent standard of living for our people  our progress report is one of mixed successes and failures punctuated with hope and frustration.   The reality is that we are a politically independent small island nation with limited resources  existing in an economically interdependent yet fiercely competitive world.  Our challenges are many. But  having emerged from a past dominated by colonialism  we are indeed proud of our history as an independent democratic State where people of whatever race  creed or political affiliation are free to express and exercise all basic and fundamental human rights  which are inherent features of the United Nations legal framework. However  for a politically independent nation like ours to survive in this economically interdependent world  that requires effective multilateralism and the forging of real international partnerships. In other words  our future depends on our ability to work well with each other in a spirit of understanding and respect  given our diverse cultures  histories and economies.  Antigua and Barbuda is acutely aware of the importance of partnerships and of the necessity of working within a multilateral framework to meet the challenges we face as a young developing nation. That brings me to the importance of the United Nations in its role as a melting pot of ideas for constructive and positive action.   The United Nations development agenda is an ambitious  noble  worthy and necessary one. Were we to accomplish the goals we have set within the specified time frames  it would be a testament to the greatness of humankind. My Government and my people therefore support any process of reform of the United Nations that will enhance the level of representation in all its principal organs  increase its effectiveness and improve its legitimacy. It should be more democratic in its representation  more reflective of modern-day geopolitical realities and more timely and effective in delivering on the outcomes of its many international conferences  summits and agreements  including  of course  the Millennium Declaration.  We wholeheartedly agree with those who believe that multilateralism should not be subverted and that the United Nations framework for the peaceful resolution of international conflicts should not be undermined or replaced by unilateralist tendencies.   Additionally  in our efforts to revamp and revitalize the various development bodies of the United Nations  we should pay particular attention to the vulnerability of States. When the entire gross domestic product of a country can be wiped out by a single commonplace natural disaster  that country’s economy is most definitely vulnerable. When the economic mainstay of a country can be cut off by activities and events that occur in another country many  many miles away  that country is indeed vulnerable. When a country’s economic activity can be effectively stymied by the failure or refusal of another country to abide by international rules  accepted norms and arbitral determinations  that country’s economic prospects are certainly vulnerable. For small island States like ours  such vulnerability is our greatest insecurity.  Over the years  Antigua and Barbuda has joined the rest of the world in mourning immeasurable losses from natural disasters  be they monsoon flooding  sub-Saharan drought or Asian tsunamis. Our Caribbean subregion is particularly susceptible to the annual ravages of a hurricane season that lasts from June —   11 06-53952  which the popular ditty says is “too soon” — to October  when it just may be “all over”. My country’s Government feels that a review of existing international disaster relief funds and an increase in the amount of financial resources made available are necessary for the elimination of the sad state of the economic vulnerability of so many of our nations.  With regard to international peace and security  the Government of Antigua and Barbuda does not believe that war benefits any country — not the warrior  not the vanquished and not the passive onlooker. As leaders of nations  therefore  international peace is the greatest gift we can give to our peoples and to our children. Hence  a world where friendly diplomatic relations and dispute-solving discussions between countries are promoted is a world in which our children and grandchildren will inherit a legacy worth cherishing.   Our present-day values and our hopes for a better tomorrow have been reason enough for my country’s compliance with a significant number of United Nations-mandated anti-terrorism treaties. Terrorism breeds insecurity and exacts a severe financial burden  even on countries and communities far removed from the actual terrorist act. We join others in encouraging the Members of the United Nations to continue to deal comprehensively with the threat of terrorism by all means necessary  including the promotion of  and respect for  religious  cultural and ethnic tolerance.   We must of necessity be more responsible when we speak as influential world leaders. With the growth and development of technology  all of the world is a stage in a manner that William Shakespeare never foresaw. It therefore behoves us all to constantly and continuously mind our exits and our entrances and the many parts that we play on the global stage.  Today we join a list of countries that have time and again in these hallowed halls repeated the clarion call for greater action by the international community to realize the laudable objectives and full intentions of the United Nations Charter in the areas of meaningful development financing and the concept of fair trade. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was correct politically when he said a few days ago from this very rostrum that “the ‘global partnership for development’ is still more a phrase than fact — especially in the all-important area of trade” ().   Too often we have taken corrective steps at home on the domestic level to create  in the jargon of the United Nations  an enabling environment. Yet we see little or no real or tangible results  because developed countries do not deliver on their commitments but continue  in spite of their rhetoric  to support or continue systematic imbalances in the international trading system.  Antigua and Barbuda  in spite of its limited resources and its highly vulnerable economy  has embarked upon a strategy of economic diversification guided by the rules and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Yet  unfortunately  even as we play by those rules  the unfair trading practices of some of our international partners threaten to diminish the modest economic gains that we have made in recent times. We need to ask ourselves  are we really serious about raising standards in the developing world? Are we really serious about sustainable development?  Rest assured that in spite of the continuing rhetoric  we in Antigua and Barbuda will continue our efforts to achieve a high standard of living and improved economic and social well-being for our 80 000 people. We will continue to partner with our sister countries within the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and Caribbean Community subregional groupings. We will continue our advocacy for good environmental stewardship and the advancement of the fundamentals of sustainable development at home  in our region and beyond. In addition  we will continue to insist on nationally owned development strategies as we seek deeper North-South and South-South cooperation for more meaningful  tangible and lasting economic development.

"9",342,"AUS",61,2006,"I would like to begin by joining with my colleagues in congratulating Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am also delighted to welcome Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United Nations.   I also note that this will be the tenth and  indeed  the final General Assembly for the Secretary-General. I want to congratulate him on his important contribution to the United Nations over his term and also throughout his United Nations career. He has been a very good colleague of Australia throughout that time. He has been a determined advocate for peace  development and United Nations reform  and we wish him well in the future.  Earlier this month  on the day before the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks against the United States  a man called Hakim Taniwal was murdered by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan.  Mr. Taniwal was the Governor of Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan. He was a scholarly  gentle-spoken man of integrity — a good man  with a reputation as a highly capable administrator. As well as being an Afghani  Mr. Taniwal was an Australian. He lived in exile in my country for some years and built a new life for his family.  But when Afghanistan was liberated from the Taliban in the wake of 9/11  Mr. Taniwal returned to help rebuild his homeland. He worked for the betterment of his fellow Afghans by adopting a forward-looking model of public administration  far removed from the Taliban narrative of rule by fear. For his trouble  the Taliban had him killed. His nephew died alongside him. A few days later  compounding atrocity upon atrocity  a second suicide bomber attacked Mr. Taniwal’s funeral ceremony  killing and injuring many more people.  The task of rebuilding Afghanistan  in the face of such atrocities  is demanding great sacrifices on the part of tens of thousands of brave men and women. It is a country in which many of the great challenges of our time intersect: how to free its cities  towns and villages from the daily threat of violence; how to ensure that an extremist ideology never again subjugates the country’s institutions; and how to create the conditions for stability and good governance so necessary to economic renewal and so crucial if its people are to escape poverty and oppression.  Afghanistan represents a fundamental test for each of us. If we are not resolute and steadfast in supporting Afghanistan against the scourge of terrorism  and if we are not prepared collectively to stand up against the extremists  we will deliver to coming generations a weak international system and a far less secure and stable world.  Iraq is another of the front lines in this battle. I acknowledge here the divided views of United Nations Member States over the military action against the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003  yet today there is a very clear choice that should unite us all.  The extremists have chosen to make Iraq a battleground. Osama bin Laden has said that Iraq is “for you or for us to win”. We know what will come of Iraq if it is won by the extremists. As in Afghanistan  we must all commit to securing its future. Iraq is not America’s burden alone  and Afghanistan is not NATO’s burden alone  because if terrorism prevailed  the consequences would be catastrophic for each of us  wherever we may live.  This struggle will be protracted. Our challenge is not just to keep our citizens safe from terrorist attack; it is also to defeat an ideology that allows for no ideas or belief systems other than its own. It is imperative we see this ideology clearly for what it is: a mindset every bit as brutal and uncompromising as its totalitarian predecessors in centuries past. It is an ideology that    06-53005 34  directly challenges the principles and values of modernity — the flourishing of open markets  open societies and open minds. To defeat this evil  we must harness the collective strength of the international community.  I welcome the recent agreement on the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  but I am disappointed that the Strategy’s illustrative list of conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism did not include extremist ideologies.  Ms. Grabar-Kitarovic (Croatia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  We need to do much more. States should conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. That would demonstrate an unambiguous commitment  ensuring that all terrorist acts are criminalized in international law. It is disappointing that the United Nations still cannot agree on the scope of such a convention.  More disturbingly  some countries continue to sponsor terrorist groups to promote their own political agendas. In the Middle East  it is essential that all countries  including Iran and Syria  use their influence over organizations such as Hezbollah to stop terrorist assaults  including those directed at the State of Israel. Any viable resolution of the conflict must include Hezbollah’s disarmament  its renunciation of violence and a recognition of Israel’s right to exist in peace.  In all of this  the United Nations has a role to play. But  as I have said before in this Hall  the United Nations is not the answer to all the problems of the world. Where the United Nations cannot act  individual States must. Our membership in the United Nations does not absolve any of us from the responsibility to show leadership and to pursue practical solutions.  Too often in the world of politics  the temptation is for Governments to strike an attitude and then leave the substantive action for another day  or to offload the responsibility onto others. We can make solemn pledges — as we should  and we do — to work much harder to assist developing nations in confronting the ravages of poverty and disease. We can sign high-minded manifestos to protect our environment from the risk of climate change. Alongside global security  these are two issues crucial to our collective future. But so much of the talk is mere artifice unless backed up by resolute  practical and well-constructed policy responses.  In Australia’s region  practical and effective cooperation has exemplified the counter-terrorism response. A regional training centre jointly established by Indonesia and Australia is helping South-East Asian law enforcement agencies develop the capabilities they need to destroy terrorist networks. Other recent initiatives  such as interfaith dialogues  are promoting tolerance and mutual understanding.  Practical and effective cooperation has also been the hallmark of our commitment to East Timor. Australian Defence Force personnel and police worked with their counterparts from New Zealand  Malaysia and Portugal to restore order after the April riots. We remain ready to continue to provide a significant “green helmet” military contingent in East Timor to complement the United Nations police force mandated under Security Council resolution 1704 (2006).  Elsewhere in our region  Australia has joined in a partnership with 14 other Pacific countries in a Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). RAMSI is not just about restoring law and order; some 150 advisers are working with the Solomon Islands Government  helping to stabilize finances  revitalize the public service and strengthen the justice and prison systems. None of these tasks is easy  and much more remains to be done  but the hard work has begun  and we are making headway.  In contrast  the tragedy of Darfur poses a grievous challenge to the international community. Darfur is a litmus test of the responsibility of the United Nations to help people who desperately need its protection. It is a test of the most basic principles of civilization. We all know this. We also know it is a test that  so far  the United Nations has failed.  In this Hall last year  we assumed a solemn responsibility to protect those who have no means of protecting themselves. The United Nations itself must now redouble its efforts to try to prevent any further bloodshed in Darfur  which has already claimed well in excess of 200 000 lives and brought about the displacement of millions of persons. The United Nations must keep its promise to the people of Darfur. It is no less than they should expect and no less than we would demand.   35 06-53005   The desperation of Darfur reminds us also of the immense challenges of development. Members of the United Nations have recognized this through the Millennium Development Goals. Aid is important  and last year Australia committed itself to doubling our annual aid budget to about $4 billion a year by 2010. Australia has recently sharpened the focus of our development assistance programme on supporting good governance  basic social services and security in developing countries. In the South Pacific  we will sponsor new programmes to train people in technical and entrepreneurial skills.   But increasing aid and reducing debt burdens alone will not reduce poverty. Economic growth is central to poverty alleviation. The World Bank estimates that the number of people living on less than $2 a day in East Asia fell by around 280 million between 2001 and 2005. The policies and actions of developing countries in creating an enabling environment for economic growth are fundamental to advances on this front. Likewise  free and open trade and investment are pivotal. The failure of the Doha Round of multilateral trade talks would be a cruel rebuff to the world’s poor. The World Bank estimates that a strong outcome of the Round could lift an additional 32 million people out of poverty by 2015.  We cannot underpin sustainable economic development without protecting the environment on which we depend. Biodiversity loss  land clearing  deforestation and climate change present threats to the common good that can best be overcome through collective action.  But collective action entails much more than adopting resolutions and signing treaties. Fine words and high aspirations may give us a sense that we are acting to stop environmental degradation  but they are of little benefit unless backed by practical action. Domestic implementation of environmental commitments has not been sufficient  and the gap between words and action remains too wide.  Climate change is an area where we must move beyond blind faith in a single multilateral approach. The great challenge is to address climate change without jeopardizing economic growth  particularly in developing countries. We need to work towards a more inclusive and effective international approach to climate change. The existing efforts are not enough; we need to bring forward new ideas  not constrained by ideology.   The focus of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is the development and transfer of cleaner energy-generating technologies. The Partnership brings together Australia  the United States  Japan  China  India and the Republic of Korea. Together  those countries account for about half of the world’s gross domestic product  population  energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of the Partnership is to bring developed and developing countries together with the private sector to deploy technologies — be they renewable energy or carbon storage — to help reduce the dangers of climate change  while not stalling economic growth and development.  Effective international action on the great global challenges of our time requires more than resolutions at the United Nations. It requires the exercise of strong leadership by individual nations. It requires proactive policy  not political posturing or personal abuse from this rostrum. It requires a rigorous search for sound and practical long-term solutions.  As Members of the United Nations  we have pledged to unite our strengths to maintain international peace and security. But  equally  we cannot abrogate to the United Nations the responsibility that we have  as individual States  for security and good governance within our borders and within our regions. History will judge us harshly if we do not shoulder that responsibility. "
"10",389,"AUT",61,2006,"“United in diversity”: this motto of the European Union expresses what we  the 25 — and soon to be 27 — member States of the European Union  demand from ourselves  as well as our aspirations for the United Nations. “United in diversity” is also a concrete management principle of our practical  everyday work to promote justice  peace  freedom and prosperity. As the host country to the only United Nations headquarters within the European Union  as President of the European Union during the first six months of 2006 and as a venue for the dialogue of religions and cultures  Austria has consistently aimed at translating this principle into practice  including by providing peacekeepers  despite recent    06-53005 36  bitter experiences such as the tragic death of Major Hans-Peter Lang while he was serving the United Nations in southern Lebanon.  By establishing the Human Rights Council in Geneva and the Peacebuilding Commission  we have given ourselves new instruments for carrying out an important part of our work in this phase of United Nations reform. Austria thanks Jan Eliasson  President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  for his vision  tenacity and endurance. We owe it to his negotiating skills that institutional reform of the United Nations has been decisively set in motion. We pledge to devote the necessary determination to the reform measures that still need to be implemented  such as management reform  the review of United Nations mandates and the establishment of a rule of law assistance unit.  Today  after decades of division  Europe is growing together again. That is the major achievement of the European Union. We have come a long way. The iron curtain is a relic of the past. Today  we want the countries of South-East Europe and the Balkans to take their rightful place in Europe and to be included in the reunification process of our continent. The European experience is  profoundly  an experience of overcoming old and bitter conflicts and of the power of patient and peaceful transformation.   Here  I wish to welcome to the General Assembly the newest European member and the 192nd Member of the United Nations  the Republic of Montenegro.  In Europe  difficult issues need to be solved. Tomorrow  the Security Council will discuss the future status of Kosovo. Austria supports the efforts of President Martti Ahtisaari and his team in Vienna. As neighbours and friends  we urge both Belgrade and Pristina to engage in these negotiations constructively  in a results-oriented manner and with the necessary sense of realism. Our goal is a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo whose citizens can all live in security and dignity on the basis of mutual trust. In the same spirit  a confident  peaceful and prosperous Serbia  fully integrated into the family of European nations  is crucial for the stability of the whole region.  In the Middle East  innocent civilians still suffer from the disastrous consequences of terror attacks and the indiscriminate use of force. Men  women and children on all sides must be given a real chance to live in peace and in an atmosphere of increasing mutual trust.   The goal that Austria pursues in its relations with the Middle East is to realize the vision of Palestinians and Israelis living side by side in security as neighbours in two States  working towards a peaceful and economically successful common future. We know that the path towards that goal is rocky  but now we have reached a turning point. In the aftermath of the armed conflict in Lebanon  all parties in the region have agreed on the need for renewed engagement on the part of the international community. The European Union and its member States can and will make a substantive contribution.   However  international efforts can only support — not serve as a substitute for — efforts by Israel and the Palestinians. That is why we welcome the efforts of President Abbas to form a Government of national unity in the Palestinian territories and the recent high-level  direct contacts. Yesterday’s statement by the Middle East Quartet — in which the United Nations plays such a central role — is another encouraging signal. We hope that those decisions will help to alleviate the plight of the Palestinian people and to move the political process forward.  Austria is convinced that the work of the Middle East Quartet should now pave the way towards a major peace initiative. We see great merit in an international Middle East conference along the lines of the 1991 Madrid Conference. We believe that such a forum should be open to regional partners willing to participate constructively in search of a comprehensive peace settlement. A conference of that kind could also examine the longer-term potential for regional security arrangements.  As the Secretary-General has rightly pointed out  Africa must remain one of our main priorities. In particular  we must engage to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Darfur. It is simply unacceptable that not even relief agencies are given access to help those most in need. It is deeply disturbing that there is no clear perspective for an end to fighting and suffering in the region. As many others  we urgently call upon the Government of the Sudan to accept the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur without delay.  Austria is deeply aware of the need for the dialogue of cultures and religions. This is because my   37 06-53005  country lies at the crossroads of many different cultures  at the heart of a continent marked by centuries of dividing lines. Our own difficult experience has certainly taught us that mutual tolerance and respect are universal values  which we must all uphold and that religious beliefs  by their very nature  must never be misused to justify violence.   In view of our own experience  we are also convinced that the dialogue of religions and cultures is not a challenge confined only to the international field; this dialogue begins at home  within our own societies. Here  as well as at the global level  “United in diversity” must be our guiding principle. We have to keep our work down to earth. We have to find answers on how best to organize living together and provide orientation in a rapidly globalizing world that many regard as a menace. Ultimately  it is in the work place  at school  in defining the role of women in society  in seeking to create opportunities for young people and in the media that we decide about the outcome of the dialogue of cultures in real-life terms.  I am therefore convinced that we must better integrate the dialogue of religions and cultures in the everyday work of the United Nations. This is a topic that we cannot leave to the street. The minefield of collective emotions is not a good place to discuss questions of belief. Complex feelings of frustration  humiliation and neglect can erupt in violence at the slightest trigger. In a world where connections are established by a single mouse click  reactions arrive within minutes. Here  we need to counteract on the basis of our common values  in full conformity with universal human rights and basic freedoms  as they are the very foundation of our work here at the United Nations.  In the 61 years of the United Nations  this is only the third time that a woman has presided over the General Assembly  and the first woman to do so coming from the Arab world. While we congratulate her personally on her election to this high position  Austria also regards this election as a signal to all women in the world: the time has come for women to take their rightful place in all spheres of public life. We are called upon to engage politically at all levels  from the community level to the United Nations. The voices of women need to be heard more clearly in the work of the United Nations. Women know what holds families  communities and societies together. This age-old knowledge in all its modern variety and colour should not be left untapped  in particular in peace processes. In United Nations missions  at the negotiation table  in decision-making processes and not only as voices in the background. During its presidency of the European Union  Austria  in its recruitment strategy  consistently aimed at deploying women in European Union peace missions. In addition  we elaborated guidelines for European Union missions on how to best comply with the special needs of children.  In his address to the General Assembly at its 10th meeting  on 19 September  the Secretary-General rightly said  “It is shameful that last year’s Summit Outcome does not contain even one word about non-proliferation and disarmament”. Austria calls for a renewed commitment of the international community to these security goals. We also offer to host the next preparatory meeting for the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in Vienna in the spring of 2007.  Development and the preservation of our livelihoods require sustainable solutions. Among the great global challenges we are facing is climate change. Global warming is real. Austria is committed to do her part in combating it. However  in Austria’s view  nuclear energy is not the right answer; it bears too many risks and uncertainties to be regarded as a safe and sustainable source of energy.  Solidarity is at the heart of the United Nations: solidarity with the poor  the weak and the powerless. Here  the United Nations task list for the coming years is rich with promise: achieving the Millennium Development Goals in full  concluding the Doha Development Round  fighting against hunger  disease  poverty and exclusion.  On Tuesday  we launched the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy with a clear message: the international community is united against this scourge of humanity. We will not tolerate terrorism in any form or manifestation. And we will redouble our efforts to dry up the breeding grounds from which terrorism feeds itself. Let me in this context point out the excellent work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna  with its Global Programme against Terrorism  in delivering technical assistance to Member States.  It is out of respect for diversity and in recognition of the need for unity that Austria has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security    06-53005 38  Council for the period 2009-2010. With this in mind  we have made the rule of law the backbone of our candidature.  Let me close by conveying Austria’s appreciation for the great personality who has been standing at the helm of this Organization for the past decade  for Kofi Annan  the statesman and the person. We thank the Secretary-General  in particular for being a tireless encourager  despite the considerable obstacles he has had to face at times. He is a role model for dignity and confidence. He is always ready to speak out  in his soft but firm voice  for those whose voices are not strong enough or loud enough to be heard; to give voice to the weak  the poor  the small and those who feel lost or abandoned. Mr. Secretary-General  the world will continue listening to your voice as it is the voice of hope and steadfastness. "
"11",414,"AZE",61,2006,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly and wish her every success during her tenure.  I would like also to extend my sincere thanks to her predecessor  my good friend Mr. Jan Eliasson  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden  for his efforts and active work with the delegations throughout the last session.  The 2005 High-level Plenary Meeting of the Assembly became an important milestone in the history of the United Nations. It reaffirmed our faith in the Organization and our unwavering interest to make it stronger and effective. I am pleased to emphasize the positive moves that we have made since last September on issues such as development  the environment  HIV/AIDS  Secretariat reform  establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund and the Peacebuilding Fund.   The founding of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council are remarkable moments in the history of the United Nations. Yet more remains to be done to realize our common vision of solidarity and collective security  which is premised on the shared values and principles of the Charter.  As we move towards such ambitious goals  it is increasingly apparent that multilateralism with a strong United Nations at its core remains the only reliable instrument for maintaining international peace and security  achieving sustainable development and promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Strengthening the deliberative and decision-making authority of the General Assembly  which represents the views of all Member States  is key to the successful implementation and effectiveness of the reforms.  Azerbaijan believes that reform of the Security Council should not be confined to enlargement of its membership. We stand for the rationalization of the Council’s working methods  greater transparency in decision-making  accountability in performance and full implementation of its resolutions.  The election of the new Secretary-General is an event of the utmost importance for the Organization. It has already been revealed to suffer from a number of deficiencies and requires greater transparency and inclusion of the wider membership. Azerbaijan believes that the new head of the United Nations should clearly recognize the trends and challenges faced by the international community at the beginning of the twenty-first century.  Azerbaijan regrets that the late response of the Security Council to the evolving crisis in the Middle East allowed the humanitarian tragedy to unfold. In that regard  implementation of the measures contained in Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  including those related to the Lebanese Government’s seven-point peace plan  is very important for bringing durable peace to the Middle East. Azerbaijan will continue its efforts to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the conflict and alleviate the sufferings of civilians in Lebanon.  I would like to express profound support for the States that have fallen victim to terrorist attacks. While strongly condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and reaffirming our commitment to jointly fight that global scourge  we register our serious concern over attempts to link terrorism to the Islamic religion  culture or people.  There is a dire need to stop and reverse a growing tendency towards Islamophobia in the world. Azerbaijan  in its capacity as Chairman of the Ministerial Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) calls upon Member States to undertake concrete measures to enhance dialogue and   21 06-53341  broaden understanding among nations  cultures and religions by promoting tolerance and respect for freedom of religion and belief. It is of vital importance to raise public awareness about the tenets and values of Islam worldwide  including in the Muslim societies. To that end  we plan to host in Baku in 2007  under the aegis of the OIC  an international conference on the role of the mass media in developing tolerance and mutual understanding.  The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan has recently become a subject of urgent consideration by the General Assembly  due to the massive fires occurring in those territories. The Assembly adopted without a vote a resolution stressing the necessity to conduct an urgent environmental operation with a view to suppressing the fires  overcoming their detrimental impact and rehabilitating the affected territories. The resolution has a two-fold purpose. On the one hand  it envisages a number of practical steps  including an assessment of the short- and long-term impact of the fires on the environment as a step in preparation for the environmental operation  counteracting the environmental degradation of the region  and the rehabilitation of the fire-affected part of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. On the other  it serves as an unprecedented example of engaging the parties to the conflict  particularly Armenia and Azerbaijan  in a joint environmental operation to be carried out directly in the fire-affected zone. The implementation of the resolution will contribute to establishing an atmosphere of trust and confidence and will give positive impetus to the negotiation process.  Sadly  that is the only positive development so far and cannot be attributed to the overall situation concerning the settlement process. Although no substantial progress has been registered so far  the parties and mediators have accepted the stage-by-stage approach in the settlement process as the only possible option. Basically  there are two main issues on which the parties disagree — the definition of the status of self-rule for the population of the occupied Nagorny Karabakh region and the withdrawal of Armenian forces from all the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.  There is a common understanding that the status cannot be defined today. It should be elaborated through a peaceful  democratic and legal process with the direct participation and consent of both Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the Nagorny Karabakh region. To that end  the Armenian occupying forces have to withdraw from the occupied territories and the necessary conditions have to be in place to allow the secure and dignified return of the indigenous Azerbaijani displaced persons to the Nagorny Karabakh region and the surrounding territories of Azerbaijan.  Such a logical chain of events will establish the necessary conditions for the next stage of the settlement  which is normalizing life in the conflict-affected area  restoring intercommunal relations  launching socio-economic development and considering appropriate models of self-rule for the entire population of the region within Azerbaijan.  Our position is based on relevant resolutions of the Security Council and decisions of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  which unequivocally demand the unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from all occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan  the restoration of its sovereignty and territorial integrity  the creation of favourable conditions for the safe return of the civilian population  the restoration of intercommunal relations  and the elaboration of the status of self-government within a democratic and legal process  based on the agreement of both communities of the region.  It is difficult to hope for a breakthrough in the negotiations when Armenia rejects face-to-face meetings and refuses to take a constructive approach to solving existing problems. What is more worrisome is that Armenia is attempting to support by all available means the separatist regime established under its control in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan and to spread myths and legends about the historical past and the alleged democratic and economic achievements of the regime. As a matter of fact  the reality on the ground proves the opposite. The Armenian community  which is the only remaining part of the entire population of the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan  is increasingly inclined to leave the unrecognized quasi-entity due to worsening living conditions and the lack of any prospect of economic and social development.  The dynamics of development of the entire region are strikingly evident  and in five or 10 years the economic growth of the region vis-à-vis Armenia will be much more impressive. It could be given a chance to join ongoing regional and transnational projects  but    06-53341 22  prior to that Yerevan has to take a number of steps to establish normal relations with its neighbours.  The first plenary meetings of the Assembly under the presidency of Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa were marked by an extremely difficult debate over an issue that was procedural in nature  but had a substantial political bearing. I join my colleagues from the States members of the Georgia  Ukraine  Azerbaijan  Moldova Organization for Democracy and Economic Development (GUAM) in commending her wisdom and efforts aimed at ensuring that the rules of this house serve the interests of all Member States. Procedural disadvantages should not constrain the Member States from bringing critical issues affecting their security to the attention of the Assembly.  The GUAM heads of State  in their Joint Declaration on the issue of conflict settlement  called upon States and international organizations to further facilitate  within their competence  conflict settlement processes in the GUAM area. Therefore  the inclusion of the new item on conflicts in the GUAM area in the agenda of the General Assembly is an attempt to raise the awareness of the Assembly of dangerous developments emerging from those unresolved conflicts.  The pledges we have made to promote better standards of living in larger freedom nourish the faith of people around the world in future positive change and development. Hence  there is no greater imperative than to fulfil the development agenda and to strengthen global partnership for development.  Azerbaijan is convinced that national development strategies should be a principal framework of development cooperation and support. Efficiency in the implementation process cannot be achieved unless it employs measures targeted at increasing the self-sufficiency of countries in the long run  inter alia  through knowledge  capacity-building  infrastructure development and market access and  ultimately  by reducing their dependence on foreign aid. A favourable global economic situation remains a prerequisite for the success of national development strategies  macroeconomic policies and  eventually  the economic and financial stability and growth of countries.  Azerbaijan believes that international organizations should support the efforts of countries to improve and sustain their economic performance. We look forward to the contribution of the United Nations with a stronger and more effective Economic and Social Council capable of effectively discharging its newly assigned functions.  Let me now describe the economic outlook for Azerbaijan and its experience in enhancing growth  development and social well-being. In the light of trends in 2005  gross domestic product is expected to increase by 30.5 per cent in 2006  driven by oil and gas production and exports. In 2006  State spending has been increased by up to 65 per cent  a large proportion being spent on the public sector and infrastructure. The key challenge facing the Government is to create a favourable environment for investment in the non-oil sector and to diversify exports. To achieve this objective  it must keep domestic reforms on track and strive to strengthen the business environment.  The year 2006 marked a historic moment for the region and beyond  with the official inauguration of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline. We are looking forward to completion of the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum natural gas pipeline this fall and remain committed to contributing to global energy security. At the same time  we are actively developing transregional infrastructure projects  in particular the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad  which has been recognized as an important addition to the East-West and North-South transportation corridors.  Last but not least  the establishment of the Human Rights Council marked a critical step towards enhancing the universal system for promoting and protecting human rights worldwide. The Council has been endowed with the necessary mandate to give human rights the central role foreseen by the Charter  and its status is that of a subsidiary body of the General Assembly. We have to build effective mechanisms  such as universal periodic review  special procedures and a complaints procedure within the Council. As a newly elected member of the Human Rights Council  Azerbaijan reiterates its readiness to cooperate with other Member States in order to ensure that the new Council becomes an effective body guided by the principles of universality  objectivity and non-selectivity and that it bases its activity on constructive and transparent dialogue and cooperation.

"12",460,"BDI",61,2006,"It is a great honour and pleasure to speak here on behalf of my delegation and to take part in this important gathering  where all the Member States of our Organization will consider today’s most pressing issues.  I wish to express to the President  on behalf of my delegation and in my own name  our warmest congratulations on her election. We also congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson on the effective way in which he led the work of the previous session.  We also take this opportunity to express once again my country’s support for  and appreciation of  the excellent work of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has led our Organization with courage  lucidity and determination during his term of office.  Burundi is taking part in the sixty-first session of the General Assembly a year after the setting up of democratic institutions. It was a historic event in Burundi for us to have democratically elected institutions  which have just reached the end of their first year in office  the first time this has happened since we gained independence.  This is a good time for us to report to the Assembly on the political  social and economic situation in our country and the efforts that have been made to meet the many challenges that the people of Burundi face. It is also an opportunity for us to address some of the issues of current concern at the regional and global levels.  In the post-conflict situation that my country is going through  the first concern was to re-establish peace and security throughout the country. Carrying out this task was made possible thanks to the deployment in Burundi of a United Nations force and the training of a new national defence force  in accordance with the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi and the Comprehensive Ceasefire Agreement of Pretoria. So far  this integration has proceeded uneventfully  and we thank God for this.  The signing of a comprehensive ceasefire on 7 September 2006 by the Government and the last rebel movement  the Palipehutu-FNL movement  encourages us to accelerate the programme for disarming civilians in order to establish peace and security throughout the country. Over the last three months the people have begun to voluntarily hand in to the authorities weapons they acquired during Burundi’s crisis. So far about 5 000 weapons have been handed over. The agreement represents a very important stage in the life of our country  which is now going through its reconstruction phase.   The enjoyment of political liberties has become a reality in Burundi  whether in terms of political parties  civil society or the media. With regard to the media  a law has just been passed to create more diverse and more professional press institutions.  We have also just passed an anti-corruption law. Measures to implement it include an anti-corruption court and a force to deal with corruption. We are convinced that they will allow us to work with more transparency in the management of public resources and in our fight against corruption. State income is increasing by nearly 20 per cent each month; we are already enjoying the benefits of this policy.    06-52988 16   With regard to promoting the rule of law and the rights of the individual  we are making progress through the reforms taking place in the justice sector and with regard to human rights  national solidarity and gender equality. The Burundi Government’s programme has placed promoting the rights of women and gender equality amongst its priorities. We urge the United Nations to give particular attention to this issue during its reform process. The Government also appeals for  and supports  a specific structure to ensure that women emerge from poverty and thus have genuine equality.  Still with regard to the rule of law  in addition to the 5 000 or more political prisoners already freed  on the occasion of the celebration of the forty-fourth anniversary of national independence on 1 July this year  we decided to release undocumented detainees being held under irregular circumstances. Similarly  the Government has started to improve conditions for prisoners who have been properly sentenced. However  we are aware that much more needs to be done in this area  with the support of the international community.  Establishing the rule of law and peacebuilding also depend on the peaceful settlement of the issue of land ownership. This was behind the Government’s creation of the national commission dealing with land and other assets  whose task it is to settle disputes over the ownership or recovery of land and other assets that have changed hands during the various social and political conflicts in our history. Its work is an essential complement to that of the truth and reconciliation commission  with regard to which the Government of Burundi hopes agreement will soon be reached with the United Nations  because we are convinced that it will contribute to combating the fallout from genocide  as well as impunity in our country  and enhance the national reconciliation process.  With regard to national reconciliation  we firmly believe that sport is a very important factor in peacebuilding and reconstruction and in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In Burundi we have taken measures in this area  and we hope that other countries going through a post-conflict period will follow our example.  The Government of Burundi continues to have to deal with a significant number of vulnerable people. We have today nearly 400 000 refugees  120 000 internally displaced persons and thousands of others who need to be cared for  including persons with disabilities  orphans  widows  widowers and old people unsettled by the war. Our Government needs help to deal with this situation. Since the recent ceasefire agreement  refugees have started to return to Burundi en masse.  The Government of Burundi has also sought to improve the country’s socio-economic situation. Aware of the general impoverishment of our people due to a decade of war  we prepared an emergency programme for the current year  and submitted it to donors for funding on 28 February. The programme covers in particular free primary education for all children of school age  counteracting hunger  access to health care  job creation  rehabilitation of the communication infrastructure  improving prison conditions and improving the management of public finances.  In order to ensure the proper management of funds provided by donors within the framework of cooperation with Burundi  the Government has established a national committee to coordinate aid. With the same desire for efficiency  we have created a national committee to monitor and manage Heavily Indebted Poor Countries funds  budgetary support and debt.  The Government’s efforts to alleviate poverty include measures such as reducing the price of most essential commodities  the abolition of some taxes  free health care for children under the age of five and for mothers who give birth in state clinics  and the fight against AIDS. A new status for civil servants and a 15 per cent increase in their salary from 1 July this year are intended to give them more motivation and halt the decline in their standard of living.  However  our country’s reconstruction  efforts to counteract poverty and the relaunching of Burundi’s economy require more than an emergency programme. The preparation of a strategic framework for growth and counteracting poverty  covering a period of three years  meets this concern. We plan to organize next November a donors’ round table on the basis of this strategic framework. We rely on the active participation of Burundi’s partners  both long-standing partners and new ones  in order to help Burundi respond positively to the many priority expectations of our people  who are impatient to enjoy the dividends of peace at last.   17 06-52988   At the same time  we are pursuing or launching other measures aimed at creating a favourable economic environment that is conducive to prosperity. They include liberalizing the coffee sector  simplifying customs procedures  liberalizing the circulation of currency through private financial institutions  constructing new communication routes and improving the road network. Furthermore  the investment code has been revised in order to encourage investment in Burundi.  The Government’s adoption of the five-year plan for 2006-2010 and the launching of a study for the period to 2025 are part of this medium- and long-term strategy for our socio-economic and political development. We have thus sought to establish for our society a plan based on a minimum number of common objectives and a shared vision of the future of Burundi and its people.  We welcome the decision by the American Administration to put Burundi on the list of countries that benefit from the facilities offered in the framework of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. We have invited businessmen to organize themselves in order to take advantage of this new opportunity for our economy.  Burundi attaches great importance to regional integration initiatives. We take this opportunity to welcome the electoral process taking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which is now in its final stages. We hope that it will be successful and that it will result in the democratic establishment of legitimate institutions. Similarly  we welcome the signing of a ceasefire between the Government of Uganda and the LRA  which we sincerely hope will quickly lead to lasting peace.  We continue to be concerned over the continuing armed conflict in the Horn of Africa  Darfur and the Middle East  as well as by the deadlock in the peace process in Côte d’Ivoire. As Members of the United Nations  we must work tirelessly to end these sad situations.  Terrorism is a further harsh reality that the world still confronts. Far from being discouraged  we must step up our vigilance and consider new initiatives to counteract this scourge and evil  and to deal with its underlying causes.  Globalization is one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century  but we also see it as an opportunity for developing countries to benefit from the considerable progress and advantages that it offers  provided it is combined with openness and autonomy.  For our part  we will spare no effort to make our contribution to building peace and prosperity. The election of Burundi to the Peacebuilding Commission is a source of pride and additional motivation to work to strengthen peace in our country and throughout the world. Unfortunately  changes in anti-democratic thinking and behaviour do not take place automatically in countries emerging from crisis  such as Burundi. However  we welcome the successes already achieved and our increased capacity to control the situation.  Our Organization is going through a critical period. Although the United Nations was set up “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”  certain conflict situations have been haunting it for many years. It must therefore be made into an instrument at the service of all  able to inspire hope  dispel concerns and restore respect for order and international law. This mission must be fulfilled in full cooperation with regional organizations  whose effectiveness in conflict prevention and rapid intervention has already been proved  despite insufficient resources.  The General Assembly’s agenda must reflect the main concerns of the day. These include  in particular  nuclear disarmament  which continues to poison international relations. Other concerns are combating the illegal trade in small arms  poverty and epidemics that kill on a large scale  such as AIDS and malaria. We commend the international drug purchasing facility (UNITAID) initiative  which gives hope to those suffering from AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria. It proves that a partnership between the North and the South can change the lives of millions of people throughout the world.  The new millennium was warmly welcomed. World leaders place great hopes in this new time  as shown by the Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000  which were reaffirmed in the declaration of the summit of heads of State and Government in September 2005. Those Goals represent a platform that is particularly important for developing countries  landlocked countries and small island developing States in their efforts to combat hunger and poverty    06-52988 18  and to promote health and education  to mention just a few subjects.  Other commitments were made in Paris and at the G-8 summit in Gleneagles  particularly for improved aid coordination and further aid and debt relief.  Before closing  I would like to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  and to all the members of the Security Council  the European Union and the African Union  as well as to all the members of the Regional Initiative that have supported our peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts  which have resulted in the achievements already seen. We think in particular of certain countries of the region  such as Uganda  Tanzania and South Africa  which were tireless godfathers in facilitating our peace process. To all those partners  we again say a big “Thank you” for the remarkable success that my country has just witnessed with the signing of the ceasefire with the Palipehutu-FNL. "
"13",507,"BEL",61,2006,"Just one year ago  our heads of State or Government gathered in this Assembly and reaffirmed that peace  security  development and human rights are closely interlinked. They also reaffirmed their faith in multilateralism and an international order based upon the rule of law. The mandate they entrusted to us is being implemented progressively. We have established the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council and adopted the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Our expectations are high and we hope that the results will meet them.  During the past year  we have witnessed a rebirth of multilateralism  and I am happy about that. What we  the Member States of the United Nations  do together in a multilateral way will by definition enjoy greater legitimacy. I have in mind in particular  the recent conflict between Israel and Lebanon  a conflict in which the Security Council fully assumed its responsibilities — and of which the good offices of the Secretary-General must eventually guarantee a lasting political settlement.   Likewise  it is worth noting that international dialogue  rather than the use of force  is again in the foreground of multilateral diplomacy. Here I have in mind the case of Iran: we must make every effort to resolve the difficult nuclear issue while fully respecting the principles of the Charter and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).  That being said  multilateralism  as I see it  is neither a dogma nor a simple profession of faith. Multilateralism is an instrument that should be judged by its impact on world issues. In order to be effective  it must deliver results. Only action can legitimize its raison d’être.  Yesterday morning the President of Finland addressed the General Assembly on behalf of the European Union (see ). I entirely endorse her statement. I will now address a few issues which are of particular importance to Belgium.  The Middle East has just experienced one of the worst crises in recent years. A military approach has led to unacceptable sacrifices by civilians  both in Lebanon and in Israel. In the face of such a crisis  Belgium and its European partners have clearly demonstrated their willingness to act and have answered the successive appeals of the Secretary-General. Belgium  for its part  has contributed to the emergency fund to support the Lebanese Government’s reconstruction projects. But above all  Belgium has decided to participate in the reinforcement of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  requested by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). In the coming weeks  400 Belgian Blue Helmets will be deployed in southern Lebanon.   But the international community’s efforts must not stop there. All elements of the Security Council resolution must be urgently implemented. I salute the efforts of the Secretary-General and of the States involved  which have brought an end to the blockade. The two kidnapped Israeli soldiers must also be immediately released. Likewise  we have to work on a solution for the release of the Lebanese prisoners in Israel. And above all  the arms embargo must effectively be implemented. Finally  the Lebanese Government must fully exercise its sovereignty and its control throughout its territory. It has our full support in that process.  The implementation of Council resolution 1701 (2006) shows  moreover  that the European Union is becoming more involved in the quest for a lasting peace in the Middle East. That is a welcome development.  We all agree that lasting peace is predicated on a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Therefore we must work on all measures which could rapidly open a path towards the resumption of the dialogue  an end to the hostilities  security guarantees for both parties  the liberation of the abducted Israeli soldier    47 06-52885  the release of the political leaders arrested during the crisis  humanitarian access  the re-establishment of basic services  a start to reconstruction and the transfer of the tax and customs income due to the Palestinian authorities.  We support the efforts of the President of the Palestinian Authority to form a government of national unity. Nevertheless  we will be attentive to the content of its platform and to its response to the three conditions set by the Quartet.  I share the assessment of the Secretary-General: in the already tense environment of the Middle East  the region can absolutely not afford a new major crisis. Given the widespread and justified suspicion aroused by the Iranian nuclear programme  I appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Tehran authorities to respond positively to the offers for negotiation made to them. Iran is a great country  with an ancient and esteemed civilization. That heritage  as well as its role in the region  must encourage Iran to promote peace and security and to rebuild confidence with its regional partners  rather than isolating itself through useless provocations. Iran must again take its place in the community of nations and follow the rules that govern international relations. Iran must comply with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006).  A first round of presidential elections and legislative elections were recently held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  thanks to the combined efforts of the Congolese authorities  civil society and the international community. It was quite a challenge. The Congolese people voted in an orderly fashion and in great numbers  and thereby demonstrated a sense of public responsibility and a desire to exercise their democratic rights.   I pay tribute to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) for the positive role it played  assisted by the European Union-led peacekeeping force (EUFOR)  in controlling the skirmishes that occurred at the end of the first round. The electoral process now has to be completed; there is no other option. Calm must return  and the protagonists must commit themselves  in good faith  to applying the rules of democracy. The international community must continue to support the process.  However  the elections are but a first step. Next  the Democratic Republic of the Congo has to establish solid and reliable institutions that are ready to shoulder their responsibilities to the benefit of the people. The potential resources of the Congo are enormous  and so are the challenges ahead in the reconstruction of the country. It is crucial that the new authorities unambiguously demonstrate  their commitment to good governance  both political and economic.  The international community has been a loyal partner for the Congo during this transition. Its support and collaboration  particularly through MONUC  will remain paramount throughout the establishment of the new institutions. I hope that the international community will be able to continue a constructive dialogue with the new Congolese authorities to the benefit of peace  stability and development of the Congo and of the region.  Following the democratic elections that ended the transition period in Burundi took place  the people of Burundi and the international community had high hopes for the prospect of stability and development in that country. That is why we welcomed the recent ceasefire reached with the Forces Nationales de Libération (FNL) movement. I fear  however  that those hopes might be dashed. The Government’s reactions towards the press and the opposition  as well as its management of public affairs  have cast a shadow over the evolution of the democratic process.   The Secretary-General himself expressed his concerns very clearly about the situation in Burundi. The development partners and the regional partners share those concerns. All possible means must be used to consolidate the democratic process in Burundi as well as its development potential. Democracy must be fully exercised  and responsible media  and a responsible civil society  are key elements in that respect. The rule of law must be strengthened  in the interest and with the participation of all. From that perspective  a dialogue with national political partners is indispensable. The new Government has a vital role in this respect. The new Peacebuilding Commission will provide us with opportunities to hold a frank and open dialogue on all these issues.  As all are aware  these days our Organization is devoting greater attention to States emerging from conflict that are in a period of transition. The danger of new tensions in such still-fragile States is very real. Free and democratic elections are important  but they are only one part of the process of rebuilding the rule    06-52885 48  of law. We cannot lose sight of the way in which power is really exercised. We must rebuild States so that they are able to assume their responsibilities towards their neighbours and their own peoples. They must be able to defend their sovereignty and their borders without threatening the stability of their partners; they must have professional and loyal armies at their disposal; and in such States  power must be exercised not to the benefit of the few but to respond to the aspirations of the people. Good governance should be at the centre of the process.  Since the beginning of this year Belgium has held the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)  a regional organization under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations. Its principles and values are the same as those of the United Nations. Its fields of action are very similar and complementary; they include promotion of human rights  democratization  protection of minorities  conflict prevention  crisis management and protection of the environment  not to mention dialogue among civilizations  the combat against the proliferation of small arms  and electoral monitoring.  The OSCE played a key role in maintaining the relationship between the two parts of Europe divided by the cold war. Since that time  the organization has elaborated a number of norms  principles and commitments that unite all its members  which contributes to reinforcing their collective security.   One of the objectives of our chairmanship was to strengthen the balance between the three dimensions of the OSCE: political and military  economic  and humanitarian. We have tried  where possible  to establish in those areas synergies with the United Nations  on issues such as the problems of landlocked countries  combating organized crime and combating terrorism. During its chairmanship  Belgium has worked actively to contribute to a solution to so-called frozen conflicts. But such solutions will be possible only if can count on the genuine will of all parties concerned to move forward.  Some of the criticisms levelled at the United Nations are justified  and we must therefore pursue the reform process  which must above all strengthen the legitimacy  effectiveness and credibility of the United Nations. Those criticisms should not minimize the successes the United Nations has to its credit. Here I am referring to the dramatic increase in the number of peacekeeping operations.   On the other hand  poverty is decreasing worldwide  thanks in particular to the dramatic progress made in Asia. While the trend of increasing poverty has not yet been reversed in sub-Saharan Africa  the 2006 report on the Millennium Development Goals stresses that many African countries are now showing long-term growth potential that could improve the standard of living of their peoples.  I should like to take this opportunity to pay a very sincere tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. He has worked tirelessly  placing his political and negotiating skills in the service of peace  development and human rights. I wish to express my deep gratitude for the dedication he has shown at the helm of our Organization. "
"14",552,"BEN",61,2006,"I am taking part personally in this session of the General Assembly in order to reiterate Benin’s commitment to the noble purposes and principles of the United Nations  and to express the readiness of the Beninese delegation to cooperate and contribute  as best it can  to the success of these deliberations.   But first  allow me  to once again warmly congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her unanimous election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  and to express our appreciation for the remarkable way in which she guided the work of the High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.   I also wish to pay tribute to the remarkable efforts of her predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Sweden  who had the weighty task of leading the sixtieth session of the General Assembly  which was focused  essentially  on the implementation of the major decisions taken at the 2005 World Summit.   Allow me to pay a resounding tribute to my friend Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who over the past 10 years has wisely and skilfully led our Organization at a time of new challenges and threats created by changes unprecedented in the history of humanity.   My country  Benin  believes that the future Secretary-General should come from the continent of Asia. We hope that the new Secretary-General will be able to take the measures necessary to lead the Organization towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).   I am pleased to note that the Assembly is already progressing in the preparation of this great endeavour: the promotion of development is the key issue for the general debate at the sixty-first session  focusing in accordance with Ms. Al-Khalifa’s proposal  on the establishment of a global partnership for development. My country  the Republic of Benin  joins in this debate with the conviction that we will make significant progress in finding pragmatic ways of fulfilling the commitments that have been adopted on many occasions  for the promotion of economic and social development throughout the world.   The question of development is at the heart of the mission of the United Nations. In the Charter  Members proclaimed their belief in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small. They made the commitment to use international institutions in order to encourage economic and social progress for all people.   Hence  reform of the United Nations  if it is to be viable and effective  must also help ensure that our Organization can do better as a framework and an instrument for development through the promotion of the well-being of the poorest of our planet  ensuring the economic growth of the most vulnerable members of the community of nations  in particular the least developed countries.   Financing for development is a factor on which genuine partnership needs to be built between donor countries and developing countries. In this context  the Monterrey Consensus  as members know  continues to be relevant. It is good to note that some donor countries have achieved the objective of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance (ODA) for developing countries  with 0.2 per cent earmarked for least developed countries. It is also important to encourage those who have already established a specific timetable for achieving those objectives. Given the inadequacy of official development assistance  it is important to examine new sources of financing for development activities  and some are already doing so. I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the proposals that have been made by some countries  such as the French Republic and President Jacques Chirac.  Identifying new sources of financing thus deserves special attention. We are pleased that mobilizing the remittances of migrant workers can in some respects also contribute to development action. Nonetheless  it is important to facilitate those transfers so that they can effectively contribute to improving the living conditions of the beneficiary populations and their impact on poverty reduction can be maximized. But it should be stressed that the resources that come from remittances by migrant workers cannot be    06-52885 14  considered part of ODA and should not be included in ODA calculations.  We must also mobilize resources through microcredits for the poorest sectors. The support of the international community should contribute to strengthening microcredit systems  which could be extremely useful in the context of efforts to counteract unemployment among young people and to promote the empowerment of women in order to improve their living conditions and enhance their contribution to the national income of the countries concerned.  We must ensure the full insertion of developing countries  particularly the least advanced  into international trade so that they can be sure that  through that mechanism appropriate resources for financing their development are mobilized. Here we express our disappointment at the failure of the multilateral trade negotiations in the framework of the Doha Round. Among other reasons  they floundered because of the crucial question of agricultural subsidies  which are stifling the producers in developing countries. My country  Benin  will continue to work with other affected countries to ensure the abolition of those subsidies. or at least to get compensations equal to the harm we suffer.  In order to promote development  our countries are seeking to implement democratic reforms. However  as I said at the opening session of the meeting of the least developed countries  any democracy that does not go hand in hand with development is doomed to fail. Also  our efforts to promote development will not bear fruit if we do not succeed in maintaining peace in our own countries and throughout the world.  That is why in 2005 Benin  while it was on the Security Council  sought to contribute to the efforts to enhance the effectiveness of that body in preventing armed conflicts. We welcome the Secretary-General’s prompt action through the inspired and wise recommendations he recently submitted on questions related to the prevention of conflicts. Resolving various conflicts enables the affected developing countries to resolutely get themselves back on the track of reconstruction and national development.  From this rostrum  my country pays tribute to the decisive action being taken by the United Nations in the area of peacekeeping  and we repeat that we are willing to contribute actively to it. The Government of Benin is ready to continue participating in peacekeeping operations in order to allow peoples affected by armed conflicts to overcome them and to create the conditions for stability that are necessary to ensure the reconstruction of their countries and their economic and social development.  For us in Benin  another word for peace is development. This is the message that I wished to bring  on behalf of the people of Benin and of the least developed countries  during this general debate. "
"15",598,"BFA",61,2006,"Madam President  Burkina Faso is pleased to see you presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Please be assured of the full cooperation of my delegation  which will spare no effort to help your noble mission succeed. I would also like to express our gratitude to Mr. Jan Eliasson  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden  who successfully guided the work of the Assembly at the sixtieth session.  This session is being held at a time when peace and security are seeing their foundations severely shaken in several regions of the world. Areas of tension persist in Africa  despite recent efforts to dispel them. That is the case  for example  in the Sudan  Somalia and Côte d’Ivoire. Fortunately  fighting has ceased in several countries  thus opening up real opportunities for progress and development.  In Liberia  Sierra Leone  Guinea-Bissau and Burundi  democracy and building the rule of law have now become a reality. That is proof that nothing  absolutely nothing  can replace the political will of people to engage fully in inclusive and constructive dialogue. We very much hope that the democratic process which is under way in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be successfully pursued. Likewise  we welcome the progress made in the inter-Togolese political dialogue. Having had the privilege of following that process as a facilitator  President Blaise Compaore has been able to sense fully the degree of determination of the Togolese political leaders. That is why we reiterate the appeal he made to Togo’s partners to provide the support necessary for the economic revitalization of Togo.  The crisis in Côte d’Ivoire is at a decisive turning point. We are convinced that with the firm and sincere commitment of all parties and the support of the international community a lasting solution can be found very quickly.  In the Middle East  we have watched a disturbing escalation in the violence in recent months. Since the causes of that conflict are sufficiently known to all  there is no reason to go into them here. While welcoming the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and the deployment of an expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  Burkina Faso strongly hopes that negotiations will continue and intensify at all levels in order to achieve a global and lasting peace in that region  a peace that will restore the sovereignty of Lebanon  provide freedom for the Palestinian people and ensure Israel’s security.  The question of free and fair international trade remains on the table. The collapse of the Doha Development Round is proof of this  and it has shown us the need to search for the best way to ensure that the rules of the multilateral trading system set by the World Trade Organization are strictly observed. For Burkina Faso  which has thrown its full weight behind the interests of African cotton producers  this requirement is more imperative than ever. Sustainable development  the reduction of poverty and the elimination of hunger and precariousness in the world still constitute challenges that must be faced.  Over and above what has been done to reduce debt and find innovative financing mechanisms  which we welcome  the international community must work to forge a true North-South partnership that will guarantee fair treatment of the questions of concern to all the regions and countries in the world. The midterm review of the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries  held several days ago  and its conclusions suggest that we are moving in the right direction.  The sheer scale of international migration in recent years  together with the daily tragedies experienced by thousands of young people who risk their lives  presents a new challenge caused by accelerated globalization. To deal with the problem  the countries of origin  transit and destination must find more imaginative solutions that go to its root causes  as neither barriers  nor borders  nor interdiction  nor forced repatriation can be an adequate  much less a sustainable  response. That is why we welcome the results of the Euro-Africa Conference on Migration and Development  held on 10 and 11 July 2006 in Rabat  the initiatives taken by the African Union to prepare a joint African policy on migration and the   29 06-53323  conclusions of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  held recently in New York at the margins of the current session.  The unprecedented rise in the price of a barrel of oil and the resulting energy crisis have hit our countries hard. The economies of African countries that do not export oil  such as Burkina Faso  will take a long time to recover. This crisis means that we must find not only innovative forms of international solidarity but also alternatives to fossil fuels. With this reality in mind  Burkina Faso has already decided to make the development of biogas from the waste of plant crops  such as cotton  one of its priorities.  The question of nuclear energy has been on the agenda of most of our meetings for some time. Burkina Faso reiterates its firm condemnation of the arms race in general and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in particular. It is now imperative that we give full force to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. However  we must do so without prejudice to the rights of all States to develop  produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  In the name of democracy and justice  we have all sought to create a new United Nations  a symbol of modern governance and efficiency in its management of world affairs. That is why we have undertaken to ensure deep-rooted reform of the Organization and its working methods. Africa in particular is dedicated to that cause because we are convinced that it is the only way to put right an unjustice that has festered over decades.  Change was launched with the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency Response Fund  the conversion of the Commission on Human Rights into the Human Rights Council  and the adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We must now all work together to ensure that multilateralism and universalism triumph over unilateralism. To that end  we need a strong and democratic United Nations that is open to all peoples who seek peace and justice.  That spirit of openness and universalization in the Organization must be a component of a genuine and irreversible democratic movement. That is why we must do justice by the 23 million Taiwanese whose only aspiration has always been to play an active role in our common endeavour to build a better world.  In that respect  Burkina Faso is very pleased to welcome Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United Nations.  On behalf of my country  Burkina Faso  I wish now to pay special tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who  with commitment  tact  selflessness and unprecedented efficiency has breathed new dynamism into the Organization over the past 10 years and rejuvenated the founding elements of the new United Nations that we have dreamed of for decades. As he prepares to move on from this important chapter in his life  we wish him every success in his future activities.  The aspirations of our peoples are vast. Just as we must strive to optimize governance globally  we must also work to entrench local governance  democracy and freedom. That is the only way we will be able to satisfy those legitimate aspirations and to bequeath to future generations a world of peace that is reconciled to itself. "
"16",641,"BGD",61,2006,"I extend my delegation’s sincerest congratulations to the President on her very well-deserved election. I would like to congratulate her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  on his stewardship of the historic sixtieth session of the   9 06-53341  Assembly and to pay a special tribute to the Secretary-General for his dedicated service to the Organization over the past decade. It is also my pleasure to welcome Montenegro as the newest Member of our Organization.   The Assembly is meeting against a backdrop of dire human tragedy. The recent wanton Israeli aggression in Lebanon has shocked the world. Most disconcerting has been the fact that the international community failed to respond promptly and effectively  as colossal devastation wrecked Lebanon and the Lebanese people. In the end  the Security Council redeemed itself by ordering a ceasefire in Lebanon. Let us hope that the Security Council will exercise its mandated responsibilities so that such atrocities and violations of human rights do not occur in the future under any pretext.  Alongside Lebanon  the dire situation in Palestine has worsened owing to the continuous use of disproportionate force by the Israeli Government. We call upon the international community to make sincere efforts to put the peace process back on track.  The scourge of terrorism knows no boundaries. It is professed and carried out by a handful  and the vast majority of victims are innocent men  women and children. Efforts to combat terrorism and its protagonists globally and nationally may have seen some positive results. However  action to combat terror by individual countries has created divisions between peoples and affected interfaith harmony. Many individuals are being subjected to racial or religious profiling  which foments suspicion  misunderstanding and even hatred. That is what the terrorists are actually looking for: to divide the nations of the world. We must ensure that they do not have their way.  Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia has unequivocally declared that Bangladesh abjures religious extremism and does not and will not support any kind of militancy. The Prime Minister has reasserted her Government’s vow to eliminate all militants and their networks. She has called for the passage of tough laws to punish the perpetrators  whom she has repeatedly dubbed enemies of Islam  enemies of democracy  development  humanity and the people of the country — our country  beloved Bangladesh.  In this connection  I must mention that a small group of extremists carried out a country-wide bombing attack on 17 August last year in Bangladesh. But the extremists underestimated the will of the Government and the people of Bangladesh. Instead of fear  there was anger. The Government mobilized all available resources to relentlessly hunt down the leaders and the operatives. I am proud to inform the Assembly that we have been able to bring all the leaders of the outlawed militant group to justice.  Bangladesh today is what it has always been: a moderate  tolerant society that practises democracy and where the equal rights of each and every citizen are preserved. Our determined action did not allow the opportunists and the perpetrators of terror to destroy the values of democracy and tolerance that we treasure most.  For smaller States  the United Nations remains the premier world body  addressing the challenges they face. Despite its shortcomings  the United Nations has proved invaluable in times of crisis and in the tasks of preserving global peace and security and promoting sustainable development.  At present  we are seized of the issue of reform of the United Nations. Bangladesh holds that reform is a process and not an end in itself. We do not think that arbitrary deadlines or pressure in order to obtain a particular outcome are helpful. It is our belief that  for meaningful reform  an environment of mutual trust  confidence and respect for divergent positions is indispensable.  We trust that the new Human Rights Council will not be a mere replication of the Commission on Human Rights. It must not indulge in politicization of its work. Bangladesh  as an elected member  is committed to advancing the work of the Council in a fair and balanced manner.  We hope  too  that the newly constituted Peacebuilding Commission will fill the existing institutional gap in the United Nations system to facilitate the transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding. Bangladesh  being one of the largest contributors to United Nations peacekeeping operations  will bring its experience to the work of the Commission in all its aspects.  As the United Nations deals with individual post-conflict situations  it must not lose sight of wider issues  such as disarmament and small-arms proliferation  as well as weapons of mass destruction.    06-53341 10  Bangladesh would like to see sustained efforts by the United Nations in these very critical areas.  The Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit (resolution 60/1)  which had development as its centrepiece  has hardly progressed beyond mere pledges. For the least developed countries (LDCs)  the savings-investment gap and lack of capital remain the primary constraints to development. Official development assistance (ODA) to the LDCs in 2004  according to the most recent data available  amounted to $23.8 billion  or $35.70 per person living in these countries. This is certainly not sufficient to complement income or boost investment. Faster growth in exports  and the consequent rise in income  could help the LDCs accumulate the resources needed for development. For this  we would need unhindered market access for all LDC exports. The Doha development round must resume to ensure special and differential treatment for the LDCs. We would also need increased ODA  full debt cancellation  foreign direct investment and transfer of technology to enhance the global partnership for development.  We can also increase capital flows to LDCs by addressing one of the fundamental inequities in the global financial system. It is utterly inefficient and unfair that the LDCs cannot utilize their own foreign exchange reserves — a staggering $28 billion — to finance their own development efforts and that these reserves yield very low interest  or none at all. On the other hand  when LDCs borrow against their own reserves  they pay a huge premium in interest or service charges. The United Nations system must lead the international effort to reform the global reserve system and to make arrangements that enable the LDCs to borrow at a zero mark-up of the interest rate against their own foreign exchange reserves.  The General Assembly has just concluded the midterm comprehensive review of the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the LDCs. In this context  I would like to point out that  unless duty-free and quota-free market access for all LDC products is ensured  the agreed development goals and targets will remain unattained for a long time to come. We call on the developed countries to fulfil their pledges of support for the framework to facilitate aid for trade  to which they have committed many times over. An effective monitoring capacity under the auspices of the United Nations can significantly facilitate this task.  Let me now turn to two issues that are of particular concern to Bangladesh. I begin with migration. Liberalizing the movement of labour can generate significant benefits and a win-win result for both sending and receiving countries  as well as for the migrants themselves. Numerous studies have found that a modest commitment under the World Trade Organization’s General Agreement on Trade in Services Mode 4 would offer substantial welfare gains for both developing and developed countries. It may even exceed the gain of complete market liberalization in merchandise trade.  The second issue is the threat of natural disasters  which often undermine our development efforts. The Asian tsunami was a wake-up call for all of us. In these times of increasing global interdependence  disaster risk management is a matter of global concern  as the impact of a disaster in one region adversely affects others. Bangladesh has advanced considerably in the field of comprehensive disaster management. We stand ready to share our experience  which has been internationally recognized as the best-practice model. The United Nations must gear its efforts to introduce weather insurance and weather derivatives to manage the risks of natural disasters  especially in developing countries.  Within weeks of her assumption to power five years ago with a massive mandate from our people  the Government of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia launched a reform programme to restore discipline in our country. Thanks to our relentless efforts  we could accelerate the growth momentum remarkably without destabilizing our macroeconomic fundamentals.  After maintaining a growth rate of 6 per cent for the past five years  we expect a growth rate of 6.7 per cent this fiscal year  against the backdrop of a global economic slowdown. Given natural disasters  political unrest and many external shocks — such as the global economic recession  the phasing out of the Multifibre Arrangement and the oil price hike — that affect our economies  that is a remarkable achievement.  Keeping our commitment to the Millennium Declaration  we have already achieved two Millennium Development Goals by ensuring access to safe drinking water and removing gender disparity in primary and secondary education. Enrolment in primary education has been ensured for 97 per cent of our children. Of course  there is no complacency on our part and we   11 06-53341  know that we should try to achieve 100 per cent enrolment in our primary schools.  Apart from those achievements  Bangladesh has achieved remarkable success in the reduction of child and maternal mortality and malnutrition and in improving food security. We have begun channelling resources to targeted programmes in the light of our Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Our development efforts  however sincere  will not reach their goals or even see the light of day unless they are complemented by international support.  Bangladesh has been pursuing meaningful regional cooperation to improve the socio-economic conditions of South and South-East Asia. As the current Chair of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and as members of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation  the Asia Cooperation Dialogue and the Developing Eight Countries  Bangladesh has demonstrated its commitment to working with other countries of the region. We are working in total harmony with the nations of our region. Our recent partnership in the Regional Forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations bears testimony to our commitment.  The present Government will complete its tenure towards the end of next month and will hand over power to a neutral caretaker Government in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We very much hope to return to work again with the General Assembly. We have had peaceful transfers of power over the past three elections under neutral caretaker Governments when the voters exercised their franchise freely and without fear or intimidation. The system has worked and has been accepted by the people. Democracy has taken firm root in our country and the next general election will be one more opportunity for the people to demonstrate that they are the ultimate source of power.  I end with the assurance that we will work together for a better tomorrow for future generations. "
"17",687,"BGR",61,2006,"Allow me first of all to align myself with the very warm congratulations addressed to you  Madam President  on your election to your very important position. I would like to assure you once again of the full support of my country in your endeavours for further reform of our Organization and for the consolidation of its role in the coming year. I would also like to express our gratitude to the previous President of the General Assembly  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his dedicated and efficient work and for the achievements that were made in implementing United Nations reforms.  I would also like to greet the newest member of our large family  the Republic of Montenegro. I am sure that that country from our region  South-East Europe  will spare no effort in contributing to the work of the United Nations. (spoke in French)  Bulgaria is on the threshold of a historic achievement. After 17 years of reforms to build political democracy and a market economy  my country is preparing to join the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007. Our journey  although difficult  has been successful. I am certain that  as a new member of the Union  Bulgaria will contribute added value to the European Common Foreign and Security Policy. We will work with even greater determination for a strong and effective United Nations  which must be at the very centre of the global security and development system. Bulgaria endorses the position set out earlier by the Finnish presidency of the EU.  We welcome the fact that concrete outcomes have been achieved in implementation of the radical reform process launched at last year’s World Summit. We hope that that the momentum will be maintained and that the process  which is necessary and useful for all Member countries  will move forward even more quickly.  I would like to express our profound respect and gratitude to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless efforts throughout the past decade to strengthen the United Nations in a globalized world.  I would like to refer to the resolution that was recently adopted on the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. The implementation of the resolution should lead to enhanced coordination of the work of the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council  and to a strengthened role for the President of the General Assembly  a streamlined agenda and improved methods of work.  No United Nations reform effort would be complete without the crucial element of Security Council reform. Despite all the efforts made  we have not yet been able to reach consensus on a viable formula for Council expansion that can be supported by all Member States. Bulgaria believes that any reform exercise should increase the representativity and legitimacy of the Council  while preserving the effectiveness of its decisions and its key role in maintaining peace and security. We also support efforts to improve its working methods.  At the level of institutional reform  two new United Nations bodies have been established: the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. Their potential will be realized in the future. There are certain areas  however  where the desired progress is far from being achieved: mandate review  the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council    17 06-53323  ensuring effective management and promoting coordination among the agencies and bodies of the United Nations system. Despite the challenges  our work must continue at an accelerated pace with a view to the achievement of concrete results during this session.  I would like to point out that yesterday Bulgaria deposited its instruments of ratification relating to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. We also attach great importance to combating the traffic in human beings and drugs  as well as to the fight against organized crime.  Five years on from 11 September 2001  terrorism in all its manifestations continues to pose a genuine threat to human civilization. That is why Bulgaria welcomes the launching of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy to fight that scourge at all levels. The consensus that has emerged regarding the Strategy must give impetus to the process of adopting a comprehensive international convention on terrorism  in accordance with the decisions taken at the 2005 World Summit. Such a convention would provide the international community with an effective  comprehensive  universal legal framework for the fight against that scourge and give substance to its firm condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  Bulgaria supports all initiatives to promote dialogue and mutual understanding among people of different religions  ethnic groups and cultures. Bulgarian history and our national experience have always been characterized by dialogue and tolerance. In this context  we look forward to the recommendations of the High-Level Panel of the Alliance of Civilizations  and we will take part in their implementation.  Bulgaria pursues a policy aimed at promoting effective arms control  the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and disarmament. We are concerned about the genuine threat of destabilization affecting legal instruments currently in force  in particular the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  because of non-compliance with obligations and unilateral withdrawals by certain States.   We support the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We firmly believe that the unresolved question of the Iranian nuclear programme should be dealt with promptly  on the basis of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006) and relevant decisions of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Likewise  we call for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1695 (2006) and urge progress in the six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear problem.  The United Nations must be endowed with sufficient capacity to enable it to deploy multidimensional peacekeeping operations that are aimed not just at maintaining peace  but also at strengthening the sovereignty of States and building democratic institutions that will guarantee the stability of peace processes. In this context  I would like to point out that yesterday Bulgaria signed the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Security of United Nations and Associated Personnel.  As a member of NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  as a future member of the European Union and as a country that contributes troops to peacekeeping operations  Bulgaria actively promotes effective partnership and cooperation among the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations in activities aimed at conflict prevention  peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Current cooperation between the European Union  the United Nations and the African Union is an encouraging example of such cooperation  which is already bearing fruit.  My country is actively contributing to long-term security and stability in South-East Europe. We welcome the fact that the Balkans are now seen as a region  not of crisis and conflict  but of cooperation and integration. One convincing example of political cooperation among the countries of that region is the South-East Europe Cooperation Process. Bulgaria is preparing to assume the chairmanship of that Process in mid-2007  and we will work tirelessly to ensure that that structure can support regional cooperation and promote European and Euro-Atlantic integration in that part of Europe.  In addressing our geographic region  I cannot overlook the problem of Kosovo. Reaching a decision on the future status of that province is on the agenda of the international community. Bulgaria is playing a very    06-53323 18  active role in efforts aimed at creating the atmosphere of trust and openness necessary for the holding of such negotiations. We fully support the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General  Mr. Martti Ahtisaari  in his efforts to find a solution  based on the maximum amount of common ground  to which both parties could agree. We call on the international community to let itself be guided by the principles of sustainability  monitoring  regional stability and the European perspective in working out a final decision on the status of Kosovo.  Bulgaria attaches particular importance to the situation in the Middle East. We welcome and support the efforts of the Secretary-General and the Security Council  as well as the key role being played by the European Union in the expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  which is called on to ensure peace in southern Lebanon in implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). Bulgaria will make its own contribution to the international community’s efforts to bring about lasting peace.  We remain convinced that the crisis in Israeli-Palestinian relations would be best resolved by direct negotiations between the countries concerned  based on an absolute rejection of the use of force and with the necessary support of the international community. We support all of the efforts to that end on the part of the Quartet  as presented yesterday here at the United Nations.  Bulgaria greatly appreciates United Nations initiatives relating to the stabilization of the political and constitutional process in Iraq  as well as the principles set out in the International Compact. We will continue to meet our obligations in Iraq in support of national institutions aimed at providing for the security and prosperity of that country.  We support all positive trends towards strengthening the sovereignty of Afghanistan. During the past year  my country doubled its participation in the International Security Assistance Force. We support the Afghanistan Compact adopted at the London Conference a few months ago.   We welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 1706 (2006)  whose implementation will assist in the implementation of the political agreements recently reached on the Sudan. In our view  the international community must take urgent action to address the humanitarian tragedy in Darfur.  Bulgaria  with more than 50 years’ experience as an active and responsible Member of our Organization  and which has served three terms in the Security Council and held the presidency of the General Assembly for one year  has submitted its candidacy to the Economic and Social Council for the period 2007-2009. I am convinced that our country’s experience and expertise  as well as its commitment to contribute to strengthening the effectiveness of the United Nations  are important reasons to support our candidacy. (spoke in English)  We are witnessing and also taking an active part in the implementation of the most important reform since the United Nations was founded. Today more than ever before  the peoples of the world need our Organization to help establish long-lasting peace  prosperity and a better future for new generations. We must succeed in reforming the United Nations so that it can change the world for the better. "
"18",732,"BHR",61,2006,"I am pleased to express my sincerest congratulations to you  Madam President  upon your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. It reflects the international community’s trust in your diplomatic abilities  which will help ensure the success of this important session.   I want to take this opportunity to extend my deepest appreciation to all the countries that endorsed the nomination of Shaikha Haya Bint Rashed Al-Khalifa. The election of Shaikha Haya as President of the Assembly is an honour for the Kingdom of Bahrain  she being the third woman in the history of this Organization  as well as the first Arab and Muslim woman  to hold this prominent position. This election confirms the significant achievements and progress of women in the Kingdom of Bahrain.   I take this opportunity to commend her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  for his tireless efforts during the Assembly’s sixtieth session  one that will be remembered for efforts to reform the Organization.  I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his devotion in promoting the United Nations and strengthening its leading role in upholding peace and security throughout the world  particularly in our Arab region during his recent trip to the Middle East.  In addition  I wish to congratulate the Republic of Montenegro upon its admission to the United Nations as the l92nd Member State. Allow me to express the hope that its joining this Organization will enhance peace and stability in the world.  The central force behind progress in developing countries and among their peoples lies in the inching of political reforms  economic liberalization and social modernization. This is the platform that the Kingdom of Bahrain has implemented in its reform process  led for several years by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa  to strengthen democracy  human rights and economic growth. National gains have multiplied and popular participation in the political  economic and social fields has increased. This is reflected in many areas.   Democratic practices have been enhanced through municipal and parliamentary elections  with men and women participating as voters and candidates  and by the establishment of the Institute for Political Development to enhance democratic practices and a culture of dialogue in the Kingdom. The Arab Charter on Human Rights has been ratified and a counter-terrorism law has been passed. We have acceeded to the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Kingdom of Bahrain has been elected to membership of the United Nations Human Rights Council. We are working closely with other members to promote and protect human rights in all areas. We have enhanced the role of women in society to assume leadership positions in the Kingdom  including the judiciary. In addition  a programme to empower women  overseen by the Supreme Council for Women  has been approved.   We are forging a partnership with non-governmental organizations (NGOs)  as was evident in the Forum for the Future hosted by the Kingdom of Bahrain last November. At that Forum  NGOs worked side by side with Governments in discussing human rights  the fight against corruption  the rule of law and the empowerment of women. Indeed  Bahrain takes pride in having the largest number of NGOs in proportion to its population  with approximately 300 registered NGOs.   We are addressing negative phenomena in the national economy  such as unemployment  by initiating a national project to provide jobs for the unemployed. Moreover  the Kingdom of Bahrain has consolidated its pioneering economic role in the Gulf region through laws to attract investment under the supervision of the Economic Development Board.   A high committee to reform education has been formed to develop and modernize the education system. Its recommendations were adopted in June 2006. The Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to rank high in human development  as confirmed in the latest United Nations Human Development Report. Positive integrated development on the political  social  cultural and economic levels was further evidenced by the recommendations of the National Conference for Social Policies in the Kingdom of Bahrain  held in the    06-53323 14  spring of this year under the auspices of the United Nations  which aimed to promote integration and cohesion of all aspects and components of development.  We in the Kingdom of Bahrain still view the phenomenon of terrorism and terrorist acts in many parts of the world as the most dangerous threat to international peace and security. There must be greater effort by the international community and more coordination on all levels to confront and contain this scourge. The Kingdom commends United Nations efforts to fight terrorism. The Secretary-General’s report issued last April entitled “Uniting against terrorism: recommendations for a global counter-terrorism strategy” (A/60/825) contains many constructive elements that we embrace  along with other points that need further examination and discussion. It is important that any counter-terrorism strategy not infringe on human rights or fundamental freedoms  while complying with international law. One of the positive aspects of that report is its call to address issues that are exploited by terrorists and to study the motives behind terrorism.  The Kingdom of Bahrain has continued its tireless efforts in this field. In fact  it has already signed 11 of the 12 international agreements on terrorism and hosts the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force established in November 2004 to combat money-laundering and terrorist financing. In addition  Bahrain continuously coordinates efforts with its brotherly neighbours of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)  pursuant to the GCC Counter-Terrorism Agreement adopted in May 2004. Implementation of the strategy proposed in the Secretary-General’s report is just a beginning  as the report states. What is more important is its full implementation.  The events in the Middle East in recent months  especially in Gaza  the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and then during the past few weeks in Lebanon  have driven the entire region to the edge of an abyss that could become even more dangerous. We must all work more diligently to address the root causes and repercussions of this struggle  which frustrates hopes for peace and disappoints the aspirations of the peoples of the region for peace  stability and security.  Resolution of this catastrophic situation  with its dire consequences  must not be delayed. The international community has special and multiple responsibilities in this regard. Therefore the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers called upon the Security Council to meet at the ministerial level. That meeting was held yesterday to discuss all tracks in accordance with the terms of reference of the peace process  relevant Security Council resolutions  the principle of land for peace and the Arab Peace Initiative  which was presented by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and adopted by the Arab summits. A settlement should be pursued through a new and developed mechanism to resume direct negotiations among the parties under the Council’s supervision  within a specified time limit and with international guarantees.  We wish to express our deep concern at the bloody events and huge destruction that took place in brotherly Lebanon this year caused by Israeli military operations. On the basis of our concern for the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon  we support resolution 1701 (2006) and the need for all parties to comply with it. We also affirm the importance of the international community’s support for the seven points set out by His Excellency Mr. Fouad Siniora  Prime Minister of Lebanon  to complement that resolution. We reaffirm that the Kingdom of Bahrain stands with the Republic of Lebanon against anything that endangers its sovereignty and territorial integrity and support it with a view to preventing any act outside Lebanese State authority that endangers its stability. We also express our appreciation for the efforts of the Arab Tripartite Committee on Lebanon  the State of Qatar — the Arab member of the Security Council — and all other States that have supported the Arab position.  The Kingdom of Bahrain realizes that Lebanon  today  faces great challenges that require concerted international efforts by the United Nations  the European Union and all influential Powers. Such efforts must be aimed not solely at keeping the peace but also at rebuilding and reviving the economy with the help of the Lebanese Government and people  so that Lebanon can participate once again  as it has done through the centuries  in the cultural and economic development of the Middle East and the world at large. In this regard  the recent Stockholm Conference was a step in the right direction.   15 06-53323   We reiterate our position that a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East necessitates  first and foremost  that Israel withdraw fully from all Arab territories occupied since 1967  including the Syrian Golan Heights and the remaining occupied Lebanese territories. It also requires the return of Palestinian refugees and the establishment of a Palestinian State on all occupied Palestinian lands  with Jerusalem as its capital.  The Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the recent positive developments in Iraq  including the election of a national assembly and the formation of a permanent Iraqi Government. The Kingdom of Bahrain also welcomes the Iraqi Government’s steps to promote genuine national reconciliation and accord and to consolidate peace  stability  and dialogue among all segments of society. Bahrain hopes that the Government’s national reconciliation measures will put an end to violence and the killing of innocent civilians  restore stability and preserve Iraq’s unity and cohesion. We also hope that these measures will lead to renunciation of violence and to addressing the waves of killing  sectarianism and extremism  so that a new safe and unified Iraq can emerge and enjoy democracy and the rule of law  an Iraq with close relations with its Arab and Islamic brothers and one that adheres to its international commitments and responsibilities. There is no doubt that the Iraqi Government’s efforts in this direction are supported by the pivotal role that Iraq’s neighbouring countries have played in reinforcing their good-neighbourly policies  through respect for Iraq’s sovereignty  cooperation in controlling the borders and non-interference in Iraq’s internal affairs.  The Kingdom of Bahrain  together with the other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council  calls for a peaceful settlement of the dispute between the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the three islands of Greater Tunb  Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa  which belong to brotherly United Arab Emirates. This dispute should be settled either through negotiations or by referring it to the International Court of Justice for adjudication.  Within the framework of maintaining regional security in the Gulf region  we confirm that friendly relations among Gulf countries should be based on respect for the principles of sovereignty  independence  territorial integrity  good-neighbourliness  non-interference in internal affairs and peaceful settlement of disputes. This would create a positive atmosphere that would help address issues in a spirit of conciliation and in accordance with international law  particularly on the issue of the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  in order not to threaten the security  economic and environmental concerns of the countries of the region and help them avoid the dangers of confrontation and tension. To support the creation of such a positive environment  we should work together to make the Middle East  including the Gulf region  a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. At the same time  we affirm the right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and under the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards regime.  Today  all of us need to join in efforts to achieve the objective of a collective security system through multilateral diplomacy  for which the United Nations is the main arena. Through your presidency  Madam  we hope that our efforts will yield new measures to reform the Organization. In his report on the work of the Organization (A/61/1)  the Secretary-General states that no reform of the United Nations will be complete without the reform of the Security Council  which should be more representative of today’s geopolitical realities. This would make it more efficient and transparent. Furthermore  we hail the establishment this year of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council.  The gap between developed and developing countries remains wide in the areas of economic  human  scientific and technological development. Developing countries must redouble their efforts to bridge this gap and mitigate its negative impact. They need to promote good governance  uphold human rights  expand democratic participation  enhance transparency  empower women and enhance their role on the international stage. However  they cannot achieve this by themselves: developed countries must continue their commitment to offer support and assistance by cancelling debts and supplying developing countries with the knowledge  up-to-date technology and expertise they need to achieve sustainable development.  The Millennium Development Goals are the best road map towards sustainable development. Those Goals can be reached only through an international strategic partnership between developed and developing countries  along with international    06-53323 16  organizations and agencies  in particular the United Nations  and with the participation of civil society institutions and the private sector  in view of the vital national and international role they play.  It is true to say that changes in the world situation and great progress achieved by the international community have brought human civilization to wider horizons in which there is no excuse for excluding or marginalizing others. We believe that there is plenty of room for dialogue and positive diversity. This is because we  as nations  are linked in a single international civilization  one that is rich in religions and cultures and within which we can explore everything that can bring peace and stability to the whole world.  In conclusion  Madam  we hope that  under your presidency  this session will be marked by the spirit of reform that has pervaded the United Nations. We confirm the need to unify our efforts and exercise patience and flexibility in order to achieve reform and development. The Kingdom of Bahrain is committed to achieving those goals and will support efforts to strengthen the United Nations and its position in the world. "
"19",770,"BHS",61,2006,"I congratulate Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I also commend her predecessor  Jan Eliasson of Sweden  for his outstanding performance as President of the General Assembly at the preceding session.  I acknowledge and pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his many years of dedication to the United Nations. The Government and people of the Bahamas are profoundly grateful to Secretary-General Annan for all that he has done for the United Nations  and I look forward to welcoming him one day to the Bahamas so that we might thank him personally.  I also congratulate and welcome Montenegro as the 192nd State Member of the United Nations and convey the best wishes of the Government of the Bahamas for the prosperity and welfare of all its people.  The Bahamas stands for democracy  the rule of law and the right to self-determination. In this very body  before the Committee of 24 on decolonization  our national leaders made the case for the independence of our country. We were able to achieve that in 1973  and ever since then successive administrations have voiced the Bahamas’ support of the same principles. I do so again today. In doing so  I remind this body that the Bahamas and the region of which it is a part are shining examples to all the world of all of those principles. Within the next year  the Bahamian people will again have the opportunity to choose their Government in a general election based on universal adult suffrage. There have been  within the past year in our region  similar general elections in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Guyana. The Bahamas does not support the use of the military in Government or to overthrow legitimately elected Governments. Wherever that occurs  it must be deplored and there must be a return to constitutional democratic rule within the shortest possible time.  In our foreign policy  the Bahamas believes in peace with all nations and we seek to avoid ideological battles. Ours is a policy that avoids extremism  while at the same time letting our voice be heard for the dispossessed. We have the right to be here to speak for ourselves and to speak for those who cannot speak. Our people have fought for their voice to be heard and they will be heard.  My delegation welcomes the attempt by the Security Council to increase the transparency of the selection process in that body for the post of Secretary-General by apprising the President of the General Assembly of its proposed actions on this matter and on the results of the straw polls. We would take this opportunity to assure this body that whoever succeeds to the post will have our support and cooperation.  It was just over a year ago that we adopted the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document that has served as the road map for reform efforts over the past 12 months. The Bahamas  like other States Members of this Organization  is pleased that a number of reforms have been implemented. In that regard  we note the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. With regard to the Human Rights Council  we hope that it will evolve as an entity dedicated to a process of constructive dialogue and cooperation in which all countries may participate on an equal footing.  The Bahamas renews its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals  and in particular to universal education  fighting HIV/AIDS  equality for women and cutting poverty in half by 2015. The country’s international  award-winning Urban Renewal Initiative has begun to address in particular the issue of poverty in the Bahamas. The further reform of the Economic and Social Council should lead to its being   17 06-53615  empowered to implement the internationally agreed development goals and commitments to the eradication of poverty  hunger and all other ills that continue to plague humanity.  I turn now to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the issue of regional global security. We renew our commitments in that area. However  as we have done for the past four years  we want to take the opportunity to further define our security interests as not being limited to the strategies defined by a narrow view of counter-terrorism. We believe that counter-terrorism strategies should be informed by a much broader definition  namely  as ensuring the stability of our societies as we fight our vulnerabilities to drug traffickers  natural and environmental disasters and poverty  and our challenges with education and health care. In particular  we call upon the developed economies in our region and further afield to remember their moral and legal obligations to stop the assault of small arms on our societies  to cooperate in stopping the flow of drugs through our region  and to work together with us in declaring the Caribbean Sea and its environs to be a nuclear-free zone. There must be a strategic alliance between developed economies and those in our region to ensure that those security vulnerabilities are minimized  if not eliminated.  The Bahamas is greatly heartened by the fact that Member States have agreed on the text of the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities  which is to be adopted by the General Assembly in the months ahead. That landmark convention recognizes the importance for persons with disabilities of their individual autonomy and independence  including the freedom to make their own choices  and it acknowledges that those persons should have the opportunity to be actively involved in decision-making processes about policies and programmes  particularly those of direct concern to them. That is an important step in empowering not only persons with disabilities  but also the neighbourhoods  communities  societies and countries in which they live. For too long  persons with disabilities have been marginalized in many settings  depriving them of their rights as citizens and depriving society of the many contributions they could make in the exercise of their full and unimpeded participation. The Bahamas plans legislation to further empower the disabled during the current session of our Parliament.  It has often been said that reform is a process and not an event. We continue to support reform of the Security Council so that it may more accurately reflect the interests and balance of power in the realities of the twenty-first century  including allowing small island developing States to play a greater role in its activities. It is our hope that  during this sixty-first session of the General Assembly  we will see some significant movement in the reform of the Security Council.  Any reform would mean very little  however  if it did not ultimately translate into the well-being of the people of this planet. In that vein  the Bahamas will do its part towards the implementation of the global partnership for development and the translation of that partnership into not only effective international  multilateral economic  trading  financial and environmental governance systems and mechanisms  but also into the proliferation of healthy  productive households and communities that contribute to increased global welfare and security.   We want to take this opportunity to recall our concern about coercive measures by developed States that adversely affect the trade in services in the Bahamian economy and in our region generally. We reiterate our call for levelling the playing field and for a global forum to address how the issue of a level playing field can be translated into international public policy.  The Bahamas welcomed and participated in the recent High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. At that time  the Bahamas outlined the many positive impacts that international migration had made on its economy and cultural development. However  the Bahamas also noted the many challenges the country had experienced over the previous 60 years in managing migration  including those related to the prevention of irregular or unauthorized migration.   For the Bahamas  irregular or unauthorized migration has given rise to considerable challenges in the social and educational sectors  as well as to serious national security issues. In this regard  the Bahamas has pledged to work with our partners in the region towards the establishment of a better way to match the supply with the demand for migration in safe  legal  humane and orderly ways  in order to maximize the societal and human development potential of global labour mobility  with the involvement of private-sector and public-sector stakeholders.    06-53615 18   The Bahamas is committed to sustainable development. To a small-island developing State  there are few things more important than securing the necessary assistance in order to build resilience against the many hazards that afflict the country on a consistent basis  including violent storms or hurricanes  which pass through our region even more frequently as a result of global warming. In this connection  we look to our partners in the region  the hemisphere and around the world to reduce greenhouse gases. We call on those countries that have not yet done so to sign the Kyoto Protocol. It is also imperative that we all commit ourselves to the development of alternative sources of energy  in order to become less dependent on the current polluting technologies that supply our energy needs but threaten our sustainability.  The Bahamas would like to take this opportunity to once again congratulate the people of one of our regional partners  Haiti  on the election and installation of its democratically elected Government. It is imperative that the international community do all it possibly can to help Haiti establish stability and security and promote sustained and sustainable development within its national borders.  As I have stated on previous occasions  the Bahamas  which sits some 90 miles over the seas to the north of Haiti  has a special interest in its stability and prosperity. Instability in Haiti is bound to cause instability in the Bahamas. A significant proportion of the population in the Bahamas is either Haitian or of Haitian descent. A migration crisis resulting from instability in Haiti will have an immediate effect on the Bahamas. Such a crisis would be difficult for our country to endure and  with the will of the Haitian community and the support of the world community  we believe that it can and should be avoided.  The Bahamas has always made known its support for the people of Haiti and their aspirations for peace  security and development. We have and continue to take seriously our commitment to assist the people of Haiti in taking charge of their destiny and placing their country on the path to enduring democracy and development. The Bahamas believes that it is therefore imperative that the promised international financial assistance to Haiti is delivered in a timely and efficient manner.  I would also like to take this opportunity to signal my Government’s support for the upcoming Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Caribbean Common Market initiative to encourage the United Nations to mark and commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in 2007. Slavery and the concomitant slave trade together stand as one of the most vicious violations of human rights in recorded history. As the global sentinel for human rights  the United Nations has a duty to highlight the 200th anniversary of the cessation of this crime against humanity with a special event in 2007. We hope that this initiative will receive the wide and enthusiastic support of this General Assembly and indeed of the wider United Nations community.  This commemoration will present an ideal opportunity to pay tribute to peoples of African descent across the entire spectrum of the diaspora who share a common heritage and  having survived the middle passage  have gone on to form the bedrock on which the prosperity of many developed countries has been built. For its part  the Bahamas plans to undertake a number of commemorative events including a festival of arts which will run from March 2007 to January 2008. During the festival  a different country or region of Africa will be showcased each month as a means of exposing Bahamians to the rich culture of Africa through theatre  art  music and dance.  One of the other challenges that we will face during this session is reaching agreement on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of expenses of the United Nations for the next triennium. We look forward to engaging with other Member States to achieve a scale of assessments that is broadly based on the principle of the capacity to pay  and that it is transparent  equitable and stable.  The Bahamas continues to believe that the Charter of the United Nations constitutes a viable and firm foundation on which the Organization can balance and achieve its objectives to maintain international peace and security and to promote economic and social progress. I want to take this opportunity to reaffirm the commitment of the Bahamas to the principles enshrined in that universal document  as well as to the ongoing process of reform  which seeks to more effectively translate these principles into real peace  security and sustainable development for all the world’s inhabitants. While dramatic progress may sometimes evade us  we must not be swayed from our course  and we must remain confident that our   19 06-53615  activities and efforts will benefit future generations. Now more than ever we need the United Nations. "
"20",795,"BIH",61,2006,"It is a great honour and a pleasure to address the General Assembly at its sixty-first session on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  First of all  I would like to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election to her important post  and also to thank the former President for his contribution to the United Nations reform process.  Bosnia and Herzegovina aligns itself with the statement made by the representative of the European Union (EU)  which provides a framework for the discussion of issues such as peace  stability  development  human rights  the rule of law and the need to further strengthen and reform the United Nations.  We endorse the EU statement  but we would also like to share with the Assembly Bosnia and Herzegovina’s experience in peacebuilding  the implementation of human rights and the rule of law and economic development in a post-conflict environment. We believe that in that way we can contribute to the future success of the international community elsewhere in the world.  Bosnia and Herzegovina is  beyond any doubt  an example of successful intervention by the international community  despite a few negative experiences. I would like to make it absolutely clear that the job in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not yet done. There are still    06-52885 34  some bridges that we have to cross before we will have finished the 15-year-long marathon task of stopping the fighting  promoting reconciliation and building a stable Bosnia and Herzegovina with a view to becoming an EU member in the near future.  Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to Europe; it is part of the European continent. Medical students — future doctors — all take the Hippocratic oath. They swear to apply the highest ethical norms. Law students get their basic training from the standards of Roman law. The European heritage and European practices are firmly rooted in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must now embrace all European Union standards and norms. We do not feel discouraged when we hear people talk of “enlargement fatigue”. Through the enlargement process  Europe is spreading democracy itself. It would be completely contrary to EU and United Nations principles to grow tired of the spread of democracy.  Recent events in the Middle East have shown us how important it is to achieve a just and lasting peace there. But just as we sympathize with people living in crisis areas today  so too those living in such areas can observe the process of peacebuilding in Bosnia. One should pay attention not just to the stabilization of one State in the Balkans but also to the capacity that the EU and the rest of the international community have to initiate swift and efficient intervention.  We in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been assisted by the United Nations  NATO  the EU  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Council of Europe. We have also benefited from other  unique assistance mechanisms  such as the recently established Office of the High Representative and the Peace Implementation Council  which include European Union members  Japan  Russia  the United States of America  Canada  Turkey and others.   The war has been stopped  the refugees have returned and today we are negotiating a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. However  none of us should allow the current flaws in Bosnia and Herzegovina to develop into something more serious  leading to instability.  As magnificent as it was in terms of stopping the war  the Dayton Peace Agreement did not tackle some essential issues  such as providing for every citizen to enjoy equal rights throughout the country  or for the State to be able to exercise its powers as a modern  multi-ethnic State.  Many visitors to my country are especially impressed by the number of churches  mosques and synagogues that there are  and the way in which they coexist in close proximity to one another  serving their purpose in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is the spirit of Bosnia that we inherited from our ancestors  but the Dayton Agreements have not enabled us to maintain that traditional aspect of the country.  On the other hand  Bosnia and Herzegovina has been able to achieve economic and political development  which strengthens its prospects for joining Euro-Atlantic integration processes. The number of foreign military troops on our soil has been reduced tenfold and the mandate of the EU-led peacekeeping force has shifted from stabilization to integration. We have established a single economic space and a single judiciary system  and the various intelligence services are now united and are for the first time under strict and democratic parliamentary supervision. We have formed a single State-level Ministry of Defence  and thereby qualified for accession to the NATO Partnership for Peace programme.  Bosnia and Herzegovina  as it is today  was not shaped by conventional political means. Its structure was defined by the Dayton Peace Agreement as a way to prevent war. The sustainability of the Bosnia and Herzegovina of Dayton has been strengthened by the launching of the Stabilization and Association Agreement negotiations with the European Union  which began on the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Agreement.  The Office of the High Representative is scheduled to be abolished in the middle of next year. That Office will be transformed into the Office of the Special Representative of the EU for Bosnia and Herzegovina. That should be linked to our signing of the SAA with the European Union. So far  negotiations have gone well  and Bosnia has demonstrated sufficient awareness and technical ability to enable it to embark on the Euro-integration project. We are preparing for elections in October  but  unfortunately  the ongoing campaigns have delayed our efforts to fulfil the vital political criteria.  Next week  by voting  the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina will have an opportunity to participate in   35 06-52885  the shaping of their future. They deserve election campaigns that look not at the past  but towards the future. They do not deserve campaigns such as the one that was characterized last week by the EU Council of Ministers as a cause for concern and prompted it to stress the EU’s commitment to the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Bosnia and Herzegovina participates actively in regional cooperation  and we participate in all regional initiatives  including the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe  the South-East European Cooperation Process  the Adriatic and Ionian Initiative and many other programmes and projects. On that basis  a huge number of bilateral and multilateral agreements were signed  creating an international legal framework for cooperation on and the harmonization of a number of issues.  That is especially interesting in the light of the Kosovo issue. Bosnia and Herzegovina keeps a close eye on the negotiations. We believe that any solution must be the result of negotiations if both sides are to accept it. Any future solution should accommodate a common future within the Euro-Atlantic environment. The consequences of the final solution  once it is found  must under no circumstances jeopardize the stability of the region or that of the neighbouring States.  I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the path to successfully achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Those priorities are complementary with the criteria for European Union membership. In cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency  Bosnia and Herzegovina is developing capacities for the detection and prevention of illegal trading in and the proliferation of radioactive materials throughout our territory.  As a mine-affected country  Bosnia and Herzegovina is quite active in the implementation of the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. It is well known that there is still a significant number of landmines in our country as a consequence of war. I should like to thank all the countries that have contributed to the demining process in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  We are also playing an active role in United Nations programmes that address the issue of HIV/AIDS. We have established a State-level commission to fight AIDS. Its current activities focus on preventing the disease from spreading  establishing an early warning system  and informing the public of the dangers of the disease.  As a young democracy and a country with special experience  Bosnia and Herzegovina supported the forming of the Human Rights Council and the strengthening of the role of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We believe that their work is gaining in importance every day. We strongly and decisively support the international system for universal human rights protection.  In my country  human rights have been violated not only by war and crises  but also by certain decisions of the international community. One example is the problem of decertified police officers. The decisions of the United Nations-led international police caused them to lose their work permits. They were offered no opportunity to file complaints or take their cases to any type of court review. Our Ministry for Human Rights has prepared  in close cooperation with the Office of the High Representative for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina  a possible model for a review process  to be led by the European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina  the current representative of the international police presence in the country. The absurd and flagrant violation of human rights committed by the United Nations itself is a mistake that must be acknowledged. It can thereby be corrected and the credibility of the United Nations as an institution preserved.  One of the most important international obligations of Bosnia and Herzegovina is cooperation with The Hague Tribunal for war crimes. That is indeed a precondition for long-term stability. That is why it was offered to the entire region as a condition of further progress in Euro-Atlantic terms. According to the data gathered by both domestic and foreign intelligence  most wanted war criminals are not hiding on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our institutions are focused on cutting off the financial support networks. It is a sad and pitiful fact that Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have not yet been arrested  but it is even worse for Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens to be punished because of the two of them. We are penalizing the victims instead of punishing the criminals. Bosnia and Herzegovina    06-52885 36  must be allowed to pursue progress on its road to democratization and the European Union  because improvement in that regard will create an even stronger mechanism for destroying the war criminals’ support network.  The horrible terrorist attacks on New York  the anniversary of which we recently marked  changed the world’s entire security paradigm. The attacks made us think in ever more serious terms. Terrorism is one of the greatest challenges faced by the modern world  and it is virtually impossible for countries to respond to such a challenge individually. Member States may individually strengthen their capacities  but a global and complete response can be achieved only by the United Nations.  Having established the Ministry of Security  an intelligence agency and an investigations and protection agency at the State level  and by coordinating their work through the Counter-Terrorism Task Force  we have undertaken a series of very important steps not just in terms of internal reforms  but also in terms of our contribution to the global anti-terrorist campaign. We have adopted an anti-terrorism strategy for the period 2006-2009 that will guide us through the implementation of European standards in that field. We are in the final stages of adopting a new law on the fight against terrorism and financial support for terrorism.  Bosnia and Herzegovina wholeheartedly supported the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  and we genuinely hoped to contribute actively to its work. The experience of peacebuilding in Bosnia is vast and relevant  and we are eager to share it with other Member States.  Although our country was not elected  we wish to thank all those who supported us through the process. At the very least  we sent yet another signal to the world that we are no longer simply the receivers of international aid. The support we gained has encouraged us to continue to insist on a more balanced and more proactive participation in United Nations projects worldwide. In that context  I stress Bosnia and Herzegovina’s aspirations as a candidate for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the term 2010-2011  and I would welcome the Assembly’s support in that regard.  Despite our limited capacities  we try to participate in international peace efforts. We have sent our military observers and police officers to the Congo  Ethiopia  Liberia  Haiti  the Sudan  Eritrea and Cyprus. As a sign of our support for the Iraqi people  we have deployed a demining squadron to assist  to the extent of its capacities  in building a sustainable and stable Iraq.   The escalation of conflict in the Middle East marked this summer and claimed many victims  numerous civilians among them. We support Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) calling for a full cessation of hostilities. We particularly appreciate the diplomatic efforts of Security Council members  including the United States and France  that led to the final harmonization of the resolution. We hope that this positive breakthrough will constitute a sound basis for diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and that lasting peace will finally be achieved in that region.  I would also like to call attention to the humanitarian issues that are generally discussed at every session of the General Assembly. In order to contribute to the work of the humanitarian agencies and United Nations efforts in general regarding that very important field  Bosnia and Herzegovina has submitted to the membership a draft declaration relating to basic tenets of humanitarian action in emergency situations  contained in document A/60/627. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina seeks to contribute to progress in world preparedness for emergency situations on the basis of our own lessons learnt. I invite Member States to consider the adoption of the draft declaration and to continue to contribute to progress in such important activities globally.  In conclusion  I thank all members for the assistance and support that we received from the international community in years gone by and to express my hope that they will use their voices to support Bosnia and Herzegovina as a candidate for non-permanent Security Council membership. In so doing  they will contribute to Bosnia’s assumption of its place in international relations. Furthermore  I wish to thank Mr. Kofi Annan  on behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina  for his contribution and commitment to stability and prosperity in my country. He has confirmed his commitment by visiting us twice. "
"21",842,"BLR",61,2006,"It is generally considered that the struggle of ideologies has passed into history together with the collapse of the bipolar world order. Yet in reality the world continues a painful quest for a system of ideas that could ensure its security  justice and prosperity. The 2005 World Summit and the current General Assembly debate are good evidence of this quest. Nowhere else but on this rostrum does one have such an acute sense that ideas and the struggle for them are no abstract matter. They permeate the flesh and blood of millions and billions of people.     06-53609 16   I hope that many of those present will agree that free self-determination is the main ideology of the modern world. Is it not absolutely clear that as long as there is no independent Palestinian State  peacefully coexisting  with all its neighbours  and that as long as Iraq is not free from occupation  then terrorism and extremism will remain inevitable and invincible? Attempts to solve the problems of self-determination by violent measures  whether military or of any other kind  from the outside will result only in increasing the ranks of the ruthless disciples of terrorism and extremism.   In the modern world free self-determination is not only an issue of State independence and sovereignty. It is also an issue of recognizing — not in word  but in deed — a diversity of ways for countries and peoples to progress. We must provide the Palestinians  Iraqis  Lebanese and other peoples with the possibility of building their own homes in the way they want. Any help should come only then and in such manner as they wish  not as deemed appropriate by the ideologues of crusades in some capitals. There are no clever and foolish  no superior and inferior  no righteous and vicious peoples and religions; there are just people of the planet who are equally eager for happiness  uncomplicated and dignified.  The five years that have passed since 11 September 2001 have proved with painful clarity that ideology and the practice of crusades do not bring peace and democracy. They lead to the devastation of States  the destruction of the fabric of life of entire nations  and the death of children  women and innocent civilians. They also result in an upsurge of terrorism  swelling the ranks of its followers and supporters. In the same way  religious intolerance and the rejection of the beliefs and conventions of other people do not bring spiritual harmony and unity. They cause an outbreak of radicalism  fanaticism and extremism. Encouragement of religious tolerance within societies should become a responsibility of political and state leaders.   International security and global stability are inseparable from the solution of the world’s development problems. Security and development are inseparable. This is not some artificial linkage created in the halls of the United Nations. Its real nature has been clearly shown by the events in the suburbs of Paris. Are we  here in the General Assembly  and our colleagues in the capitals of the richest countries  waiting for an even more alarming signal? Are we waiting for the spiralling extremism caused by the lack of prospects for the future?   The situation is as clear as it can get. And it is clear that inadequate reflection of the priorities of development and development assistance in the 2005 World Summit Outcome document (resolution 60/1) was a serious mistake by the international community.   How can we correct this mistake? We can do so only by earnest and not hypocritical practical efforts to implement the Millennium Development Goals. Before too long we will see new proposals based on the results of the large-scale study on raising system-wide coherence and coordination of actions of the agencies of the United Nations system in the field of development assistance. Our task is to implement these important initiatives in deed.   The Millennium Development Goals are clear. None is easily achievable. These problems are too old and too deep-rooted to be solved by incremental and shallow methods. Nobody treats a dangerous infection with aspirin. A serious task requires serious tools. That is why the time has come for deep transformation of the Bretton Woods institutions. They were established in a different era and for different purposes. They should be changed and made to serve the cause of global development. A special role in making development a success and not a problem will belong to the Economic and Social Council  as the major United Nations coordinating body on development. Special responsibility will rest on the shoulders of the members of the Council.   Belarus is a candidate for membership of the Economic and Social Council for the period 2007-2009. I appeal to Member States to support Belarus in the elections to be held during the current session. The Assembly may rest assured that the Republic of Belarus will not fall short of its expectations. As a Member of the United Nations since 1945  Belarus has never wavered in its devotion to the purposes and principles of the Charter. As a member of the Non-Aligned Movement since 1998  Belarus stands actively and resolutely for the implementation of the goals and principles of the Movement and the practical strengthening of its role in international affairs.   Our responsibility and concern for the destiny of the world are sincere. There is much evidence to prove that. In its region the Republic of Belarus is a donor of   17 06-53609  international security. Belarus was the first country in the world to voluntarily renounce the possession of the nuclear weapons it had at its disposal.  Despite all the difficulties of the transition period  our country was among the first to respond to the plight of people struck by the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004  and provided humanitarian assistance to the disaster-stricken countries of south-east Asia. Nor was our country an indifferent spectator of the recent conflict in the Middle East. At the height of the hostilities Belarus invited children from war-ravaged States to come to Belarus for health rehabilitation.   The adherence of Belarus to the cause of development is also sincere and firm. Implementation of the international development agenda will be the indisputable priority of our work in the Economic and Social Council. What is most important is that we have the know-how to do it. Having been left 15 years ago  after the collapse of the Soviet Union  without natural resources and foreign markets  without a national currency and international assistance  we have achieved our economic and social objectives. They may be considered modest when compared to those of the most developed countries  but they are of critical importance as a stage in our movement forward  as evidence of what a medium-sized State can achieve in the most difficult of circumstances.  Among other hardships  we had to deal on our own with the Chernobyl disaster  whose radioactive contamination affected more than 20 per cent of our population and made it impossible to use more than 20 per cent of arable land and 30 per cent of forests. Chernobyl’s direct damage in Belarus alone is equivalent to 35 annual national budgets. It is more than appropriate to recall today  in the year of its twentieth anniversary  the largest man-made disaster in the history of mankind.   Having overcome a 50 per cent decline in the economy  and having rejected formulas that the International Monetary Fund tried to impose upon us  Belarus was the first country of the Commonwealth of Independent States to restore gross domestic product to its peak Soviet value and then raise the level to 120 per cent of that value. We have created a market economy with a strong social emphasis. We have preserved free education  including higher education  and health care  as well as the high quality and availability of social services for all people without exception. We have reduced unemployment to 1.5 per cent  and we are successfully curbing inflation.  I am confident that the experience  approach and knowledge of Belarus will be a useful contribution to the work of the Economic and Social Council on the Millennium Development Goals. If the majority of nations give us the credit of trust  we will most actively and persistently work for a stronger role for the Council in addressing the development challenges. Together with those who share these approaches  we will work to reform the social and economic sphere of the United Nations. Reform measures are not working yet. Without them the activity of different United Nations funds and programmes at country level can never be effective. To continue a “business as usual” approach in these matters would mean leaving the Millennium Development Goals on paper.   There is also a large debit balance in United Nations activities outside the Economic and Social Council. There has been no substantial movement towards the enhancement of the role of the General Assembly as a principal organ of the United Nations. So far there has been no progress in reorganizing the Security Council  a key element in United Nations reform. The sluggishness of the Security Council in addressing the situation in Lebanon has not only caused sorrow and frustration  but once again convinces us of the disparity between the Security Council and the image of the world as we know it today.   Having made right and important steps in the human rights area after the 2005 World Summit  the international community should take new actions at this session. They should be aimed at a true promotion of human rights and protection of the real victims of human rights violations  and not at getting even with disagreeable nations by abusing an unjust instrument of country-specific resolutions.   As a major step towards the practical promotion of human rights and the protection of victims of one of the most acute and painful phenomena of the modern world  Belarus has  together with a number of partners  elaborated a draft resolution on improving international coordination in fighting human trafficking  and will present it to the Assembly at this session. The global scale of that challenge requires from all of us not shallow talk  but truly coordinated and purposeful actions. We see the goal of these efforts as the    06-53609 18  elaboration of a United Nations strategy to fight human trafficking. I ask the Assembly to support the establishment of a systems-based approach to a global partnership against slavery and trafficking in human beings. Who else but the United Nations should care about the dozens  hundreds and perhaps millions of victims — above all  women and children — of modern slavery? Who else but the United Nations should encourage better international coordination in eradicating this phenomenon  which is an utter disgrace in our century?  At the World Summit many leaders spoke about the spirit of San Francisco. The spirit of San Francisco in 1944 and 1945 came from the sense of responsibility of nations in dealing with the problems of the world  not responsibility for their own narrow interests — that is obvious and simple — but for a common cause. That spirit became possible as a result of the huge disaster of the Second World War  with about 60 million deaths and the inconceivable suffering of hundreds of millions. Do we also need a huge disaster to restore that spirit? I am sure we do not. I hope that we have all learned the lessons of history.   After an era of romantic ideals and their tragic failure in the 1990s  mankind today is coming to a more elaborate perception of what kind of world order it needs. The Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana has demonstrated the clear aspiration of the majority of the nations of the world to move from the self-exhausted unipolar world to the multipolar world  fair and stable  based on the interdependence of diverse global and regional centres of power  to a world fit for all. The Havana Summit has shown that humanity should be humane. That should be the United Nations motto for a challenging twenty-first century. "
"22",877,"BLZ",61,2006,"I stand before the Assembly and renew the commitment of the Government and people of Belize to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We reaffirm the pledge made by the father of the Belizean nation  the Right Honourable George Price  when he said from this rostrum:    “Belize  with the help of God and the support of its people  will stand upright and will do its duty to help bring peace  stability and prosperity to our region and the wider circles of our planet Earth.” (A/36/PV.13  para. 143)  Through you  Sir  we would like to congratulate the President on her election and pledge the support of my delegation for our important work at this session of the General Assembly.  We express our solidarity with our Secretary-General  whose imprint on this institution at this critical time in international affairs will be appreciated and remembered through the ages.  Belize became independent 25 years ago. It was a different time then  in 1981. The cold war was being waged. There was a clash of economic philosophies  and countries were being forced to circle in one of two orbits. But many countries did not; we proclaimed our non-alignment and worked to establish a new international economic order. We sought to create a world which was fairer and more just and which put people at its centre.   We never achieved that dream of a new international economic order. In fact  in 1989  the wall that divided not only a nation  but the entire social and economic order of the world  came tumbling down. The Berlin Wall was torn down nearly two decades ago  but we have yet to tear down the most important wall of all — the one that separates us into rich States and poor States  wealthy and poor  developed and developing.   7 06-53615   Almost 15 years ago  we were told that if we tore down barriers to trade  opened up our markets to foreign capital and imported goods  and privatized our State-owned enterprises  our economies would grow by leaps and bounds. We were also told that our partners in the developed world would afford us greater access to their markets  that our commodities would receive fair prices  and that international financiers would make capital readily available for us to borrow.  The question we now ask is: Are we better off having adhered to that so-called development cocktail prescribed by the Washington Consensus?  All is not well. In the Caribbean  30 per cent of people are living in poverty. In Latin America  the figure is an obscene 40.6 per cent. Worse yet  16.8 per cent of the people in Latin America live in extreme poverty. Fourteen of the 15 Caribbean countries are among the most indebted emerging market countries. In fact  seven are in the top 10  all with debt-to-gross domestic product ratios of about 100 per cent. To quote from a recent World Bank report:  “A closer inspection of the data leaves little room for complacency about the world’s progress against poverty. Indeed  the picture that emerges is one of highly uneven progress  with serious setbacks in some regions and time periods. And we find that more people living near $2 per day became worse off over the period than the number who gained. Thus the number living under $2 per day rose.” In 2006  now more than ever we need a new international economic order.   In 2001  members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) adopted the Doha Development Agenda. The ministerial declaration proudly proclaimed:   “The majority of WTO members are developing countries. We seek to place their needs and interests at the heart of the Work Programme adopted in this Declaration.”  The WTO sought to design a multilateral trading system that was to “ensure that developing countries secure a share in the growth of world trade that was commensurate with the needs of their economic development”. But let me tell members what our reality  the Belizean experience with the WTO  has been.  Since Doha  a panel set up by the WTO decided that the European Union organization of its sugar market was incompatible with WTO rules. To solve that problem  Belizean sugar farmers now get paid less for the sugar exported to the European Union. Simply put  the WTO has made them worse off. Since Doha  the European Union has liberalized its banana import regime. That is supposed to make the regime WTO-compatible. The statistics now show that imports from non-African  Caribbean and Pacific countries into the European Union have outstripped imports from the Caribbean  and prices paid for bananas have fallen.  In the five years since Doha  our hopes have been dashed  ambitions smashed and the development dimension once again ignored. The accord reached at Doha has been systematically dismantled with each subsequent meeting  from Cancún to Hong Kong to Geneva.  We say that there is something inherently wrong with a system that promises development and delivers lower prices for exports. We say that there is something fundamentally unfair in a system that promises a development agenda and delivers suspended negotiations and less market access to small vulnerable economies.  It is in such an environment  defined by multilateralism and the primacy of the markets — liberalism writ large — that small States in the Caribbean operate. It is a system in which unknown people sitting in unmarked rooms in Brussels and Geneva make decisions that determine how many boxes of bananas the Caribbean can export to Europe and what price we get paid for our sugar.  At the end of the day  it is all about social justice and social equity. Is something wrong with a picture in which  of the 6 billion people on planet Earth  1 billion have more than 80 per cent of world income and 5 billion have less than 20 per cent? Something is radically wrong with that picture. Our common charge is to right that imbalance. The fight against poverty cannot and will not be won with arms and instruments of war. We need a new international economic order in which the rights of people to jobs and fair wages and to fair prices for commodities take precedence over rules of trade that are inherently unfair and inequitable. And small vulnerable economies like ours in the Caribbean need special and differential treatment. Unless we wage the fight against poverty  there will be no peace.    06-53615 8  In the absence of peace  insecurity prevails. Insecurity encourages instability.  It is no wonder that  at this time  we find ourselves in retreat  living in a culture of fear and divided by a so-called clash of civilizations. A general sense of lost hope is pervasive and the enthusiasm of the new millennium squandered.  Here at the United Nations  our own concept of dialogue among civilizations seems to be fast fading. We must find a way to build a greater sense of security  renew our faith in each other and deconstruct the walls that divide. That can best be accomplished through our work at the United Nations  and my delegation commends our efforts in endorsing an integrated approach to addressing the transition from conflict to recovery with the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. Together with the General Assembly and the Security Council  the Commission should  in the spirit of its constitution  help to answer those critical questions related to the maintenance of international peace and security and  above all  development.  In these times  when the rules that govern our collective responsibility to international civility and the comity of nations seem to be eroding along with respect for international law  we must look to our institutions to restore our common values.  We are reminded that the primary responsibility of the Security Council is the maintenance of international peace and security. The Charter  in giving that mandate  specifies that the conferral of that responsibility is to ensure prompt and effective action when required. But as we have seen with the delayed reaction to the recent events in Lebanon and the occupied Palestinian territories  the Council failed to discharge its mandate. The situation in the Middle East necessitates prompt and effective action.  We acknowledge that the shortcomings in the Council’s exercise of its mandate may be attributed to its structural imbalances. Those imbalances are not insurmountable and  indeed  call for reform. The Council must reflect the current geopolitical realities. Belize supports comprehensive reform of the Security Council  including the expansion of membership in both permanent and non-permanent categories  and through the improvement of its working methods. We detect a momentum for change and we are ready to engage as equal partners to that end.  We now have a Human Rights Council that we hope will be vigilant in its work to protect the rights of those unable to protect themselves. We will be truly civilized only when we stop the victimization of the weak at the expense of the ideology of the strongest.  We must bring to an end the violence and death of the innocent in Darfur. Our collective conscience is stained by the genocide in Darfur. For every innocent life that is lost to conflict and the denial of basic human rights  we carry the scars of their oppression.  In Belize  we have started a dialogue on the relevance of small States and the role we must play in the maintenance of international peace and security. I have invoked the idea that  in the global war on terrorism  we in the Caribbean and Central America are less important because we operate in a culture of peace and respect for life  and that because most of us lack the armies to join coalitions  we are seen as unwilling or even irrelevant.  Yet our people feel the same fear as those in larger countries; we suffer the economic effects that others suffer and  dare I say  more so because of our vulnerability due to our size. As people at risk  we want to see the billions spent to make war used to bring prosperity and hope to those who live in such despair that they can be enticed into the spreading of terror. We will not be dissuaded from our belief that violence and destruction beget war. Only hope and sustainable development can bear peace.  Today  in our sister Caribbean nation of Haiti  we see the resilience of its people. In the turbulence of the past few years  the people of Haiti have refused to despair. Their desire to live in a democratic society prevailed when they recently went to the polls to elect a new Government. We must not suffer Haiti to slide into irrelevance. We all owe Haiti our commitment to nurturing its growth by building those institutions necessary for a sustainable nation State.  At a time when the world has so much wealth that $900 billion is being spent on military expenditure and $300 billion on agricultural subsidies  but only $60 billion on development assistance  too many of our people remain under the strangulation of poverty  relegated to the dungeons of destitution and social inequality. Yet we come to these occasions and speak of our strong commitment to preserving the dignity of all human beings. We speak of their rights and promise to continue to foster dialogue. And when it comes right   9 06-53615  down to it  where the agreements count most the plight of the poor is sacrificed to the bottom line  personal wealth and political survival.  In the Caribbean  we cannot accept that and  while we applaud the efforts of this Organization and the work that has gone into defining agreed development goals  including addressing the needs of our poorest people  the protection of our environment and efforts to promote meaningful sustainable development  we must do more. Each child who goes to sleep hungry contributes to the shame we must all feel in failing to protect his or her basic rights. Each person who dies of HIV/AIDS is a reflection of our lost value for life  and every time the poor die for want of food we have failed humanity.  Twenty-five years ago  as a newly independent country  Belize was welcomed into the United Nations assured of its territorial integrity and its equal place in this community of nations. We earned our rightful place by example and by commitment to this Organization’s highest principles. In return  we received the solidarity of all.  Our political independence will remain imperfect until we find a peaceful and just solution to the territorial claim of Guatemala to Belizean territory. We remain committed to finding a solution that respects our territorial integrity and honours our sovereignty.  Membership in the United Nations is an affirmation of the will of sovereign peoples. The United Nations has served as a platform for the expression of that will for many of the nations represented here today. Let us in turn ensure that the United Nations remains a beacon of hope for all peoples who continue the struggle  such as our brothers and sisters in Palestine  Western Sahara  Taiwan and the non-self governing territories.  We warmly welcome Montenegro to the family of nations.  Our conversation began with my seeking answers to the question of the relevance of Belize and other small States in today’s global order. I find comfort in the winds of change occurring in our Organization  a change that will bring to this sixty-first session of the General Assembly a new Secretary-General  and that will continue the process of reform mandated in the World Summit Outcome. We must  however  make changes relevant to our time and true to our Charter.  Let us seize this opportunity and face the challenges boldly together. For us in Belize  our minds are imbued with the democratic process  our hearts beat with social justice and our souls cherish the treasures of the spirit. "
"23",924,"BOL",61,2006,"It is a source of great satisfaction to be here to represent my people  my homeland  Bolivia  and especially the indigenous movement. After more than 500 years of contempt and hatred for peoples once considered savages and animals — peoples who in some regions were condemned to extermination — we have come to right a historical wrong  to right the wrongs of 500 years  thanks to today’s awareness and the uprising and struggle for the rights of peoples.  During the period of the Republic  when we were also discriminated against and marginalized  the struggle of peoples for life and humanity was never taken into account. Over the past 20 years  through the application of an economic model  neo-liberalism  the plundering of our natural resources and the privatization of basic services continued. We are convinced that privatizing basic services is the best way to violate human rights.  Those minor considerations require us — and require me personally — to speak the truth here about the lives of families. I come to express this feeling for the humanity of peoples  of my people; I come to express the suffering caused by marginalization and exclusion; and  above all  I come to express the anti-colonial thoughts of peoples who are fighting for equality and justice.  In my country  we are beginning to seek profound democratic and peaceful change. We are in the process of identifying ways to recreate Bolivia in order to unite Bolivians; to recreate Bolivia in order to bring all the sectors and regions of my country closer together; to recreate Bolivia  but not to take revenge against anyone  although we have been subjected to discrimination; and  in particular  to recreate Bolivia to put an end to this contempt  this hatred for peoples. I say this because my mother told me that when she would go to the city  she did not have the right to walk in the main squares of my country’s cities; as recently as 30 or 40 years ago  she did not have the right to walk on the pavement.  Fortunately  however  we have decided to move beyond that social  labour and communal struggle to a new electoral struggle so that we ourselves can resolve social  economic and structural problems. We are casting our lot with the reform-minded Constituent Assembly. I would like the United Nations to participate in this process of peaceful and democratic change  which is the best thing that we could do for our abandoned and marginalized families.  Surely  many other countries have the same problems as my country  a nation with so much wealth but also so much poverty. Historically  our natural resources were stolen  plundered  sold off and delivered to transnational corporations by neo-liberal Governments. The time has come for those in the vanguard of the struggle of peoples for power and territory to recover those natural resources for the Bolivian State so that they can be under the people’s control.  When we talk about recovering our natural resources  they tell us  in this dirty campaign of accusations  that the Government of Evo Morales is not going to respect private property. I want to tell them that my Government will respect private property. It is true that we need investment; we need partners — not bosses  not owners of our natural resources. We understand perfectly well that an underdeveloped country needs investment.    06-52737 34   I would like to clear up for everyone a number of concerns and false accusations. If the Bolivian State exercises its property rights over natural resources such as natural gas  hydrocarbons and petroleum  we will not expel anyone or confiscate anything. Investors will be respected; indeed  they will be guaranteed a return on their investment and the right to make a profit. But they will not make fat profits as they did before  and then fail to resolve my country’s social problems.  I have not come to tell anyone how to govern. I have not come to threaten a country or to start to set conditions for a country. I wish only to ask that  as international organizations  as States with a spirit of solidarity  as nations with principles of reciprocity and brotherhood  all players participate in the process of moving towards democracy. We are very concerned that there be an awareness  in international forums such as the United Nations  of the need to work to bring about peaceful change.  All are aware  in North America in particular as well as in Europe  that many Bolivians are leaving their country to find work. It used to be Europeans who invaded Latin America  and especially Bolivia. Now  however  it seems that the situation has changed. It is the Latin Americans and the Bolivians who are invading Europe  as they did previously the United States. Why? Because  at the present time  there are no jobs. What is needed is fair trade  trade by peoples for peoples  trade that resolves employment problems.  Of course  trade by corporations is important  but trade by small producers is even more important. For the benefit of these cooperatives  these associations and these collectives  their products — not my brothers and sisters — are the ones that should go to Europe. That is what we wish to see. Greater awareness on the part of the international community is required if we wish to resolve the problem of migration.  Our brothers and sisters will not go take over thousands of hectares  as others did when they came to Latin America. They came to take our wealth and our resources. It is important to note that  even in my country  this so-called free trade is affecting major agribusiness concerns. As a consequence of the free trade agreement that Colombia signed with the United States  soy farmers  Bolivians  and even Colombian agribusiness concerns have lost market share. I am convinced that it is important to import what we do not produce and export what we do produce. That would resolve economic problems and the problem of unemployment.  I should like to take this opportunity to speak of another historical injustice: the criminalization of the coca leaf. This coca leaf is green  not white  like cocaine. The coca leaf is symbolic of Andean culture  of the Andean environment and of the hopes of peoples. It is not acceptable that the coca leaf be legal for Coca-Cola and illegal for medicinal consumption not only in our country but throughout the world.  The United Nations should be aware that scientific studies have been carried out in American and European universities that have shown that the coca leaf has no negative effects on human health. I am very sorry that because some have a drug habit  the coca leaf has become illegal. We are aware of that. That is why  as coca leaf producers  we have stated that there will not be unfettered coca leaf production  but neither will there be zero production. Conditionality-based policies implemented in the past focused on zero coca-leaf production. But zero coca-leaf production is equivalent to zero Quechuas  zero Aymarás  zero Mojeños  zero Chiquitanos. All of that ended with another Government. We are an underdeveloped country with economic problems resulting from the pillage of our natural resources. We are here today to begin to regain our dignity and the dignity of our country.  In that context  I wish to say that the best contribution to combating drug trafficking has been through an agreed  voluntary reduction  with no deaths or injuries. I was pleased to hear that the United Nations report recognizes the honest and responsible effort that has been made to combat drug trafficking. Drug seizures have increased 300 per cent. However  yesterday I heard the United States Government state that it would not accept coca cultivation and that it was imposing conditions on us so that we would change our system.  I want to say  with all due respect for the United States Government  that we are not going to change anything. We do not need blackmail or threats. The so-called certifications or de-certifications used in the combat against drug trafficking are simply an instrument for the recolonization or colonization of Andean countries. We will not accept or allow this.  We want  and need  an alliance to combat drug trafficking  but it must be genuine and effective. The   35 06-52737  war on drugs cannot be an instrument or a pretext to subjugate the Andean countries  just as the idea of preventive war was invented to intervene in certain countries of the Middle East. We must wage an effective battle against drug trafficking. I call on the United Nations and invite the Government of the United States to reach an agreement and to forge an effective alliance to combat drug trafficking. The war on drugs should not be used as an excuse or a pretext to dominate or humiliate us  or to try to establish military bases in our country under the pretext of combating the drug trade.  I should like also to take this opportunity  in the context of this process of change  to say that we want justice. That is important to our peoples. I believe that  through the Constituent Assembly  justice will be decolonized and nationalized. That will be true justice. As long as some violate others’ human rights  as long as peoples are threatened by military intervention  there will never be justice.  We are committed  as Presidents and heads of State  to safeguarding the dignity of humanity by putting an end to the impunity promoted by my country’s previous Governments and to the massacres of people demanding their economic rights and claiming their natural resources. It is not acceptable that the perpetrators of genocide and the most corrupt criminals can escape and move to the United States. With all due respect  I ask the United States  as a developed country  to expel those corrupt  genocidal criminals who are living there. If they have nothing to hide  why are they not defending themselves before the Bolivian judiciary?  I am obligated  as President  to ensure that they are tried by the Bolivian justice system. I do not believe that any country or any head of State can protect criminals or those who are guilty of genocide. I hope that  with the support of the American people  through international organizations  those responsible for so much economic damage and so many violations of human rights will be brought to justice  or there will never be respect for human rights.  I have been entrusted by the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to say the following. Previously  debates on the rights of indigenous peoples were held in the United Nations Sub-commission dealing with that issue  in Geneva  and in the framework of the Organization of American States (OAS). But I have been informed that the debate has now moved to this highest of bodies  the United Nations itself.  I call on the Assembly  on behalf of the indigenous peoples of the world  and particularly those of Abiallal — now known as America — urgently to adopt the declaration on the rights of the indigenous peoples of the world: the right to self-determination  the right to live in communities  and the right to live a life based on solidarity and reciprocity  and  above all  on brotherhood.  There are regions and communities where there is no private property  only community property. We indigenous peoples want  quite simply  to live well  not better. Living better means exploiting  pillaging  robbing  whereas living well is living peacefully in brotherhood. That is why it is extremely important for the United Nations  after the Decade of the Indigenous Peoples  to adopt as a matter of urgency the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  including the right to natural resources and the right to care for the environment.  We indigenous peoples  particularly the poor  are of the culture of life  not the culture of war. This millennium must really be about defending life and saving humanity. If we want to save humanity  we must save the planet Earth. We indigenous peoples live in harmony with Mother Earth  not only in reciprocity and solidarity with human beings. We are very sorry that hegemonistic policies and rivalries are destroying the planet Earth. I feel that it is important for all countries  societies and international organizations to begin to debate this subject truly  in order to save the planet Earth  to save humanity.  This new millennium in which we are living must be a millennium of life  not war  a millennium of the people  not of empire  a millennium of justice and equality; and all economic policies must be directed towards ending or at least reducing the so-called asymmetries or differences between countries and social inequalities. There is no question now of implementing policies that involve the economic humiliation or pillaging of others  whether with rules or with troops.  With all due respect  I wish to say that it is important for the troops to be withdrawn from Iraq  if we want to respect human rights. It is important to abandon economic policies that allow capital to be concentrated in just a few hands. I feel that these    06-52737 36  actions have to be of historic importance in order to change the world and to change economic models and interventionist policies. In particular  we want these to be times which enable us to defend and save humanity. "
"24",971,"BRA",61,2006,"When I first addressed the Assembly from this rostrum  in 2003  I stressed the need for urgent and relentless action to fight the scourge of hunger and poverty in the world. This is what we are doing in Brazil: we have combined economic stability with social inclusion policies; the standard of living of Brazilians has improved; employment and income have grown; the purchasing power of the minimum wage has increased. Our resources are scarce  but even so we have achieved surprising results.  The family stipend at the core of our zero-hunger programme assures a basic income to over 11 million Brazilian families. Well-fed people can enhance their dignity  their health and their learning capacity. Putting resources into social programmes is not expenditure; it is investment.  If we in Brazil have done so much with so little  imagine what could have been done on a global scale if the fight against hunger and poverty had been a real priority for the international community. Where there is hunger  there is no hope; there is only desolation and pain. Hunger nurtures violence and fanaticism. A world where people starve will never be safe.  The sheer size of the task will not daunt us  especially if we are not alone. All here know that some 840 million human beings — nearly one out of seven on the planet — do not have enough to eat.  An additional $50 billion each year are needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals on time. The international community can afford it. On the positive side  think  just for instance  of the hundreds of billions of dollars invested to move forward with the full integration of Eastern European countries into the European Union. Then  on the other hand  think of the cost of wars and other conflicts. Everyone here is aware that the second Gulf war has probably cost hundreds of billions of dollars to date. With much less    06-52731 6  we could change the sad reality of a large portion of the world’s population. We could alleviate the plight of those people and lift them out of destitution. We could save millions of lives.  However strong they are today  rich countries should have no illusions: nobody is safe in a world of injustice. War will never bring security; it can only generate horrors  bitterness  intolerance and fundamentalism and create damage associated with hegemonism. The poor must be given reasons to live  not to kill or die. Humanity’s greatness lies not in bellicosity  but in humanism  and there can be no true humanism without respect for the other.  There are  in fact  those who are different from us  but who are no less dignified  no less precious and no less entitled to the right to happiness  because we are all creatures of the same creator.  There can be security only in a world where all have the right to economic and social development. The true path to peace is shared development. If we do not want war to go global  justice must go global.  That is why  with the serene conviction of a man who has dedicated his life to fighting peacefully for the rights of working people  I say to the Assembly: the search for a new  fairer and more democratic world order is not only in the interests of poor or emerging nations; it is also — and perhaps to an even greater extent — in the interests of rich countries  so long as they have eyes to see and ears to hear  so long as they do not make the mistake of ignoring the haunting cry of the excluded.  We have seen some progress in the past few years. At the Summit of World Leaders in 2004  we launched the Action against Hunger and Poverty initiative. Together  we were able to achieve strong international engagement around that issue. Our collective efforts have begun to bear fruit. We are establishing innovative mechanisms  such as a solidarity levy on international air tickets.  Hunger and disease walk hand in hand. Therefore  we have joined with other Governments in establishing an International Drug Purchase Facility to combat AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria. That initiative will provide new sources of funding and facilitate access to medication at lower costs. We cannot shirk our responsibilities in this area.  That is why I salute the leaders of vision who are engaged in this war: the war against the debasement of human beings and against hopelessness. That is the only war in which final victory will mean a triumph for all of humanity.  The fight against hunger and poverty is based on the creation of a world order that gives priority to social and economic development. There will be permanent solutions to destitution only when poorer countries can make progress through their own efforts.  Once international trade is free and fair  it will be a valuable tool for wealth creation  income distribution and job creation. It is essential that we break the bonds of protectionism. Subsidies granted by richer countries  particularly in the area of agriculture  are oppressive shackles that limit progress and doom poor countries to backwardness. Time and again  I must repeat that  while trade-distorting support in developed countries amount to the outrageous sum of $1 billion a day  900 million people get by on less than $1 a day in poor and developing countries. That situation is politically and morally untenable.  The only thing worse than inaction stemming from ignorance is neglect born of accommodation. The old geography of international trade must be profoundly reshaped. Brazil  together with its partners in the Group of Twenty (G-20)  is engaged in that task. The creation of the G-20 has changed the dynamics of negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO): until recently  developing countries played only peripheral roles in the most important negotiations.  Eliminating the barriers that prevent poor countries from developing is an ethical duty of the international community. It is also the best way to ensure prosperity and security for all.  Today  for the first time in the history of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WTO system  the word “development” appears in the title of a round of trade negotiations. However  the Doha Development Agenda  which will decide the future of the world trade system  is now in crisis.  If they are successful  the WTO negotiations will help to pull many people out of extreme poverty. Farmers who cannot compete against multi-billion-dollar subsidies will at last have a chance to prosper. Poor African countries will finally be able to export their products. If the round fails  however  the fallout   7 06-52731  will extend far beyond trade. The credibility of the WTO system itself will be jeopardized  with negative political and social repercussions. Scourges such as organized crime  drug trafficking and terrorism will find fertile ground in which to proliferate.  I have called on world leaders to shoulder their responsibilities. The importance attached to this issue at the most recent summit of the Group of Eight has not yet produced practical results. Our generation has a unique opportunity to show the world that selfish interests will not prevail over the common good. History will not forgive us if we miss that opportunity. Fair trade  based on a solid consensus and on a transparent WTO that is aware of the needs of developing countries  is one of the pillars of the world order that we uphold.  In the field of international peace and security  another such pillar is the United Nations. Brazil is a staunch supporter of international organizations as forums for cooperation and dialogue. There is no more effective way to bring States together  to keep the peace  to protect human rights  to promote sustainable development and to work out negotiated solutions to common problems.  Conflicts such as that in the Middle East continue to challenge the authority of the United Nations. The recent crisis in Lebanon exposed the Organization to a dangerous erosion of credibility. The effectiveness of the United Nations is being seriously questioned. Unable to act when it is needed  the Security Council is accused of being lethargic.  World public opinion is impatient in the face of such incomprehensible difficulties. The deaths of innocent civilians — including women and children — have shocked all of us. In Brazil  millions of Arabs and Jews live together in harmony. Thus  Brazil’s interest in the Middle East stems from a profound objective social reality in our own country.  Apart from the countries directly involved  Middle Eastern issues have always been addressed exclusively by the major Powers. So far  they have found no solution. Thus  we might ask: is it not time to convene a broad-based conference under United Nations auspices  with the participation of countries of the region and others that could make a contribution on the basis of their successful experiences in living peacefully despite differences?  Brazil believes in dialogue. For that reason  we held a summit of South American and Arab countries in 2005. We also have good relations with Israel  whose birth as a State came about when a Brazilian  Oswaldo Aranha  was the President of the General Assembly. Conflicts among nations are not resolved only with money and weapons; ideas  values and feelings also have their place  particularly when they are based on real-life experiences.  More than ever before  the authority of the United Nations needs to be strengthened. We have already made significant progress through the administrative reform process and the establishment of both the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. But the task will remain irreparably incomplete without changes in the Security Council  the body responsible for overseeing issues related to peace.  Together with the other members of the Group of Four on Security Council reform  Brazil believes that any expansion of the Council must envisage the admission of developing countries as permanent members. That would make the Council more democratic  legitimate and representative. The great majority of Member States agree with that view and recognize the urgency of this matter.  We cannot deal with new problems using outdated structures. Sooner or later  we must open the way to democratizing international decision-making bodies. As the Secretary-General has said  we travel around the world preaching democracy to others; we must now apply democracy to ourselves and show that there is genuine representation in the political bodies of the United Nations.  South America is a priority for Brazilian foreign policy. Our region is our home. We are expanding the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and strengthening the South American Community of Nations. The future of Brazil is linked to that of its neighbours. A strong and united South America will contribute to the integration of Latin America and the Caribbean.  We also feel connected to the African continent by historical and cultural ties. As the country with the second-largest black population in the world  we are committed to sharing Africa’s challenges and its destiny. But regional matters are only part of the global problems we face.    06-52731 8   The fight against hunger and poverty  the breakdown of the Doha round and the stalemate in the Middle East are interconnected issues. The appropriate handling of these matters requires trust in negotiated solutions at the multilateral level.  This trust has now been shaken. This is extremely serious. The world order that it is our task to build must be based on justice and respect for international law. That is the only way to achieve peace  development and genuine democratic coexistence within the community of nations.  There is no lack of resources. What is missing is the political will to use them where they can make a difference. They can then turn despair into joy and find a reason to live. "
"25",1015,"BRB",61,2006,"I am pleased to join with preceding speakers in congratulating you on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. The fact that you are a woman makes me doubly happy. In 61 years you are only the    06-53329 14  third female President of the Assembly. Throughout your distinguished career  you have championed with determination and courage the cause of women’s rights  and I am confident that you will bring these and other outstanding qualities to your presidency. I pledge to you the fullest cooperation of the delegation of Barbados.  I would also wish to thank and congratulate your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his leadership at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly and in particular for the skill he demonstrated in that very challenging task.  I must also take this opportunity to say a special farewell on behalf of the Government and people of Barbados to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who has served this Organization with great skill and dedication over the past 10 years. The Secretary-General has had to face myriad challenges  and he has always found the strength of character  purpose and fortitude to craft appropriate solutions. Barbados wishes the Secretary-General well as he proceeds into retirement at the beginning of next year  and we look forward to welcoming him again to the beautiful shores of Barbados whenever he feels the need for some respite and recuperation.  I would also like at this time to welcome our newest Member  Montenegro  into the family of the United Nations.  In July this year  the formal return of Haiti to the councils of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) was greeted with great satisfaction by all. At that time  the CARICOM heads of Government pledged their full assistance to Haiti to facilitate efforts to promote that country’s development and renewal. We call on the international community to support the strengthening of democracy and the social and economic development of Haiti and to disburse in a timely manner the funds pledged for Haiti’s reinvigoration and development. We cannot afford to repeat past mistakes.  This session of the General Assembly provides an important first opportunity to review and assess the progress in the implementation of the decisions of the historic 2005 World Summit. At this juncture  it is Barbados’s opinion that the results are decidedly mixed. The reform agenda decided on at the World Summit  encompassed a broad spectrum of issues. We are pleased that progress has been made in areas such as the establishment of the Human Rights Council  the Peacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency Response Fund  the agreement on a counter-terrorism strategy and the revitalization of the General Assembly. We regret that progress on the cluster of development issues  which enjoyed broad consensus at the 2005 World Summit  has been painfully slow. Also  further work needs to be undertaken on Secretariat and management reform as well as on reform of the Security Council.  The primacy of development on the global agenda must be ensured. Barbados considers the initiative to select development as the theme for this general debate to be laudable. If we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015  the next ten years must be the decade of implementation  in which we collectively mobilize the will and resources needed. In this connection  we commend the Secretary-General for recommending a number of additional targets that would facilitate the monitoring of progress in the implementation of the Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1).  When I addressed this Assembly one year ago  I called for the adoption of a new target within the MDG framework on universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. Barbados thanks the Secretary-General for recognizing the critical link between sexual and reproductive health and rights and development  and we fully support his recommendation for a new target under Goal 6 of the MDGs. We are equally supportive of his other recommendations for new targets on universal access for treatment of HIV/AIDS by 2010 and on decent work and productive employment.  We would  too  like to see speedier implementation of the decisions on increased financial resources for development which were made last year at the Group of Eight (G-8) meeting at Gleneagles and at the World Summit. These resources are now needed urgently  particularly by those countries  like my own  that have prepared their comprehensive national development strategies to achieve the MDGs and other international development goals and objectives.  While the developing countries bear responsibility for their own development  national actions will not be sufficient to bring about their fuller participation in the global economy. These actions must be complemented by a supportive international   15 06-53329  system  the essential elements of which include improvement in global governance  more coherence in the operation of the United Nations system and a greater voice for the United Nations in the global development policy dialogue.  Changes in global governance have not kept pace with the growth of global interdependence  and far-reaching institutional changes are required to bring about a more effective system. We call for democratization of the governance of the international financial and trade systems and concrete steps to be taken to end the marginalization of developing countries and small economies in the policy formulation and decision-making processes in the multilateral  financial and trade institutions. Globalization must be made more inclusive and its benefits more equitably distributed.  Barbados also believes that improvement in global governance must be mirrored in the strengthening of the management and coordination of the United Nations operational activities at the country level. This will ensure delivery of better coordinated development assistance. It will lead to better absorption of aid by recipient countries and ultimately facilitate their attainment of the MDGs. Indeed  the United Nations must be developmentally holistic. We anxiously await the Secretary-General’s report on the work of the High-level Panel on this issue. A stronger United Nations voice in development led by a revitalized Economic and Social Council will also contribute to an improved international system. Barbados will continue to work with other Member States to adopt a resolution on reform of the Economic and Social Council at this sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  Permit me to focus for a few moments on the issue of trade; for there is nothing else more important for small developing countries than an improved multilateral trading system if we are to have the chance to participate in and benefit from the ongoing process of globalization. The failure of WTO talks to reach agreement on new commitments for trade reform in the agricultural and industrial goods sectors represents a very real crisis in international trade negotiations. The challenges of reforming trade in these areas are not insurmountable. We call on the developed countries to demonstrate a unity of purpose to resolve differences among themselves  remembering that this round of trade talks is about development  or more precisely about raising the standard of living of people in developing countries. Consistent with the theme of this year’s session of the Assembly  “Implementing a global partnership for development”  developed and developing countries must partner together to achieve a workable agreement.  If there is to be a successful outcome to the trade negotiations  a narrow focus on trade liberalization and enhanced market access alone will not be enough. For while it is important to have agreements that open up access to markets  it is even more essential for any negotiated trade agreement to contain provisions that would assist developing countries to implement policies aimed at transforming their economies. In other words  market access is meaningless without goods and services with which to trade.  An adjustment mechanism will be required to assist developing countries in coping with the loss of preferences  markets and the resultant reduction in financial resources during this most important transitional phase of their development. For the small and vulnerable economies this will mean some form of special and differential treatment to facilitate their full integration into the multilateral trading system.  Special and differential treatment should not be seen as a concession or as an exception to the rules  but rather as a concept based on the development and policy needs of countries at differing levels of development. It should consist of a broad mix of provisions and programmes that recognize and appreciate the characteristics of developing countries and the economic challenges that trade liberalization and globalization pose for them  and it should seek to address these factors genuinely. In the words of the Prime Minister of Barbados  The Right Honourable Owen Arthur  special and differential treatment is nothing more than reciprocity with flexibility. Among equals  equality; among unequals  proportionality.  During this session  the Assembly will return to a consideration of the agenda item on the Caribbean Sea. We appeal to the members of the international community to recognize the fragility of this precious shared natural resource of the Caribbean  and its importance for most of our present and future economic activity  and agree on measures that will need to be taken to recognize the Caribbean Sea as a special area within the context of sustainable development.    06-53329 16   Also during this Assembly session  the two hundredth anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade will be recognized. Barbados joins other delegations in requesting the Assembly to set aside a day in late March of next year to commemorate this important date. This will not only deepen our knowledge and understanding of slavery and the slave trade  but also contribute to the removal of all the vestiges of slavery.  Recent events suggest that we need to remain ever vigilant to threats of terrorism. They further remind us that once again we face increasing challenges to world peace and security. Barbados is of the view that there must be a concerted effort on the part of the international community to ensure that disputes among States do not continuously result in military action and loss of lives and that States remain faithful to the rules of humanitarian law and civilian rights.  The questioning of the efficacy of the United Nations has not abated in spite of the ongoing reform process  and the threat to multilateralism remains real. In this  our fortieth year of membership of the United Nations  Barbados reaffirms its faith in the Organization and proclaims its unwavering commitment to multilateralism. Over the past 40 years  Barbados has played its part in strengthening and widening the role of the United Nations to enable it to promote and protect human rights  to eradicate poverty and disease and to cultivate a global culture of peace.  Strengthening the role of the United Nations system in the management of global affairs and upholding and defending its moral authority remain key foreign policy priorities of the Government of Barbados. With the growing complexity and unpredictability of international affairs  especially in the context of globalization  and with the emergence of new challenges to peace and security  the fulfilment of the role of the United Nations remains critical. It is now more than ever that we need to strengthen the structures and institutions of the international system to safeguard our common interests in achieving a global order of peace and economic and social progress for all. We must all work together to reform this vital community of nations and ensure its pre-eminence in matters of development  human rights  and peace and security  and that it remains the principal forum for exercising multilateralism.  We are not at liberty to abstain from this task. "
"26",1047,"BRN",61,2006,"I extend my congratulations on your election  Madam  and my respects to His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa and to the Government and people of the Kingdom of Bahrain. I assure you of Brunei Darussalam’s full support in the coming year and wish you great success during your term of office.  I would also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his excellent leadership of the Assembly over the past year.  Finally  may I express my special appreciation to our Secretary-General. For many years  he has been the United Nations most public figure. That has never been easy  but he has served us with great distinction. His programmes of action have strengthened our voice. His personal leadership has inspired us  and I thank him most warmly for that.  During the past few years  we have regularly discussed United Nations reform  and I am sure that discussions will continue in the coming years. Therefore  at the opening of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  I would like to take this opportunity to mention a few of our own feelings in Brunei Darussalam about the question of United Nations reform.  I would like to start by acknowledging the fine work done for so many years by our United Nations agencies in the field  particularly by the World Health Organization  the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific  the United Nations Children’s Fund  the United Nations Development Programme  and the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  and by United Nations volunteers all over the world. Those agencies can truly be called our body’s life blood  and at times literally so. Every day of every year  they attempt to bring hope  confidence and meaning to the lives of ordinary people. They provide people with the simplest and most basic definition of security. By that  I mean that they give people a feeling that even the most severe problems can be faced and solved. I thank them with great respect for their dedication and their professionalism. They represent the United Nations at its best.  Consequently  I believe that any reform of our Organization should be considered with one crucial primary question in mind: Does it directly strengthen the work of our agencies and people in the field? That is becoming more and more important to the ordinary people we represent.  The new century has brought a host of new challenges. The past year  like every year of this new century  has presented problems that are typical of those the United Nations is increasingly going to face and expected to solve. They are  sadly  all the stuff of regular breaking news: natural and environmental disasters  health  economic and security disasters  countless political failures and the enormous human suffering that follows.  The immediate impression is a dramatic one. Our new century seems to be defining itself in images of disaster — landslides  earthquakes  tsunamis and terrorist bombings. The most lasting images are human ones. Those are the countless victims of events over which they had no control and of which they had no knowledge or warning. The long-term result is a deep sense of insecurity. It is reaching into the lives of every individual  every family and every community in every country we represent.  Many people are feeling so insecure that they are engaged in finding any way they can to salvage some hope for themselves. In Asia  Africa and the Americas  they are doing so in their hundreds of thousands. They are leaving their families and homelands to emigrate. They often put their lives at enormous personal risk in the search for somewhere where they hope to find hope.  That presents a bleak vision of the future for millions of our people. It would be even bleaker without the United Nations. Sometimes  in the refugee camps  in the disaster areas and in all the other arenas    06-53323 42  of destruction  the United Nations offers all they have by way of hope. Hence  the second consideration we give to proposals for reform is a human one. We ask a simple question: Is the proposal relevant to ordinary peoples’ personal lives and problems?   Those lives are increasingly dominated by the extremely complex challenges of our new century. Those challenges are global. They are scientific  technological  economic  environmental and political. They now involve over six and a half billion people. Those people are becoming more and more dependent on each other for survival. That means  I believe  that we must continue to stress the need for more than just administrative reform. So our third consideration regarding reform is practical.  Does the proposed reform reflect the current century  its priorities  its special challenges and its changing character? In other words  are we certain that we are not trying to solve twenty-first-century problems with the mechanisms  priorities and procedures of the twentieth century and sometimes even of the nineteenth century?  We look forward to continuing our discussions with colleagues in the coming year on this critical matter of effective and lasting reform. We are starting to see what the twenty-first century is presenting  both the good and the disturbing. We are also seeing the demands it is making on the United Nations. They are considerable. We believe  however  that the considerations I have mentioned are the essential basis for reforming the United Nations in a manner that will ensure that our world body is well capable of meeting the twenty-first century on twenty-first century terms.

"27",1088,"BTN",61,2006,"I have the honour to convey to the General Assembly the warm greetings of His Majesty King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of Bhutan  as well as his best wishes for the success of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. I would also like to congratulate you  Madam President  on your unanimous election as the President of the Assembly. Your election is a reflection of the General Assembly’s confidence in your personal abilities and the high esteem that the Kingdom of Bahrain enjoys. My country has fond memories of 21 September 1971  when our two Kingdoms became proud members of the United Nations. My delegation also wishes to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the exemplary manner in which he directed the work of the sixtieth session. Under his stewardship  a number of important decisions of the 2005 World Summit were implemented. We are confident that  under your dynamic leadership  Madam President  the sixty-first will be able to successfully complete all its tasks. Bhutan is honoured to serve as one of the Vice-Presidents. We assure you of our full cooperation and support.  We fully support the theme for the general debate  “Implementing a global partnership for development”. In this era of globalization and technological advances that have brought unprecedented prosperity to a minority of the world’s population  the international community must unite forces to extricate the vast majority of the world’s inhabitants from the vicious circle of poverty and destitution. The global partnership must engender greater political will to address the problems of trade  market access  technology transfer and a host of other issues that impede growth and development in developing countries. It is also imperative that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits  especially those relating to development  are fully implemented by all.  The Midterm Comprehensive Global Review of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least    06-53317 16  Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010  which was undertaken earlier this week  has revealed much less progress than desired. It is my delegation’s hope that  as provided in the declaration that was adopted by the review meeting  all stakeholders will genuinely commit themselves to the special needs of the least developed countries and work towards the full implementation of the Programme of Action  which constitutes a fundamental framework for strong global partnership to accelerate sustained economic growth  sustainable development and poverty eradication in the least developed countries (LDCs).  Owing to the limited prospects for raising domestic resources  attracting foreign investment and securing funds on commercial terms  official development assistance (ODA) is a critical resource for LDCs in achieving the goals and targets of the Brussels Programme of Action. In fact  for many LDCs  such as mine  ODA constitutes the primary resource for development. My delegation therefore appeals to all developed countries to abide by their aid commitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to ODA  with 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of that earmarked for least developed countries.  A summit meeting of landlocked developing countries was held on 14 September in Havana  Cuba. That was the first-ever summit meeting of landlocked developing countries and it highlighted the serious constraints faced by landlocked developing countries. It is our hope that the international community will duly consider the problems of landlocked developing countries and support the road map for global partnership set out by the Almaty Programme of Action.  The task of reforming the United Nations remains incomplete  in view of the slow progress in areas such as the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council and the reform of the Security Council. It is not enough to say that the reform of those bodies is required  while we allow ourselves to be constrained by other considerations. We need to strengthen the Economic and Social Council to enable it to deal effectively with the social  economic and development issues that are of primary concern for the vast majority of Member States.  The Security Council needs to be reformed to reflect today’s realities and challenges. My delegation strongly believes that the status quo is no longer an option. The Security Council has to be urgently reformed in all its aspects  including its composition and working methods. It is regrettable that the proposal submitted by the Group of Four at the sixtieth session was not acted upon. It is my delegation’s hope that the sixty-first session will be able to bring about real reform of the Security Council.  We welcome the adoption by the sixtieth session of the resolution on the revitalization of the General Assembly. We must continue with our efforts to further enhance the role  authority  effectiveness and efficiency of this body  which is the chief deliberative  policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations.  Terrorism continues to threaten peace  security and development in many parts of the world.  The recent train bombings in Mumbai  India  and the plot to blow up transatlantic aircraft uncovered in London last August remind us of the need to take strong measures against international terrorism. In that regard  my delegation welcomes the General Assembly’s adoption at its sixtieth session of the United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). The next important steps are to implement the Strategy and to renew efforts to conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  Recent developments in the Middle East once again highlight the urgency of finding a solution to the problem there. My delegation calls upon all concerned parties and others in a position to help to strive for a just and comprehensive solution.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my country’s deep appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his dedicated service to the United Nations as its Secretary-General. We are confident that the next Secretary-General  who should be from Asia  will lead the United Nations to greater heights in the service of humankind.  Allow me to take a few moments to apprise the international community of the progress that Bhutan is making. As a small  least developed country with a population of just over half a million people  the hurdles we face are enormous. Yet  under the far-sighted leadership of His Majesty the King  the country has been making significant progress in all fields.   17 06-53317   On the political front  most notable is the culmination of the reforms that will usher in parliamentary democracy in 2008. Those changes are taking place in an environment of peace  progress and stability. We are hopeful that the transition will be smooth and the final outcome enduring.  Bhutan’s development is guided by the conviction that human well-being and contentment must be promoted through the pursuit of material progress  on the one hand  and the fulfilment of spiritual and emotional needs  on the other. That development philosophy  as I have stated before in the Assembly  is defined as the pursuit of gross national happiness  rather than just gross national product. We will be happy to share our experience on that development philosophy  as we did at the international conference on the theme “Rethinking development: local pathways to global well-being”  which was held in Nova Scotia  Canada  in June 2005. We believe that the happy planet index that was recently published in the United Kingdom by the New Economics Foundation bears close a relation to the development paradigm pursued by Bhutan.  I wish the General Assembly every success. "
"28",1129,"BWA",61,2006,"Let me begin by congratulating you  Madam  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your election is a demonstration of the trust and confidence placed in you and your country  the Kingdom of Bahrain  by the international community.  I would also seize this opportunity to pay tribute to your illustrious predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of the Kingdom of Sweden  for his sound leadership and achievements during the sixtieth session.   Additionally  let me commend the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his decade of devoted and selfless service to humanity. This great son of Africa  with his visionary leadership of the United Nations  has provided  and continues to provide  the embodiment of our collective aspirations to achieve a more peaceful  just  equitable and prosperous world. He is indeed Africa’s great gift to humanity.  Within the next five days  Botswana will mark 40 years of its existence as a democratic  independent and sovereign nation.  When the first President of Botswana  the late Sir Seretse Khama  addressed the Assembly on 24 September 1969  he described Botswana  in part  as a country faced with a problem of underdevelopment of classic proportions.  Botswana had to contend with the harsh realities of its history and geographical position. We were completely surrounded by oppressive  aggressive and racist white minority regimes. As a small  weak and poor country  we had to begin the process of building national institutions and laying the foundation for social and economic development in a very hostile environment. The United Nations and its Member States served as a pillar of strength and gave us political and diplomatic support.  Standing here today  we express our deep gratitude for the support and assistance extended to us over the years. It has been a 40-year journey of determined and sustained effort to achieve human-centred development.  It is a journey we have travelled with development partners from all continents. This has enabled us to achieve some measure of progress in improving the human condition. At 40  we are an adult nation and have assumed full ownership of and responsibility for our own development. We have adopted policies  legislation and practices aimed at    06-53341 2  creating an environment conducive to economic growth and development.  Many milestones have been achieved in our national development effort. Today  Botswana is a middle-income developing country  but we still face enormous challenges for which we need assistance. In this regard  the decision of the 2005 World Summit should be implemented to ensure that small middle-income developing countries such as Botswana do not fall back into the doldrums of poverty and underdevelopment.  Botswana has been blessed with one of Africa’s major natural resources: diamonds. It must be stated that 65 per cent of the world’s diamonds  worth $8.3 billion per year  come from African countries. I am pleased to state that diamonds have done  and continue to do  good in Botswana. The diamond industry in Botswana has been at the cutting edge of human development and is transforming lives for the better  in all fields of human endeavour.  We continue to prudently manage the revenue from the sale of diamonds and to effectively use such revenue to educate our people  provide potable water and health care and build an infrastructure network  including roads  telephones and rural electrification. This is the good that diamonds have done and continue to do.  As a participant in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme  of which we currently hold the chairmanship  Botswana is strongly committed to working alongside other participating countries to maintain the credibility of the Scheme and the legitimate diamond trade. The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is one of the best examples of global cooperation. The Scheme is the embodiment of global consensus  unrelenting political will and the determination of members to do the right thing  underpinned by strong support and the resolutions of the Security Council. That is important  because about 10 million people globally are either directly or indirectly supported by the diamond industry. In southern Africa  more than 28 000 people are employed by the industry.  We are also here to reaffirm our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and our strong belief in the Organization as the only vehicle by means of which the enduring peace and prosperity of the human race can be assured. We welcome the opportunity for the nations of the world to meet here annually to exchange views on matters which are central to our common destiny.  There are many challenges which we must address. But chief among them is ending the evil of war. It is deeply regrettable that  although the human species left the jungle many  many years ago  the jungle remains in human beings. As a matter of fact  if the beasts of the jungle acquired language  they could actually claim some superiority over the human race. While animals may fight and brutally kill each other  they never spend time planning how to destroy one another or thinking about how to produce weapons of mass destruction.  Be that as it may  we still have hope and confidence in the human spirit to do good. As human beings  we have a shared destiny and we are therefore our own saviours.  The responsibility to save the human species from the scourge of war cannot be passed to anyone else. It is for that reason that we consider that this Assembly provides a rare opportunity for the international community to move beyond platitudes and to squarely address the critical challenges of our time.  An atmosphere of international peace and security is essential for human development. Experience has repeatedly shown that we cannot realistically hope to pursue a meaningful global development agenda under conditions of war  conflict and insecurity.  Conflicts in our world today should therefore be a matter of grave concern to all of us. In 2000  at the dawn of the new millennium  we gave an undertaking that  above all else  the twenty-first century should be an epoch of peace and prosperity. We consciously made a commitment to reduce by half by 2015 the number of the world’s poor. If we are to achieve that objective  war should certainly be the first casualty.  Botswana is particularly concerned about conflicts in Africa. Regrettably  Africa is the only continent that is facing the bleak prospect of failing to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Can we really afford the resources for war in the midst of poverty  disease  deprivation and underdevelopment? The answer must obviously be a resounding “No”.   3 06-53341   Today  Africa is host to the largest number of refugees  displaced persons  global poor and people infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Yet  sadly  we have the lion’s share of the world’s conflicts. Ending conflicts is therefore as much a calling as it is a moral and political imperative.  We should all be concerned about the atrocities in the Darfur region of the Sudan. The perpetuation of that conflict  in defiance of the collective will of the international community and the Charter of the United Nations  is totally unacceptable. Worse still  the carnage of daily killings is an affront to the sanctity of human life. This undermines our humanity.  We call on all parties to the conflict to comply with and respect the Darfur Peace Agreement. Those who have not signed the Agreement must do so as a matter of urgency. It is only through dialogue and mutual accommodation that durable peace can be attained. War can beget only misery and anarchy.  The United Nations has expressed its desire to help  through the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force. In principle  the African Union Peace and Security Council has welcomed the decision of the Security Council.  Every year we come to this rostrum to call for progress in the Middle East peace process. For generations that region has known no peace. If there is any lesson to be learned  it is that the only avenue to a lasting political settlement is through dialogue  accommodation and compromise. It is only in an atmosphere of negotiation that reason and common sense can prevail over extremism and war-mongering.  Israel and Palestine must coexist as sovereign States that share  not only a border  but a desire for peace  security and prosperity. We urge the people of the Middle East to summon up the courage to recognize the folly of war and accept the virtue of dialogue. They should start building a common future for generations that will know no violence and conflict  but only cooperation and concord.  My delegation shares the concern about the threat of terrorism. Terrorism pervades every crevice of our world  much to the detriment of humanity. In this respect  we welcome the recent adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) by the General Assembly.  When the Doha Ministerial Declaration was adopted in 2001  we had hoped for and envisaged negotiations lasting three years. We knew then  as we know today  that that was an ambitious and onerous undertaking. We have already missed several important deadlines. That should be a source of concern for all of us. For many of our people  a fair and equitable international trading system is not only a noble objective  but also a development imperative. It holds hope and promise of prosperity and the alleviation of poverty  which is all the more reason why we must not allow the Doha round of trade negotiations to fail.  The indefinite suspension of the Doha round of trade negotiations on 24 July 2006 has raised questions about our collective commitment to development. In this respect  the major question before us today is how we can revive the Doha round of trade negotiations. It took eight years to complete the Uruguay round. That goes to show that at times it is not how fast the negotiations are concluded but the substance and content of such negotiations. It is clear that we are going to miss the December 2006 deadline which we set for ourselves in 2005.  It is therefore our collective responsibility as the United Nations to give the necessary political direction to the World Trade Organization  not only to revive the negotiations  but also to ensure the necessary impetus for their timely and successful conclusion. A successful conclusion should address the ever-growing special development challenges of developing countries by upholding the development dimension of the Doha round.  During the sixtieth session of the General Assembly  a number of key decisions were made and were outlined in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). Heads of State or Government called for the establishment of institutions with a view to making the United Nations more effective in carrying out its mandate under the Charter and in serving Member States better.  This session should be an implementation session; we must commit ourselves to collective implementation. It is important that we demonstrate in deeds that  here at the United Nations  we make statements to communicate thoughts  ideas and action plans. Such ideas are not to remain on paper; they must be translated into programmes and projects for the common good.    06-53341 4   Botswana strongly supports comprehensive  wide and deep reform of the United Nations. Regarding the ongoing management reform  we welcome the decision  in resolution 60/283  to allow the Secretary-General adequate authority to deploy resources and staff from lower to higher priority programmes. We are convinced that as chief administrative officer  the Secretary-General should be accorded more leverage to command both human and financial resources so that the Secretariat can deliver more effectively. Member States must recognize the importance of timely and unconditional funding of the mandates entrusted to the Secretary-General by the legislative bodies of the Organization. It is incumbent upon the Secretariat to ensure accountability and the prudent management of such resources.  Enabling the Organization to effectively deliver is a collective responsibility of the Member States and the Secretariat. What is essential is for Member States to ensure that there are efficient oversight bodies to guarantee compliance with standing rules and regulations.  One of the major successes of the sixtieth session was the implementation of the World Summit decision on the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. Africa expects the Peacebuilding Commission to effectively discharge its mandate.  The establishment of the Human Rights Council is also one of the significant achievements of the sixtieth session. It demonstrates our collective desire to elevate human rights to new heights of prominence and visibility consistent with the changing times. It is our expectation that the new body will operate on the basis of principles of cooperation  genuine interactive dialogue and tolerance coupled with respect for diversity. The importance of issues of development should not be underestimated. In developing countries  these issues are real challenges which should not be overlooked. The Human Rights Council must therefore address issues of capacity building and find ways of responding to institutional weaknesses and resource limitations which hamper the process of translating constitutional and statutory human rights provisions into reality.  Let me conclude by reaffirming Botswana’s abiding faith in the utility and universality of the United Nations. The United Nations is nothing else but ourselves  the Member States  put together. It should be greater than the sum total of all of us. We must therefore have the courage to strengthen ourselves by following through with reforms  including the reform of the Security Council. The reform of the Security Council should not pose difficulties to anyone. We are all responsible for keeping this world safe.  It is only when Member States consider their national interests to be an integral part of the wider interests of the international community that they can set aside their apprehension with regard to a Security Council enlarged in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. "
"29",1172,"CAF",61,2006,"As you know  Madam President  there is one African tradition  but its forms are many. That is why the African continent is the cradle of mankind and this African tradition universal. We can see this universal nature here in New York within this forum of the United Nations where the values of solidarity and brotherhood symbolize a common desire for peace and love.   How can we not fail today to recall the vitality which marked the World Summit which was held in 2005 in this very Hall  following the fifty-ninth session  which was undoubtedly the longest ever due to the intensity of the consultations begun by His Excellency Mr. Jean Ping  President at that session  with a view to reaching a consensus on questions related to reform of our Organization  including that of the Security Council. Those questions divided  and continue to divide  delegations and regional groups  and finally overshadowed the discussion of other items.   But the Summit and the ensuing sixtieth session nonetheless had the merit of establishing the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission.   Despite all the differences among United Nations Members and despite the criticism of some of its actions  the United Nations remains the international organization which  due to its universality  representativity and authority  cannot be ignored. The Central African Republic  which reiterates its commitment to the purposes and principles of the   5 06-53341  Charter  would like to reaffirm its ongoing desire to continue to contribute to all efforts to reform the entire United Nations system.  Having said that  I should like  on behalf of His Excellency General François Bozizé  President of the Republic  head of State  and on behalf of the Government and the people of the Central African Republic  to warmly congratulate you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at the present session. I view it as a sign of confidence and a well-deserved tribute to your beautiful country  the Kingdom of Bahrain. I am also pleased to express to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  my high esteem for the remarkable way in which he led the work of the sixtieth session. In addition  I express my warm and sincere thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  a worthy son of the African tradition  for his praiseworthy and tireless efforts  in a particularly difficult international context  to promote the role of the Organization  to attain its objectives and to promote peace and security throughout the world.  The theme suggested for the present session is “Implementing a Global Partnership for Development”. We should recall that  six years ago  the highest leaders of the Organization’s Member States made the firm commitment to unite their efforts to collectively fight poverty and all the scourges it causes  which pose a serious threat to international peace and security and a major obstacle to the development processes in many countries.   In the Millennium Declaration  which resulted from that commitment  the 189 signatory countries — including the Central African Republic — solemnly pledged to do their utmost to overcome poverty  which continues to devastate the majority of the world’s population. To that end  several Goals were defined.  Ms. Blum (Colombia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  As the Secretary-General has stated  the main Goals have been implemented to varying degrees:  “Accordingly  we will not enjoy development without security  we will not enjoy security without development  and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights. Unless all these causes are advanced  none will succeed” (A/59/2005  para. 17).  In the case of the Central African Republic  we must acknowledge that many challenges remain to be addressed if we are to truly strive to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) within the agreed time frame. Indeed  my country experienced more than two decades of serious crises  from which we only recently emerged by holding general elections and establishing republican institutions and the Government of National Reconciliation. But we must still fight the cross-border insecurity raging in the subregion and push back out of our territory the aggressors  supported from abroad  who seek to destroy our democratically established republican institutions.   The Central African authorities are striving to restore security throughout the territory. It goes without saying that no development is possible unless we eradicate the endemic insecurity maintained by those who set up roadblocks and by the rebellion raging mainly in the north-eastern part of the country  bordering on the Sudan and Chad. The security and defence forces deployed in the back country face many difficulties — particularly logistical ones — in overcoming that phenomenon. The proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the subregion — due to the long crisis in Darfur and its effects on the Central African Republic — are hardly helping to put an end to that scourge.  The Central African Republic supports the proposals made by Presidents George Bush and Jacques Chirac and by the Chairperson of the African Union  Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso  on the positioning of United Nations troops on the border between the Central African Republic  Chad and the Sudan.   In addition  since 2003  the Central African Republic  one of the seven countries in partnership with the World Bank’s Multi-country Demobilization and Reintegration Programme  has taken a new comprehensive  integrated approach that is integrative and inclusive aimed at resolving the thorny problem of the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration of former combatants. The results today reflect the Government’s willingness to succeed in that process. Moreover  our country has just developed a new structure to fight the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  namely  a national commission against the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons and for disarmament.    06-53341 6   The deteriorated state of the Central African economy is hardly likely to encourage the implementation of the Development Goals in order to promote a robust fight against poverty  which for us remains an ongoing threat to peace and stability.   In the area of finance  the Government has taken energetic measures to restore financial health by implementing an extensive system to monitor civil servants and establishing a body to verify their academic credentials.   The other challenges — just as great — facing the Central African Republic are those of health care and education  which are among the main MDGs. With respect to health care  the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other diseases  such as tuberculosis and malaria  are sources of concern for our country.   The recent conference on AIDS  held here at United Nations Headquarters in early June 2006  highlighted the particularly disturbing characteristics of that calamity among the most impoverished sectors of the population: women and children. There is a health emergency  and thus the Central African Republic is requesting greater assistance and action from its development partners.  The education and training sector — covered by Goal 2 of the MDGs — has undoubtedly been the main victim of the long period of political and military crises  whose wounds are gradually healing. The many empty years of discouragement resulting from the loss of motivation on the part of the teaching staff  delayed salary payments  the lack of State resources to build schools and purchase equipment  and the continued insecurity in some areas of the country for the past several years — all of that has led to a decline in the quality of teaching and a drop in the literacy rate.  However  since the burst of patriotism of 15 March 2003  the Government has been doing its utmost to ensure that the school year will no longer be interrupted and to restore the former credibility of the Central African educational system. Thanks to the assistance of certain donors — among which we must mention the International Organization of la Francophonie — the Central African Republic is beginning to take up the challenge between now and 2015. Indeed  it will not be possible to ensure that democracy and a culture of dialogue and tolerance are firmly established unless the people have access to quality education and are able to grasp what is truly at stake  and thus make sound judgements in full knowledge of the facts.  The United Nations Millennium Development Goals Report 2005 highlights the need to ensure a sustainable environment by intelligently exploiting natural resources and protecting the ecosystems upon which the survival of humanity depends. Climate change and global warming owing to the depletion of the ozone layer are worrisome phenomena for our country  whose northern region is being increasingly overtaken by desert. The initiatives set out in the Kyoto Protocol show that progress is possible if there is political will on the part of the major consumers.   If we are to prevent and reduce the risks related to natural disasters and to equip ourselves with better organization and more effective means to make the world safer  we must support the transformation of the United Nations Environmental Programme into a specialized agency with a broader mandate  as proposed by France.  Despite delays in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the Central African Republic is determined to reach them  especially Goals 3 and 4  relating to the empowerment of women and the promotion of gender equality and to the reduction of under-five mortality. Indeed  considerable progress has been made in terms of vaccination coverage and also with respect to the free distribution of mosquito nets to pregnant women and to children under the age of 5.   The Central African Republic greatly appreciates the proposals made during the 2005 World Summit by Presidents Chirac  Lula Da Silva and Hu Jintao regarding the promotion of peace  security and development.   However  the results of MDG implementation will remain mixed until international solidarity fully plays its part. We live in an interdependent world; the development of the Central African Republic is closely linked to that of the rest of the world  because the United Nations is a community of nations.   May God bless the United Nations. May God bless the Central African Republic.  "
"30",1219,"CAN",61,2006,"It is a great honour for me  as Prime Minister of Canada  to   21 06-52988  speak to the Assembly today about the important issues confronting us as Members of the United Nations. (spoke in English)  The United Nations was born from a combination of the essential needs of nations for stability and security and the higher ideals to which we should all aspire — freedom  democracy  human rights and the rule of law. (spoke in French)  Our responsibilities in this Organization are as varied as they are important  and I cannot mention them all  nor do each the justice they deserve. (spoke in English)  Nor can Canada be effective by diffusing our efforts across all of these matters. We must focus our considerable  but limited  resources where we can make a real difference. So let me turn to one particular and key area where global interests and higher purpose come directly together: the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.  The United Nations recognized shortly after the attacks of 11 September 2001 that the Taliban regime  by its promotion of terrorism  was a threat to international peace and security. (spoke in French)  Kofi Annan  our Secretary-General  whom we thank for his 10 years of loyal service  summed up in a few words the reason why we must combat terrorism. Terrorism  he said:  “is a direct attack on the core values the United Nations stands for: the rule of law; the protection of civilians; mutual respect between people of different faiths and cultures; and peaceful resolution of conflicts.” (spoke in English)  That is why we in the United Nations have the responsibility to defeat terrorism. That is why  with unity and determination  the United Nations undertook its responsibility and its role in Afghanistan. And that is why Canada  which lost 24 of its own citizens on 9/11  answered the call.  And there we are. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan is the United Nations single largest political mission. It is also  by far  Canada’s biggest and most important overseas mission. So the United Nations mission is Canada’s mission.  No fewer than 19 United Nations agencies are in Afghanistan. They are working tirelessly to help the Afghan people and their national Government shake off the perpetrators of terrorism and build a democratic and secure society.  At the same time  approximately 20 000 troops from 37 countries — roughly 2 500 Canadians included — are contributing to military efforts to help stabilize Afghanistan and eliminate the remnants of the Taliban regime. And we want to do that once and for all. (spoke in French)  All our actions in Afghanistan — civilian and military — are being taken in accordance with the mandate of the Security Council. In short  we all stand together with the democratically elected Government of Afghanistan under the banner of the Organization that represents our collective will. In Afghanistan the United Nations mission is Canada’s mission. (spoke in English)  Let us be realistic. The challenges facing Afghanistan are enormous. There will be no quick fixes. Moreover  success cannot be assured by military means alone. This we all recognize. For success also requires a strong and unwavering civilian contribution: educators  engineers  elections advisers  direct and technical aid. The list is lengthy  but the contributions are essential.  That is why Canada is engaged in work like the rebuilding of girls’ schools  ripped down and destroyed by the Taliban in their frenzy of hate. (spoke in French)  That is why last spring we increased our development assistance  raising Canada’s total contribution to nearly $1 billion over 10 years  to assist the people of Afghanistan. (spoke in English)  These two actions — rebuilding a shattered society and providing a stable security environment — go hand in glove. And we are making progress — of that there is no doubt: 5 million refugees repatriated; over 5 million children enrolled in primary schools;     06-52988 22  10 million Afghans registered to vote in successive democratic elections.  More than one quarter of the seats in Afghanistan’s legislature are now held by women — remarkable in a nation where a few short years ago girls could not attend school and women had no human rights of any kind.  The success of this Mission  in providing both security and development  is vital to the safety  livelihood and very future of the Afghan people  but it is also vital to the health and future of this Organization. (spoke in French)  Let us recall that the democratically elected Government of Afghanistan  led by President Karzai  requested the assistance of the United Nations and its Member States in the struggle against terror  intimidation  violence and oppression. (spoke in English)  We have responded. But we have not made Afghanistan’s progress irreversible — not yet. Canadian defence personnel  diplomats and development officers are on the front lines of the fight for the future of Afghanistan. Canadians feel tremendous pride in the leadership role they have assumed  and we share equal grief for the casualties they have taken. We are therefore acutely aware that the United Nations job in Afghanistan is not yet done. We have no illusions about the difficulties that still lie before us. Difficulties do not daunt us. But lack of common purpose and will in this body would.  After all  if we fail the Afghan people  we will be failing ourselves. For this is the United Nations strongest Mission and therefore our greatest test. Our collective will and credibility are being judged. We cannot afford to fail. We will succeed. (spoke in French)  The United Nations is also facing other challenges — in Haiti  for example. Canada has played an important role there  dispatching troops  police and development officers to support United Nations activities aimed at restoring stability and establishing democracy. And we are offering the country  $100 million in economic development assistance. However  we must act together to ensure that our multinational force paves the way for stability and progress  and empowers the Government of Haiti to help its citizens  the poorest in the western hemisphere. (spoke in English)  Darfur  too  is a significant challenge  as multinational security efforts are transferred from the African Union to the United Nations. It is also a test of the principle that this body endorsed last year — the responsibility to protect. The United Nations has authorized a mission there  with a robust mandate. But will the Government of Sudan accept it?  In the Middle East  Canada has joined the international community in the reconstruction of Lebanon. But will the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ensure security on Israel’s northern border and lead to progress in the Middle East peace process?  Nuclear proliferation threatens us all. Are we prepared to ensure that Security Council decisions will be implemented fully? Will we act to halt activities that have no reasonable purpose other than the acquisition of nuclear weapons?  These are some of the tests the whole world must face. And there are other challenges internal to this Organization.  Will the new Human Rights Council become a forum where human rights are genuinely put above political maneuvering? Or will it emulate the fate of its failed predecessor organization? I must say that the early signals suggest that too little has changed and that the page has not yet been turned.  And what will be done to make progress on United Nations management reform? (spoke in French)  Earlier this year Canada’s new Government was given a mandate to make our national Government more accountable and more responsible  to ensure that taxpayers get full value for their money and to pursue a clear  focused agenda that produces tangible results. The United Nations should accept nothing less. (spoke in English)  This Organization must become more accountable and more effective. Management reform must continue  and at an accelerated pace. The taxpayers of Member nations  Canadians among them  make significant financial contributions to this Organization. They have the right to expect stronger    23 06-52988  more independent oversight mechanisms  more robust accountability for how funds are spent  and human resources practices that are based on merit. (spoke in French)  I have just described the tests by which this Organization will be judged. Canada wants this to be a positive judgment. We were there when the United Nations was founded. Like the other countries  we were motivated by a pressing need to establish a new international consensus in a world devastated by war. And  like the others  we were motivated by our own pragmatic interests and noble aspirations for all of humanity. More than 60 years later the formula remains the same. (spoke in English)  The challenge has always been the same: to bring nations together to build a better world by forging consensus on common purposes and by finding the political will to translate these into action.  When these goals have been achieved  Canada has always been with the Organization — through the war against fascism  the cold war  dozens of United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping missions  and more recent multinational military engagements in the Balkans and the Persian Gulf.  Today Afghanistan leads the list of challenges that we face collectively — peacebuilding in a nation where there is not yet peace  where progress requires a wide range of capabilities undertaken by a wide array of our Member States.  My earnest hope is that we will say with pride to future generations of leaders: We  the United Nations  took up that responsibility in Afghanistan  rose to the challenge and met it firmly  collectively  successfully. In this endeavour  as with the others I have outlined  Canada will be there with the Organization at every step along the way. "
"31",1234,"CHE",61,2006,"We recently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Albert Einstein. He recommended the construction of the atomic bomb to President Roosevelt  yet always described himself as a militant pacifist. He shared his qualms of conscience with Sigmund Freud. In the course of their correspondence  the two men agreed in particular that  if all peoples were to live in peace on this planet  the world needed an international organization with which all people could identify. Empathy towards that organization could provide it with the authority to counter war. It was in that conviction and with the same emotion that the men and women of my country voted in favour of Switzerland’s accession to the United Nations almost five years ago.  Today  I affirm that we are glad to have taken that step.  Switzerland may not have experienced war within its own borders for a number of centuries  but that is not enough to satisfy us  for war is not only there where bombs fall  killing men  women and children. We are all involved in the conflicts that ravage our planet. So long as these wars continue  no one can talk convincingly of peace. We can overcome that feeling of powerlessness in the face of armed conflict by joining together to work towards peace. The country that I have the honour to represent is convinced that the United Nations is the most important means of pursuing that vision. The United Nations embodies our hopes for peace  solidarity and justice throughout the world.  Only through a common alliance of all nations do we have that opportunity. No country is capable of meeting the challenges of globalization alone. War  terrorism  drug trafficking  the offshoring of jobs and environmental and climate-related disasters are all global threats. They know no borders  not even those of powerful nations. No State  not even the strongest  is the master of its own fate. Only through an inclusive network with universally applicable norms can might and violence be replaced by justice. The United Nations has been the world’s most successful effort to achieve that end.  Every nation and every community is guided by its own historical and cultural experiences in dealing with conflicts. Nations behave and organize themselves accordingly. In Switzerland  our values are based on the three pillars of democracy  the rule of law and social equilibrium. That influences our view of how the international community could address conflicts worldwide by helping the victims of violence or disaster  establishing a legal system and enforcing it  and examining the deeper causes of violence and seeking to redress them.  The first reaction of a human being towards a suffering victim is to help that person. The United Nations has stood by victims of natural disasters with humanitarian assistance  be it after a tsunami or in a drought. It also assists people affected by war. In so doing  it has succeeded in building up positive empathy and in strengthening trust in it worldwide.  Should the United Nations fail in its humanitarian task  however  desperation and the tendency towards violence increase and intensify conflicts. That can be seen with brutal clarity in the Middle East and in Darfur.  Why should the international community not establish norms just like a State does? I refer here to the Millennium Development Goals  human rights  the climate change Protocol and international law. States have adopted penal codes to prosecute criminals  bring them before a court  sentence them and have their sentence enforced. Doing justice to victims prevents acts of vengeance and a never-ending spiral of further violence. It also serves as a deterrent to potential criminals.  What is good for a State should also be good for the international community. It must treat war criminals according to the same rules. The international community has to fight terrorism. There is no alternative to absolute respect for the rule of law  human rights and international law. The Geneva Conventions are no hindrance to that; on the contrary  if the appropriate instruments are lacking  new ones can be created  such as the convention on terrorism. Above all  however  we must not betray our principles and our values. Torture or any other illegal procedure has no place in our struggle and represents the radical negation of the rule of law. Recourse to such means strips the fight against terrorism of all its legitimacy.    06-52737 14   The establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was a key date in the history of humanity. It is in this Court that war criminals are tried  found guilty and sentenced. Unfortunately  the process can sometimes take a long time  as we have seen in the case of Liberia  and sometimes it can take far too much time  as in the case of the Balkans. War criminals must be extradited so that justice can be done. All war criminals  including those from the Darfur conflict  must be made aware of the consequences of their crimes and know that they will not go unpunished.  Respect for the law implies that all States  from the smallest to the largest  become parties to the ICC Statute. Public international law  while it is of fundamental importance for small countries which are unable to defend themselves on their own  also serves the interests of large States  and even super-Powers  if they do not want to find themselves accused of arbitrary acts of imperialism.  We all know that no State can function purely on the basis of laws and ordinances. Laws and ordinances must have the full support of the public. The same is true for the United Nations. That is why the Human Rights Council in Geneva will search for solutions through dialogue partnerships rather than by issuing threats. That will take time  a great deal of time. The existence of the Peacebuilding Commission at the United Nations clearly shows that the United Nations peacekeepers cannot bring about or enforce peace by themselves. There need to be blueprints for peace and expert evaluations  together with a long-term “variable-geometry” commitment on the part of the international community  in order to prevent conflicts.  Critics who believed that the United Nations was incapable of reform now have before them proof to the contrary. By establishing a Human Rights Council and a Peacebuilding Commission  the United Nations has demonstrated that it wanted to give new life to values such as the protection of human rights and that it could develop new peacekeeping instruments.  Just as a democracy strives to involve all its citizens in political decisions  regardless of their background or financial standing  the United Nations must not allow small groups of States or individual States to impose their law on others. A broad consensus must prevail. That is why we would like to see the reform and enlargement of the Security Council  which would undoubtedly strengthen its legitimacy. Given that we have still a long way to go before that point is reached  let us  rather  remain pragmatic and content ourselves with short-term improvements to the Council’s working methods  in particular  the right of veto.  Every State will try to find the underlying causes of threats to its cohesion and endeavour to overcome them  and so it is with a community of States.  Environmental disasters give rise to mass migration and legions of refugees. The signatories of the Kyoto Protocol want to cut off this evil at the root. But  here again  all States  without exception  must set for themselves the same goals as were set at Kyoto and  above all  take appropriate measures.  Every military conflict and every terrorist attack stems from economic inequalities and social injustices. That is why we must do our utmost to fight poverty  lack of future prospects and political impotence.  Religious conflicts are also born of economic and social inequalities. In reality  the East-West divide is perhaps more a North-South divide. If we want to promote religious tolerance  we must pay the price  which is greater social and economic justice. By adopting the Millennium Development Goals  the world has set itself the task of reducing extreme poverty by half by 2015. Let us give ourselves and the United Nations the means for keeping that promise.  It is through dialogue that it is possible to address the conflict in the Middle East  the stabilization of Iraq and the nuclear crisis with Iran  and all the parties concerned should do everything they can to avoid fanning the flames of discord. Respect for the basic principles of the Charter of the United Nations is just as essential. In other words  no State is entitled to deny the right of another to exist. Lastly  we cannot disappoint those who aspire to self-determination if they have the law on their side.  When there is a clash of cultures  the response must be dialogue between cultures and between religions. We have no other choice. Humiliation and lack of respect for other cultures undoubtedly serve as breeding grounds for terrorism. Since all States are represented here  the United Nations is a forum unlike any other. We are looking forward to the issuance of the report on the alliance of civilizations by the High-level Group appointed by the Secretary-General. Switzerland will be very active in this endeavour.   15 06-52737   Switzerland is a neutral country. Our neutrality has never authorized us to look upon the world with indifference or to stand on the sidelines. It has always meant that we have the obligation to work to establish peace. We have never wanted to be  and have never been  neutral towards victims of oppression and violence or the rules of the international community and of international law. The only legitimate ally of a neutral country is public international law. Neutrality means refusing all forms of hegemony and championing the peaceful coexistence of all countries  which all enjoy equal rights. That is how Switzerland understands neutrality and how it intends to exercise it here.  As I said at the outset  Albert Einstein concluded that the empathy that people would come to feel for community institutions could become the means to prevent war. But how is such empathy brought about? It develops thanks to people who  in word and deed  commit themselves in these institutions and thereby generate optimism about justice and peace.  Secretary-General Kofi Annan is one of these people. He has given the United Nations the face it has today  thank to his commitment in all areas of United Nations activity  sometimes in the most delicate of situations. We are greatly indebted to him  and we ask him to accept our very sincere thanks. Switzerland is particularly grateful for his personal involvement in support of our country’s joining the United Nations. And yes  I confirm once again today  we are glad that we took that step. "
"32",1280,"CHL",61,2006,"I come before the General Assembly as the first woman to be elected President of Chile  a country that has learned from its history.  We Chileans are living through difficult times; the Assembly knows this. The learning curve was difficult but productive. From pain hope was born. Major dissent gave way to major consensus. I come from a country where today the rule of law prevails  where the rights of persons are respected and promoted. It is a democracy that is experiencing economic growth  which in the past 16 years has helped millions of Chileans out of poverty. Chile stands with its region and looks at the world. My presence here today is a symbol of that Chile  a Chile that is unafraid to look back at the past and is united in building its own future. We can say with pride that today Chile is more free and more fair. As a society we have granted every citizen the basic dignity and respect that he or she deserves.  The world looks different from the far distant south  and that is the viewpoint my country wishes to bring here  a viewpoint that is optimistic about the opportunities of globalization but cautious about its risks. We can and must steer the course of the planet. Humans cannot and must not avoid being the instruments of their own advancement.  We wish to reaffirm our commitment to international law and institutions. Only through them shall we be able to build the fairer and more integrated world of which we dream  where large and small coexist in peace and harmony. The United Nations is a special instrument in this construction. A year ago we agreed on a programme for the reform of the Organization based on development  security and human rights. This has been called the millennium of hope. Let us make that hope a reality and do so from here  from this forum.    06-52879 6   Development is a responsibility shared by all members of the international community  including the developed countries. Its attainment requires imagination and the political will to consolidate the world alliance endorsed by the Millennium Declaration. All this presupposes a more open  transparent and fair commercial and financial system. To our developed friends I say “Opening your markets to products from the south is a requirement of justice.” That will represent a huge step forward towards the elimination of poverty. Let us therefore redouble our efforts to bring the Doha Round to a successful conclusion and make progress in integration processes at the regional level.  As an early supporter of the idea of President Lula of Brazil  Chile joined other countries in the initiative Action against Hunger and Poverty. We have introduced a solidarity tax of $2 on international airline tickets  and the funds produced will finance the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) project  which will provide millions of quality drugs to people in developing countries suffering from malaria  tuberculosis and AIDS.  The most serious failure of the 2005 Summit was its silence on the multilateral disarmament agenda. Chile bases its multilateral foreign policy on the principle that collective security is indivisible. We all share a responsibility to preserve peace and international security. That is why Chile has joined in efforts to revitalize the disarmament agenda and move towards prohibition of the use of fissile material for military purposes.  The security of States is linked to the security of the human beings that make up those States  because it allows the exercise of freedom. Terrorism negates these freedoms and runs counter to the values that we share. Accordingly  we support the advance of United Nations reform in the area of counter-terrorism. Terrorism must be combated within democracy. Whenever we restrict constitutional guarantees and yield to the temptation to employ illegal methods to fight terrorism we are handing a victory to its proponents  because it is only then that they succeed in threatening the spirit of our democracy.  In a spirit of solidarity we are participating actively in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Chile will continue to support the Haitian people  and I appeal from this rostrum to all donor countries to provide the economic and financial assistance already pledged.  The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission was undoubtedly one of the most outstanding achievements of the 2005 Summit. Chile has joined enthusiastically in the work of the Commission and will endeavour to ensure that its results live up to the hopes placed in it by nations.  My country deplores the serious crisis affecting the Middle East and strongly condemns any armed action targeting innocent civilians. Self-defence may be exercised only within the framework of proportionality and containment outlined in international humanitarian law. The delay in the Security Council’s call for a ceasefire in Lebanon was also inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Charter. The credibility of the Organization requires that all stakeholders do their duty without discrimination and without subordinating collective security to their individual interests.  Chile supports the deployment of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with its expanded mandate  and will continue to respond to the appeal to meet urgent humanitarian needs in Lebanon and Palestine. We urge full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  which calls on the international community to cooperate in a full cessation of hostilities in the Middle East  the restoration of Lebanon’s sovereignty over its territory and the guaranteeing of Israel’s security.  The promotion and defence of human rights and democracy is the cornerstone of Chile’s foreign policy. As I said at the outset  we have learned a great deal from our own history. Exactly 30 years ago the General Assembly received terrible news: Orlando Letelier  the former Foreign Minister and Defence Minister of President Allende  had been brutally murdered on the street in Washington D.C. Representatives were horrified by that crime and today I remember with emotion how we felt. I mention that to illustrate how we have learned the lessons of the past. Nothing justifies the violation of human rights. Chile rejects impunity.  I assure all members of our commitment and enthusiasm to participate in initiatives designed to promote human rights and democracy. We therefore welcome the launching of the United Nations Democracy Fund and the creation of the Human Rights   7 06-52879  Council. We very much value the Council’s adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  The promotion of human rights does not contradict the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States. Chile has been  and will remain  in the front line in the defence of human rights.  The General Assembly must continue United Nations reform. It must revitalize itself  reform and expand the Security Council  reform the Economic and Social Council and modernize the management of the Secretariat and the administrative procedures of the Organization.  Allow me to reaffirm our hope in the United Nations. As a woman  a doctor and the political leader of a developing country  today I ask that we choose life  affirm justice  promote social justice and make this noble Organization the common and continuing response to our peoples’ dreams of peace  development and dignity.

"33",1326,"CHN",61,2006,"I wish to begin by congratulating you  Madam President  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am confident that  under your guidance  this session will achieve full success. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the last session  and to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Republic of Montenegro on becoming a Member of the United Nations.  The world is experiencing profound and complex changes. Peace  development and cooperation have become trends of our times and represent the common aspirations of all countries and peoples in the world. However  the world is not tranquil and the issue of development remains prominent. There is still a long way to go in the pursuit of durable peace and common development. Recently  the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula  the Iranian nuclear issue and the Lebanese-Israeli conflict have flared up  adversely affecting regional and global stability and testing the wisdom  unity and patience of the international community.    06-53317 22   To maintain peace is the shared mission of the entire international community. Consultations based on equality and peaceful negotiations are the only effective means to resolve disputes. China  as a permanent member of the Security Council and a member of the international community  will continue to make every effort to achieve a peaceful resolution of hotspot issues.  As regards the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula  China is committed to maintaining peace and stability on the Peninsula  making it free of nuclear weapons and promoting the six-party talks. During the Security Council’s deliberations in July regarding the missile tests by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the related resolution  China made strenuous efforts to engage the parties concerned  in an effort to maintain peace on the Peninsula and in North-East Asia and preserve the unity and authority of the Security Council and safeguard the progress already made in the six-party talks.  Long-standing antagonism and mistrust between the parties concerned is the main cause of the current difficulty. All parties should be patient and pragmatic and act with vision to reduce differences and remove obstacles through dialogue. The six-party talks remain an effective mechanism to enhance understanding and trust and resolve the Korean nuclear issue. We hope that the parties involved will be cool-headed and more flexible  expand common ground  meet each other halfway and work together for the early resumption of the six-party talks and progressive implementation of the joint statement. That is the only viable solution to the Korean nuclear issue.  With respect to the Iranian nuclear issue  China calls for upholding the integrity of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime  and is opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It has worked for a peaceful resolution of the issue in order to promote peace and stability in the Middle East. At the same time  the legitimate right of countries to the peaceful use of nuclear energy should be fully respected  provided they fulfil their relevant international obligations.  Diplomatic negotiation represents the best chance to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue and serve the interests of all parties. China hopes that the parties involved will exercise patience and restraint  continue to take a flexible approach and remain committed to the right course of pursuing a peaceful resolution. China will continue to play a constructive role in working for an appropriate settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue.  As regards the Lebanese-Israeli conflict  China opposes any move that will undermine peace and stability in the region  and calls for a comprehensive cessation of hostilities. China welcomes Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and hopes that it will be strictly observed. China hopes that the parties concerned will reach an early agreement on a framework of political settlement that is both just and durable.  The question of Palestine is at the core of the Middle East issue. The peace process should be re-started in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the principle of land for peace  in the interest of reaching an early and comprehensive settlement of the Middle East issue  including the Palestinian-Israeli conflict  so that the countries involved can live in harmony and the region can enjoy durable peace.  The United Nations has played an instrumental role in resolving regional flashpoints this year. But the Organization also faces major challenges. In the new international environment  to enhance its role through reform is in the common interest of humankind. The United Nations needs to take resolute steps in carrying out reform. The United Nations should develop in a way that promotes the purposes and principles of its Charter  upholds the unity and cooperation of the Organization and serves the collective interests of its Members. The reform of the United Nations should be comprehensive in coverage  and progress should be made in security  development  human rights and other fields. More should be done to promote development and facilitate the realization of the Millennium Development Goals. The reform of the Organization should  as far as possible  satisfy the needs of its Member States  particularly those from the developing world. The reform should be a democratic process and full consultations should be conducted to reach widespread consensus. Major controversial issues should be handled with caution and dealt with through in-depth consultations.  China welcomes the progress made in reforming the United Nations  in particular the progress in implementing the World Summit Outcome. We will   23 06-53317  pledge $3 million to the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund. We will continue to work with other countries to make progress in the reform of the United Nations  strengthen the unity and authority of the Organization and increase its efficiency and capacity to respond to challenges.  As the chief administrator of the United Nations  the Secretary-General has an important role to play. In the election of the next Secretary-General  China will firmly support an Asian candidate. We are convinced that Asia can produce a competent and well-respected Secretary-General acceptable to all Member States.  The scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations involves the interests of all Member States and constitutes the financial foundation of the Organization. All Member States have an obligation to pay their assessments on time and in full. The ability to pay is the basic principle governing the scale of assessments. It should be adhered to  as it has proved effective and represents the general consensus of Member States. Over the years  China has honoured its financial obligations in good faith and has made appropriate contributions to the budget of the United Nations. As China’s economy grows  we are prepared to increase our contributions to the Organization’s budget in accordance with the principle of ability to pay. We are ready to take part in relevant discussions in a constructive way  and hope that a fair and equitable formula will be reached on the basis of extensive consultations.  Without overall development  global peace and progress cannot be sustained. In addition to developing the concept of partnership and improving its modalities  all countries should honour our commitment to the global partnership for development set out in the Millennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and last year’s World Summit Outcome.   Countries should shoulder the primary responsibility for their own development and implement comprehensive development strategies in keeping with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  The international community — and developed countries in particular — should increase development assistance  promote international trade  technology transfers and investment  offer more extensive debt relief  provide more support to developing countries and respect their ownership of national development strategies.  The United Nations should play a bigger role in the field of development. It should create a fair and equitable framework to assess progress in meeting the MDGs and ensure that the United Nations Foundation and the various United Nations programmes and specialized agencies provide greater support for capacity-building programmes in developing countries. It should enhance coordination between international development policy and monetary  financial and trading regimes and create an enabling international environment for developing countries.  The suspension of the Doha round serves nobody’s interests. Members of the World Trade Organization should demonstrate political will  speedily resume the Doha development round and work towards a comprehensive and balanced outcome.  Non-governmental organizations should be encouraged to be more extensively and deeply involved in development cooperation. Their efforts and those of Governments should complement each other.  The establishment of the Human Rights Council echoes the calling of our times. Member States have a common responsibility to make the Council a dynamic and effective body. The Council should give greater attention to massive and gross violations of human rights caused by armed conflicts and should support the international community in its efforts to prevent conflicts  restore peace and combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  The Council should attach equal importance to economic  social and cultural rights and encourage the international community and United Nations agencies to take effective measures to support countries in their efforts to realize their right to development.   The Council should continue to give special attention to the rights of women  children  persons with disabilities  migrant workers  ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups to ensure that they enjoy the same level of respect as others.  The Council should promote dialogue and cooperation on an equal footing between countries of different social systems and levels of development  address human rights issues properly and reject double standards and politicization.    06-53317 24   For decades  relations between China and African countries have been characterized by sincerity and mutual support. We have conducted our cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit  while safeguarding sovereignty and independence and promoting social and economic development in our respective countries. All that has served to bring about significant benefits for the Chinese and African peoples alike.  China and Africa will hold a summit and the third ministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in Beijing from 3 to 5 November. Focusing on the theme of friendship  peace  cooperation and development  Chinese and African leaders will discuss ways to establish and foster a new type of strategic partnership featuring political equality and mutual trust  win-win economic cooperation and cultural exchanges. They will also draft a blueprint to enhance China-Africa cooperation. China is committed to peaceful development. Africa  which is home to the largest number of developing countries  is committed to achieving stability and renewal. Stronger ties between China and Africa will contribute to South-South cooperation and international peace and development.  The conduct of China’s diplomacy aims to safeguard world peace and promote common development. China is committed to developing itself through safeguarding and promoting world peace through its own development. We are pursuing development that is peaceful  inclusive  cooperative and harmonious in nature. We will endeavour to promote the fundamental interests of our own people in harmony with the common interests of other peoples and to pursue peace  promote development and resolve disputes through cooperation.  China is dedicated to building a harmonious world. It hopes to increase mutual respect and understanding with other countries and to live in harmony with them. China respects the right of a country to choose its own path to development. It supports equal participation by different countries in international affairs and democracy in international relations. It works to enhance mutual benefits  win-win outcomes and global prosperity through sharing the benefits of economic globalization and technological progress. China seeks to promote a diversified world and advance human civilization by furthering dialogue  understanding and mutual enrichment between different cultures. China is committed to advancing human progress by enhancing dialogue  building mutual trust with other countries and working with them to address global issues.  China will continue to demonstrate to the world that it is an important force for global peace and development and that the Chinese people will remain trustworthy friends and cooperation partners to the world’s peoples.

"34",1360,"CIV",61,2006,"First  Madam  I should like to congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your election is proof of the high esteem in which the international community holds your country  Bahrain  and also yourself  whose wealth of diplomatic experience will help us find the right solutions to the problems facing this session of the Assembly. I would also ask you kindly to convey my delegation’s congratulations to the other members of the Bureau. You may count on my delegation’s    06-53952 12  unremitting willingness and desire to work with you for the success of this session. Allow me also to express to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  the Ivorian delegation’s gratitude for his intensive activities during his presidency and for the quality of the work he accomplished.  I would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and to reiterate my country’s appreciation for the skill with which he has discharged his mission at the head of our Organization. As he prepares to leave his office  I would like to say how proud my country  a neighbour of Ghana  his motherland  is for the distinguished way he has guided the United Nations over the past 10 years. I would like to express to him once again the sincere gratitude of the people and the Government of Côte d’Ivoire for his personal commitment to advancing the process of peace and reconciliation in Côte d’Ivoire.  We welcome the Republic of Montenegro  which has just joined the great family of the United Nations; I pledge Côte d’Ivoire’s readiness to cooperate with it.  As the General Assembly marked the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations  we all expressed our ambition to reform the Organization. We raised the bar very high for our objectives in the main areas of United Nations activity  namely international peace and security  development and human rights. We decided  among other things  to create a new mechanism to restore and consolidate peace in countries devastated by conflict and war  to adopt strategies to combat poverty and disease and to act collectively to prevent genocide and promote human rights. At the sixtieth session  which recently came to an end  we were able to achieve significant progress while seeking to overcome existing differences.  Further tangible progress has been made since then in many areas  such as counter-terrorism  human rights  democracy  peacekeeping  humanitarian intervention and management reform in order to make the Secretariat more effective and accountable.  With regard to the strengthening of the human rights machinery  for example  I should like to welcome our joint commitment to help the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to strengthen its services and to double its working budget. The creation of the Human Rights Council  which began its work in Geneva on 19 June 2006  to replace the Commission on Human Rights is another sign of our common awareness that we need to set the question of the respect and promotion of human rights among our priorities. We now have a Human Rights Council  which must work with determination and a sense of responsibility  so as to regain respect and obtain the results expected by all.  As for terrorism  on whose definition everyone has yet to agree  my delegation welcomes the existence within our Organization of a structure to coordinate the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations  committed by whomever  wherever and for whatever purposes.  Another source of satisfaction is the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission  which is aimed at giving assistance to countries emerging from armed conflict. In this respect  and in the context of creating the solidarity that should exist within our Organization  the United Nations and the international community must continue their efforts to bring lasting peace in post-conflict periods in countries emerging from war. They must be involved financially in this process not only to consolidate this peace but also and above all to contribute to the economic recovery and sustainable development of those countries.  In his important — and final — report on the work of the Organization (A/61/1)  introduced to the Assembly on 19 September 2006 (see )  Secretary-General Kofi Annan advocates a United Nations that is able to find solutions in this divided world so that people can fulfil their common destiny. In explaining his thinking  he said that we now face a world whose divisions threaten the very notion of an international community whereas most of the challenges require a global response. My delegation fully shares this affirmation of the Secretary-General. Finding a global  indeed comprehensive  response to all the world’s problems in all areas  particularly those of international peace and security  sustainable development and fundamental human rights  are the real objectives of this Organization.  More than half a century after the creation of our Organization  increasingly serious and complex problems continue to arise in the world. We have seen serious violations of international law and a repeated use of force at the expense of dialogue. We can add to this poverty  illiteracy  hunger  pandemics  local conflicts and terrorism  not forgetting natural disasters. In addition to these challenges  increasing   13 06-53952  globalization imposes demands and responsibilities that are increasingly burdensome for the international community. We are living in a world where the media can come into our homes and make us more aware of the suffering of others. This forces the world’s decision-makers to display more justice and equity.   The events of the past few years — particularly the most recent events in the Middle East — seem once again to call into question the commitment set out in the Millennium Declaration to share responsibilities  in the context of the multilateralism represented by the United Nations  in order to address the threats to international peace and security. Those events seem to have caused deep divisions within the international community and have raised new questions about the effectiveness of United Nations action and the principles that guided its establishment.  It is thus urgent that the General Assembly begin to have in-depth discussions about the future of multilateralism. Indeed  my delegation believes that the concept of multilateralism should reflect a broad consensus regarding the means to prevent major threats to international peace and security and responses that must be made to those threats.   The legitimacy of the United Nations is the Organization’s main asset. Therefore  that legitimacy must be reinforced by the confidence of States and of international public opinion in the capacity of the United Nations to resolve international problems through agreed action.   There are positive examples in this area illustrating that assertion. Indeed  following the attacks of 11 September 2001  the United Nations demonstrated that it could act swiftly by establishing a collective mechanism to combat terrorism. In the area of peacekeeping and peacebuilding  we have also seen that the Organization could carry out complex mandates and tackle the difficult task of stabilizing a conflict situation and assisting countries in transition towards peace and democracy. Pertinent examples can be cited in that regard: Timor-Leste at the time of its independence  Kosovo  Sierra Leone and Liberia.   Those examples demonstrate that authorization to deploy multinational forces is proving to be the appropriate tool for calming down — if not extinguishing — hotbeds of tension. In that connection  my delegation is grateful to the countries and organizations that have headed such forces. We remain aware of their acts of solidarity  and we welcome their interest in maintaining peace throughout the world.  With regard to weapons of mass destruction and small arms and light weapons  Côte d’Ivoire agrees that there is a need to strengthen and complete existing international legislation. I believe that the United Nations must broaden its action in this area and adopt the measures necessary to prevent the proliferation of these weapons. It must also take unequivocal measures spelling out the consequences for any State that does not respect such legislation.  Another new challenge with global consequences threatens our existence: the phenomenon of terrorism. Indeed  no one is safe from terrorist attacks. As stressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the work of the Organization during the fifty-eighth session (A/58/1)  terrorism continues to pose a major threat to international peace and security. It must thus be combated everywhere and tirelessly. While universal condemnation of terrorism must remain strong and unwavering  the fight against it must be carried out within the framework of strict respect for human rights  fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.   Returning to the subject of conflict prevention  my delegation would like to commend the work begun by the United Nations through its adoption of resolution 57/337  which is aimed at integrating that issue into its areas of action and invites States and regions to adopt conflict prevention strategies. Specific activities to establish a structural culture of conflict prevention at the national  regional and international levels must be carried out and strengthened.  Moreover  my delegation believes that additional resources should be devoted to conflict prevention programmes and projects. A mechanism for strengthening international cooperation in this area should be established in countries at risk. Indeed  history teaches us that disagreements — even seemingly insignificant ones — can lead to difficult-to-manage conflicts if they are not contained in time. Thus  it is important that the Organization’s interventions be preventive in order to avoid the dramatic and tragic consequences of such conflicts. That is in the interests of everyone  and in the interest of the Organization’s credibility.  Henceforth  it should be a major United Nations priority to establish a policy of conflict prevention by    06-53952 14  strengthening international dialogue and creating appropriate mechanisms for conflict settlement. Constant monitoring of international commitments should be a part of this new vision of peaceful coexistence and international harmony.  Côte d’Ivoire has always supported the Secretary-General’s United Nations reform programme. We welcome the major progress already made with a view to making the Organization more active and more effective. The resolve shown by the Secretary-General in that regard must also be demonstrated by all Member States.  The current composition of the Security Council  in both quantitative and qualitative terms  remains a prisoner of the past and does not reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. Developing countries — and Africa in particular — have not yet found their place on the Council. Therefore  so long as this issue remains unresolved  the Council’s decisions will continue to be perceived as reflecting mainly the interests of the countries benefiting from its current composition. Member States — particularly the Council’s five permanent members — must display a spirit of initiative and openness with regard to this issue  which has been on the United Nations agenda for more than a decade.  The comprehensive implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains a fundamental United Nations priority. My delegation is particularly concerned by the current trends  which indicate that many developing countries are falling behind and that  at the current rate  those countries will not be able to attain the Goals without assistance.   Accomplishing the MDGs requires partnership and cooperation among all the countries of the world. In that connection  my delegation would like to urge the international community to provide the necessary support to developing countries  particularly the least developed and most heavily indebted countries. A sufficient amount of official development assistance and foreign direct investment would likely enable such countries to take their place in the process of socio-economic development.  Therefore  my delegation would like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his efforts to undertake reforms to make our institution fully address the important task of achieving the MDGs. The socio-economic survival of developing countries is at stake. My delegation thus encourages the United Nations system to continue to support the Governments of these States in their resolve to integrate the Goals into national and regional development programmes and strategies. In Africa  for example  the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) would be an ideal framework for the achievement of these goals. This is why NEPAD should be implemented and why our development partners’ promises should be fulfilled within the agreed deadline.   Côte d’Ivoire also welcomes the determined commitment of the Secretary-General to place the Organization at the service of its Members. Reforms now under way could very much help to place the Organization in the forefront of the fight to eliminate poverty and eradicate HIV/AIDS  malaria  tuberculosis and many other pandemics. This is why my delegation welcomes the launching of the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) on 19 September 2006  here during the current Assembly and in the presence of the Secretary-General. This initiative by France  which has been supported by other countries  such as Brazil  Chile  the United Kingdom and Norway  will give the poorest people access to drugs of known quality  including generic drugs  at the lowest prices and also to the means of diagnosing AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria. I am delighted that my country  Côte d’Ivoire  was one of the first four to establish a tax on air tickets to help finance the abovementioned fund.   At this stage in my statement  allow me to briefly mention the socio-political situation in my country  Côte d’Ivoire. Indeed  since the formation of the Government of Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny on 28 December 2005  following the adoption of Security Council resolution 1633 (2005) on 21 October 2005  the peace and reconciliation process in Côte d’Ivoire has seen — thanks to the actions of the Government  the main parties involved in the conflict and the Ivorian people as a whole — brought tangible progress in the implementation of the Government’s road map.  While significant progress has been achieved  much still remains to be done. In this respect  my delegation welcomes the invaluable assistance that the United Nations  the African Union  the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the European Union and friendly countries have all given to Côte d’Ivoire. My delegation invites them all to continue to give their support to the Government and   15 06-53952  people of Côte d’Ivoire in their search for a definitive way out of this crisis  which is unprecedented in the history of my country.   The future of the West African region and beyond — that of Africa as a whole — is at stake. We remain fully confident both in the United Nations and in the international community.   The legitimacy and credibility of our Organization  now sixty-one years old  remains intact  and its actions for the advancement of well-being and for better living standards on this planet all continue to be irreplaceable. The new challenges that the Organization faces  with the help of a multilateral perspective and a sense of an increased and clearly understood collective responsibility  should strengthen its effectiveness. Essential reforms  which it should embark upon in order to adapt to the new context of international relations  should enable it to respond more swiftly and effectively to the legitimate aspirations of its constituent peoples  who continue to have complete trust in it.   In sum  the United Nations remains useful  even today. It could be even stronger tomorrow  if we wish it.  "
"35",1403,"CMR",61,2006,"I should like  on behalf of my delegation  to say how delighted we are to see you  Madam  the representative of the Kingdom of Bahrain  a friendly country  presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I would like to assure you of our sincere wishes for your success. You can rest assured that my delegation will fully cooperate with you.  I would also like to pay tribute to the Kingdom of Sweden  a friendly country whose Minister for Foreign Affairs  Mr. Jan Eliasson  presided over the General Assembly at its sixtieth session in such an outstanding manner. Major progress was made during that session.  Finally  I should like to extend to Montenegro a warm welcome to the family of the peoples of the United Nations.  This session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world is once again facing major challenges. I am thinking in particular of the upsurge of terrorism  which threatens the security of States and our collective security. I am also thinking of the persistence of underdevelopment and the almost endemic poverty in the countries of the South. I am thinking  too  of pandemics of all kinds  including HIV/AIDS. Finally  I am thinking of cross-border organized crime.  Our world and our Organization need more generosity  more solidarity  more ethical behaviour and more tolerance  but also more courage and more imagination to tackle these challenges  which require a global approach in the multilateral context in which the United Nations is the forum par excellence.    06-53958 18   Opinions are being expressed in various quarters deploring the inability of the Organization to respond adequately to the fundamental aspirations of the world’s people  while some also believe that the Organization has become obsolete. Cameroon would like to reaffirm that it believes that  despite the inevitable shortcomings inherent in an organization of such size  the United Nations is today  more than ever before  the only institution that can bring about consensus in an effort to ease tension and find solutions. Very simply put  there is no substitute for the United Nations in managing in a coherent manner the problems to which I have referred.  In that regard  I would like to pay special tribute to the work of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I also wish to convey to him the gratitude of my country and my personal regard and appreciation for his efforts. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors  he has reinvigorated multilateralism in an especially difficult international environment. Cameroon is proud to have contributed to the election of this noble son of Africa following its assumption of the chairmanship of the Organization of Africa Unity. Today  while peace to many seems to be but a myth  Africa is truly honoured that Mr. Kofi Annan has taken his place among the world’s great peacemakers. In that regard  the Noble Peace Prize awarded to him was richly deserved.  In an international environment characterized by difficulties in ensuring that the rule of law prevails over the use of force  the Secretary-General was courageously able to promote the voice of reason. In an environment of heated passions  he succeeded in delivering a message of peace and brotherhood. Allow me  by way example in that regard  to refer to his unequivocal commitment to Cameroon and Nigeria — two brotherly countries linked by history and geography — in the peaceful and consensual implementation of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling of 10 October 2002 finally resolving the border dispute between our two countries.  The Greentree Agreement of 12 June 2006  implemented following the withdrawal of all Nigerian troops on 14 August 2006  is a credit both to the United Nations and the personal commitment of the Secretary-General. I would like to take this opportunity to thank friendly countries  including the Federal Republic of Germany  the United States of America  France and the United Kingdom. Along with the United Nations  those countries agreed to provide their moral and political support to the Greentree Agreement  which defined the modalities for the implementation of the ICJ ruling of 10 October 2002 on the Bakassi Peninsula. More importantly  they agreed to help us to implement it.   I would also like to reaffirm here and now Cameroon’s solemn commitment to continue to fulfil in good faith all its obligations emanating from the International Court of Justice decision and the Greentree Agreement. In particular  I would like to affirm that Nigerian nationals living in Bakassi desiring to remain there will be treated in the same way as the 4.5 million Nigerians living in Cameroon  who are able to live their lives in peace and harmony with Cameroonians.  That process has taught us that true lasting peace can never be imposed; it can only be established through patience and a spirit of compromise. In short  real lasting peace can only come from genuine joint political will.  Allow me to highlight some of the many initiatives undertaken by the United Nations that reflect the geopolitical developments under way and the aspirations of people around the world. In that regard  I would specifically like to refer to the Millennium Declaration  which is a genuine charter of international solidarity binding on all of us as an urgent obligation. In addition  the Organization’s ongoing attention to Africa is prominently reflected in the Secretary-General’s report on sustainable development and the causes of conflict in Africa  a document that will be an ongoing source of encouragement to our countries.   I also wish to recall that the Secretary-General laid the foundations for the reform of the Organization  which was made necessary in the light of the changes that have taken place in the world’s balance of power since the founding of United Nations. I should therefore now like to say a few words about what has come to be known as United Nations reform.  The Organization stands no chance of maintaining its place in world affairs unless it safeguards its legitimacy. In other words  it must ensure that its representative character is beyond reproach. The reform we seek should therefore take into account the development of the international system in the course of recent decades. Likewise  it will no doubt be necessary to modify the role played by some organs of the United Nations system. In that   19 06-53958  connection  I am thinking in particular of the role of the International Court of Justice. It is in everyone’s interest that the reform be properly carried out while taking into account today’s realities. But however reform is carried out  I believe that Africa should have permanent representation in the Security Council. That is not just a matter of justice  but also one of common sense.   In order to retain its credibility  the Organization should resolutely continue to pursue its efforts with regard to major issues related to peace and development in the developing world. On the political level  special attention should be paid to the Middle East  Darfur and the issue of nuclear proliferation. With regard to development  the Millennium Development Goals should be attained within a reasonable time frame.   In order to avert doubts as to the positive aspects of trade globalization  the United Nations likewise has a responsibility to maintain a balance between the countries of the North and the South in such major trade negotiations as the now-suspended Doha Round. Failure in that regard would have disastrous consequences for Africa.   Finally  our Organization must continue to safeguard the cultural identity of the various peoples of the world and to promote a dialogue among cultures and religions. The sharing of experiences and the knowledge gained through such an honest and respectful dialogue will be the best antidote to the clash of civilizations that some predict as well as a sure alternative to terrorism and violence.  Over the years  the United Nations has become a crucial stakeholder in the international arena. I believe we should all welcome that development because  first of all  this parliament of nations is the only forum in which virtually all peoples are represented and where a blueprint for international democracy is gradually being drafted. We should welcome it also because — and this is an important point — the systematic consideration by our Organization of crises or tensions gives negotiation a chance and makes the use of force less likely. True  it has not just been success stories  but I think that  broadly speaking  the balance sheet is quite positive. This should prompt us not to begrudge the United Nations our trust and to give it means commensurate with its ambitions  its responsibilities and the expectations we have of it.   For its part  Cameroon will continue to support all the initiatives of our Organization aimed at maintaining peace and solidarity among peoples. I need hardly say that the human person must remain paramount among our concerns. This  inter alia  will be the task facing the new Human Rights Council  of which my country is honoured to be a member.  Our Organization cannot remain indifferent to the tragedy of the massive migration flows that we have been witnessing for some time. Clearly this situation poses a challenge not only to our States but also to the entire international community  and we must all work together to strengthen cooperation in this area between the countries of the North and the countries of the South.  I believe that  appearances to the contrary — and although many hotbeds of tension and threat still remain — the international community seems to be moving towards greater stability. Credit  to a large extent  goes to the work done by the United Nations  its various organs and its staff  who are carrying out their responsibilities in conditions that are often difficult  even dangerous.  That is the substance of the message of Mr. Paul Biya  President of the Republic of Cameroon  to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. "
"36",1447,"COD",61,2006,"At the outset  Sir  I would ask you to kindly convey to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa my warm and heartfelt congratulations upon her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. My congratulations go also to all the other members of the Bureau who  I am certain  will help her to successfully accomplish her illustrious and sensitive delicate tasks as President. I also take the opportunity to pay due tribute to her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  for the high quality of his work during a term of office that took place in a difficult international environment.  I cannot continue without expressing my gratitude  and that of the entire Congolese people  to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  whose mandate will come to an end this year on a positive note for all. Thanks to the remarkable leadership of that worthy son of Africa  the States Members of our Organization have enjoyed a decade of intense and active diplomacy which has made it possible to solve a large number of conflicts throughout the world. Here  I should mention especially the situation of the countries of the Great Lakes region  in particular that of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   As the sixty-first session of the General Assembly is taking place  my country  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  is passing through a special period of its political history. The transition period that began in 1990 will soon draw to a close  with the establishment of the country’s new institutions.   On 30 July  we held countrywide  in a climate of peace and transparency  the first truly democratic pluralistic elections in 40 years. The success of that undertaking constitutes a great joint effort by the Congolese people and by the bilateral and multilateral partners of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those partners.  With regard to the unfortunate events in Kinshasa from 20 to 22 August 2006 following the announcement of the provisional results of the first round of the presidential elections by the Independent Electoral Commission  all necessary steps have been taken in order to prevent such incidents from happening again. The electoral process will continue in a climate of national peace and harmony.  The progress achieved daily  sometimes at the cost of much sacrifice  is the outcome of a difficult political process that was launched  as members know  after a long internal and external armed conflict. The humanitarian consequences of that conflict are one of the worst tragedies ever experienced by mankind.    06-52885 30  Problems remain in many sectors  and the next Government will have to confront them  taking account of the urgent and legitimate expectations of the Congolese people.  The new Government must continue integrating and reforming the army  in order to guarantee peace and security for our people. It must work to improve the living conditions of the population. In other words  it must do its utmost to meet their fundamental needs  in particular health care  education  food security  basic infrastructures  electricity and drinking water for all — without forgetting  of course  the fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS and the fight against poverty.   In order to succeed  the new Government must  inter alia  strengthen good governance by fighting corruption and guaranteeing legal and judiciary security in the framework of ongoing judicial reform. It will be possible to achieve that vision only by mobilizing the energy of our entire nation through active and inclusive participation by all of the sons and daughters of our country  whatever their political  ideological or religious convictions may be.  In that regard  we welcome the configuration of our future parliament  which already reflects the wealth and political diversity of our people  and which has an oversight role that will be fundamental to the functioning of the State. For that reason  I reaffirm my faith in the concept of peacebuilding and make an urgent appeal to the international community to continue its partnerships with the Democratic Republic of the Congo after the establishment of the new institutions.  As we observe the international scene  we see recurring scourges  including continuing tensions and armed conflicts in several regions of the world  the worsening the living conditions in developing countries  especially in Africa; the rise in clandestine immigration; the destruction caused by different pandemics; the increase in crime and acts of terrorism; and the harm to the conservation and protection of the environment. In view of these threats  the Assembly at its previous session had organized  as part of its work  the World Summit of heads of State and Government  dedicated to an assessment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other commitments resulting from the major international conferences and meetings.   Following that assessment several decisions were taken  including the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council — two basic structures whose effective establishment we can only welcome. Achieving the MDGs is a priority for a good number of countries  especially the most disadvantaged. That is why the momentum in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Millennium Summit should not weaken. We would like to see our discussions here include those issues.   In addition to the above-mentioned scourges  other matters are a source of concern for our country  including the reform of the Security Council  the complete cancellation of the debt of developing countries  an increase in official development assistance  the adoption of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism and the global strategy to fight that phenomenon  armed conflicts  collective security  and the adoption of an international treaty on forced disappearances. All those issues challenge the harmonious progress of the community of nations and the very future of coming generations.   To meet those challenges effectively  all countries of the world must show solidarity with each other  in a spirit of sincere cooperation and humanist justice. With regard to crises in the world — in the Middle East  in Africa or elsewhere — the Democratic Republic of the Congo recommends  more than ever  their peaceful solution under the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.   I hope this Assembly shares my belief in the rebirth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the advent of new institutions seeking to usher in a new era of peace  stability and development  not only in my country  but also in Central Africa and the entire region of the Great Lakes. Despite the challenges our Organization faces day after day  it is on a note of hope  of solidarity among nations and of synergy in their actions for a brighter future for present and future generations that I conclude my statement. I hope for much success in our work.  "
"37",1494,"COG",61,2006,"Madam  your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session is the sign of a favourable turn of events in the world. I congratulate you and I welcome you not only as an experienced diplomat  with established skills and qualifications  but also as a great advocate of human rights. I wish also to commend  through you  your country  the State of Bahrain  for its tremendous contribution to the promotion of the values of peace  freedom and equality.  I should like also to express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Jan Eliasson for the wisdom and competence with which he guided the previous session. He deserves plaudits for having led to a successful outcome the difficult negotiations on the establishment of the Human Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding Commission. I would also like to congratulate a great son of Africa  a friend and brother  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his work as Secretary-General. His outstanding work was recognized at the seventh session of the Conference of the African Union held last July at Banjul and was given a moving and memorable tribute that I would like to reiterate here. Mr. Secretary-General  the world is grateful to you; Africa is proud of you. Furthermore  I would like to welcome Montenegro as a Member State  whose admission reinforces the universal character of our Organization. We wish that country a warm welcome.  This session opens at a time when the overall situation in the world is becoming more and more complex with reasons for concern and reasons for hope. It is our responsibility to ensure through multilateralism that hope overcomes fear and that the world becomes safer for future generations. We must reaffirm our faith in multilateralism  because the many challenges of our time must be confronted collectively; no State can deal with them alone. The same is true for the environment  terrorism  drug trafficking etc. Since its creation  the United Nations has never slackened in the search for ways and means to assume its responsibilities.  But today more than ever  it is necessary to encourage the search for collective solutions for the many sorts of phenomena that weaken global peace. Today more than ever  we must join our energies to build a world in which human beings can live where    06-52737 2  they wish in dignity  safe from need and fear. That is the purpose of our joint activities.  In order to eradicate armed violence  we must work for peace through the prevention and settlement of conflicts. The situation in the Middle East continues to be a serious threat to international peace and security. It is urgent that a just  lasting and comprehensive solution be found to this conflict that is ravaging this region. We need a solution based on the agreed proposals  such as the Road Map and the relevant resolutions of our Organization. The role of the Quartet in this respect is crucial. The cessation of hostilities  after one month of pointless violence in Lebanon  must be consolidated in order to achieve a lasting ceasefire.  As for Africa  positive advances have been made in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with the holding of general elections. Every effort must be made to ensure the successful conclusion of the electoral process  namely the second round of the presidential elections. The fact that we are now speaking of peacebuilding in Burundi  Liberia and Sierra Leone is not only a reason for satisfaction but also a reason for hope for other countries still in a state of conflict. At the same time  in many other situations  such as those in Côte d’Ivoire  the Sudan or in Somalia  the search for the way to solve those conflicts is still on the agenda. We wish to develop a natural partnership between our regional organization  the African Union  and the United Nations in managing these crises in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. This is the case in Côte d’Ivoire with the creation of an international working group.  By deciding to hold the meeting of its Peace and Security Council on Darfur here in New York City  the African Union has reiterated its willingness to consider all constructive proposals regarding this conflict. The African Union’s unflagging efforts to ensure peace in Darfur has never been in question. The seriousness of the situation in this region of the Sudan calls for more energetic and more effective action. We solemnly call on the Government of the Sudan to make a full assessment of the tragedy that is taking place before our eyes.  In the case of Somalia  we appeal to the international community to provide its support to efforts to re-establish peace and reconciliation in Somalia. The international community must not lose patience faced with the meagre results in the search for peace in several of the African conflicts. The international community must provide strong support for the efforts undertaken at many levels with  of course  the agreement of the countries concerned. As the current chair of the African Union  we promise to work fully to promote peace and security on the continent.  I do not wish to end my statement on this subject without recognizing the courage of peacekeepers throughout the world  especially in Africa. Our gratitude also goes out to the civil society and humanitarian organizations that work courageously and with dedication to relieve the suffering of people.  One of the major challenges that I mentioned earlier is that of development. The international community dealt especially with this question during the Millennium Summit by establishing the Millennium Development Goals to be achieved before 2015. The assessment that we conducted last year revealed serious weaknesses. It was clearly apparent that resources were lacking and that it was essential to look for new sources of financing.  Also  we must give due credit to the initial responses to the appeal launched here a few months ago during the High-Level meeting held on eradicating HIV/AIDS  within the framework of our commitment to achieve universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention  treatment and care by 2010.  We welcome the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) initiative launched by the French Government to mobilize resources derived from the taxation of airplane tickets. Congo  among other countries  has joined this initiative. This effort is in line with the Abuja Declaration and Framework for Action for the Fight Against HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases. It is also in line with the Brazzaville Commitment  which presents the common African position. The African Union summit also declared a state of emergency in Africa with regard to those diseases.  In discussing the issue of migration and development a few days ago in this Hall  the United Nations took a look at an area of involvement that has not been sufficiently studied  specifically that of individuals and other entities — business and   3 06-52737  economic institutions — in bringing people together and sharing the common goods of our planet.  The African Union  meeting in Banjul  took this opportunity to declare a common position that emphasized the positive nature of the role that should be played by migration if it is correctly integrated into an approach to profitable development for the receiving countries  as it is for the countries of origin of the migrants.  Our Organization has launched a vast reform programme  of which some results are already tangible. A few moments ago  I talked about the establishment of the Human Rights Council  as well as the Peacebuilding Commission. Organizational reform seeks to adapt our Organization to changes that have occurred throughout the world over the past 60 years.   The African Union has made the reform of the Security Council and the reinvigoration of the General Assembly a major issue of concern. We must improve the representative nature of the Security Council  which is the true lynchpin of the entire institutional architecture of the United Nations.  The African proposal for an equitable enlargement of the membership of the Council constitutes a fundamental pursuit  which cannot be replaced by simple palliative measures. We also believe that the Security Council must improve its procedures and its working methods to lay the basis for consensual work. On subjects as serious as counter-terrorism or nuclear non-proliferation  seeking a consensus must continually be pursued through cooperation and dialogue. Between those who give priority to compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and those who  rightly or wrongly  call for effective  concomitant disarmament and the recognition of a universal right of access to technologies in all areas  there is no doubt much to be discussed  but this must be done in good faith.  We must refrain from radicalizing our attitudes by turning the discussion into a conflict of values or civilizations  because  most often  the problem is really only due to a lack of dialogue and communication.  All these problems and challenges prove  if even there was a need to do so  the importance of the United Nations. The United Nations is necessary because it is the instrument of international relations; it is the enzyme that can give us global peace and security; it is  really  the conscience of mankind. The world would not be what it is  without the United Nations.  Still  our Organization has not succeeded  in spite of this confident affirmation of its role  in changing with times to fulfil the deepest aspirations of nations and peoples. We know that the United Nations can achieve that goal if the nations that created it  nations throughout the world  from the most powerful to the most humble  were to give to the United Nations  without hindrance or hypocrisy  the means that it needs to serve humanity.  Africa  I can assure you  is prepared to do its part in this highly anticipated debate. "
"38",1541,"COL",61,2006,"I congratulate you  Madam President  and wish you the greatest success in this session.  Four years ago I attended this global forum for the first time to announce that Colombia was beginning an era of democratic security. I explained why security in our time is a democratic value without which freedoms cannot prosper; it is also a centre of resources  in whose absence investment does not flow and the possibility of eliminating poverty and building equality remains elusive.    06-52988 6   Four years ago I explained to the Assembly why our concept of security is democratic and thus deserves the support and confidence of all peoples and of the United Nations.  I am aware that I could not address the Assembly today to propose a theory of democratic security; having been President of my country for four years  I feel compelled to present the results of this policy. Colombia has held four general elections and countless local elections over this period. The referendum and the election of mayors and governors in 2003 were events that tested our democratic meaning of security. This year the presidential and congressional elections  held on two separate dates under a high threat of terrorism  were nonetheless among the most peaceful in many decades. All political groupings enjoyed effective guarantees  regardless of their level of support for or opposition to the Government.  Under democratic security  Colombia has elected mayors  governors and members of Congress of all political colours. Security has contained terrorism in order to give democracy free expression.  There is still much to be done in the area of security  and a definitive peace is not yet within sight  but progress is undeniable. The effective protection of Colombians translates into the reduction in the number of homicides  kidnappings  acts of terrorism  crimes and threats against journalists and trade union leaders. All governors and mayors exercise their powers in their own jurisdictions  overcoming the nightmare of exile that many were subjected to as a result of terrorist actions that were not countered by the State.  To guarantee the sustainability of security over time  our citizens must give it credibility. Our task is to build credibility based on effectiveness and transparency. Consequently  human rights are an imperative of security. In recent years we have increased our security forces by 30 per cent  military operations have tripled  and at the same time complaints against the security forces have fallen by 38 per cent. This is all the more important because we are a country with full internal democracy  completely open to supervision and international criticism  as borne out by the presence of an office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  In spite of the work still to be done  the most important achievement is our citizens’ positive assessment of security and the collective determination to consolidate it.  We regard organized violence for fictitious political motives as terrorism  and security as the path to peace. When a country has a pluralist  vigorous and guarantee-granting democracy  armed actions against it are pure terrorism. To deny this would erase the difference between armed combat against dictatorships  which merited the recognition of insurgent groups in other countries  and the violent aggression suffered by our democracy  which is terrorism.  The demobilization of more than 40 000 members of violent groups  as a result of democratic security  and the efforts proposed by the country to reintegrate them into constitutional life  prove that for us security is the path to peace and reconciliation.  Talking about 40 000 demobilized is easy; tallying them up is very difficult; demobilizing them is even more difficult; and reintegrating them is a monumental task. Amidst understandable controversy  we have made progress in dismantling irregular forces. Today the vast majority of illegal self-defence groups — which  together with the guerrillas  until two years ago seemed like powers greater than the State — are demobilized  and a large percentage of their leaders are being held by our justice system. These results are more eloquent than rhetoric ever could be. I must add that the number of demobilized guerrillas is higher than the number killed by official forces.  I have come to the United Nations today to ask for resolute support for our security policy and our reintegration programme. The violence in Colombia has received much international media coverage  constant criticism of the Government and little support to overcome it. It is time for the international community to urgently call on violent groups to make peace without any further delay. The Government is as firm in implementing security as it is rigorous in respecting democratic rules  and is open and generous in looking for peace. A sincere willingness for peace will not face governmental obstacles to a definitive reconciliation.  The international community must support our security policy more decisively. This will bring quicker results from our overcoming violence and seeking peace.   7 06-52988   The financing of violent groups by illicit drugs is one of the fundamental aspects that differentiate those groups from former guerrillas in other Latin American countries. This criminal  bottomless and autonomous financing is the main obstacle to peace.   It grieves me to say that progress in the fight against illicit drugs has been small compared with the sacrifice made by the people of Colombia and the Government’s willingness to eradicate those drugs. The number of extradited citizens  the confiscation of illicit wealth and the areas sprayed represent enormous efforts  but the results are not proportional. For the second straight year  we have a programme for massive manual eradication  which will mean 70 000 hectares of coca destroyed.  Production and consumption require a global commitment transcending formal declarations  so as to increasingly apply programmes that reflect actions of shared responsibility.  There are successful alternative development projects. A few weeks ago  the United Nations positively assessed the forest keeper families programme  which covers 43 000 rural families that have replaced drug cultivation with protection of the forest and the growing of alternative crops. Some  such as those in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta  offer ecotourism services. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  drugs have been eliminated in 80 per cent of the area of the forest keeper families  covering 2 million hectares. More than 136 000 hectares of tropical forest have been reclaimed. Thanks to payments by the Government  these families have already acquired more than 30 000 hectares of productive land. Nevertheless  to protect a high percentage of the Colombian Amazon jungle and tropical forest  we need to reach 120 000 families. That is a great budgetary challenge  requiring more general and decisive international support.  The programme halts the cutting down of tropical forest and the Amazon jungle  which have suffered the destruction of nearly 2 million hectares because of drugs. I ask the world: why is there not less rhetoric and a greater and more effective commitment  so that Colombia  which is absolutely willing to achieve it  may finally and definitively overcome the scourge of illegal drugs?  We Colombians do not want to be left with efforts and sacrifices; we require results. We are willing to revise our strategy and improve it  but we need the entire world to get involved with us. I ask the United Nations for additional efforts to help us find ways to be effective.  We reiterate our enthusiastic commitment to meet the Millennium Development Goals. Social cohesion  overcoming poverty and building equity are essential aspirations of our democracy. In 2002 poverty reached almost 60 per cent of the population; in 2005 it was down to 49 per cent. We will do everything possible to ensure that it does not exceed 35 per cent by 2010 and to reach the goal of 15 per cent by 2019  the second centenary of our independence. Fortunately  the Gini coefficient is beginning to show a trend towards correction in income distribution.  Our goals for the upcoming four-year period are ambitious: achieving full coverage in health and basic education and significant progress in basic sanitation and providing microcredit for 5 million poor families.   We want a modern democracy with security  freedom  social cohesion  transparency and independent institutions. This is our dream; this is what we are fighting for. We want a nation without exclusions and without class hatred  with harmony  rectitude and prosperity; a nation in permanent democratic dialogue  with fraternity and without insurmountable antagonisms; a nation integrated into multilateralism  grateful for the efforts of the United Nations  receptive to the international community’s suggestions and willing to share its experiences and improve its results. "
"39",1581,"COM",61,2006,"Allow me  first of all  on behalf of the people of the Comoros  my Government and in my personal capacity  to sincerely congratulate you  Madam President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am convinced that your eminent qualities will enable you to skilfully guide the work of this General Assembly. And I assure you of my readiness to work with you towards the successful accomplishment of the difficult mission entrusted to you by our General Assembly.   I take advantage of this opportunity to address our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  and to express my deepest gratitude for the total and resolute commitment that he has always shown as head of our Organization  in particular  in the promotion of its ideals. We are all aware of the immeasurable efforts that he consistently deploys to defend the noble causes of our institution — the fight against poverty  the maintenance of peace in the world  to list but the main ones.  It is a great honour to take the floor today and to address this Assembly in my capacity as the newly elected President of the Union of the Comoros.   Allow me  therefore  at this historic time  to address my deep gratitude to all of the brother countries  to the United Nations system and to the African Union  in particular  for having become engaged in order to ensure that  for the first time  a democratic and peaceful political transition was able to take place in my country following free and transparent elections. That was indeed a first in the Comoros in  30 years of independence.  At this junction  I would like to underline the principal role played by the Republic of South Africa and by its President  Mr. Thabo Mbeki  in monitoring the electoral operations during the last presidential elections held in the Comoros. These elections are an exemplary model for Africa  in spite of certain imperfections.  I wish to convey to the Government and to the brethren people of the Republic of South Africa the sincere gratitude of the people of the Comoros and my personal acknowledgment for the unfailing support that they provided to the process of national reconciliation in the Comoros.    06-53005 2   I wish to convey to France  a country with which we have long-standing relations  the gratitude of the people and the Government of the Comoros for the constant support that it continues to provide to our country. We are convinced that France  the home country of human rights and freedoms  will meet the request of my Government to ensure that together we can guarantee a harmonious development in the Comoros  with democracy  the rule of law and good governance.  The People’s Republic of China also deserves our deep admiration. With great vigour  this brother country has supported the development of the Comoros  ever since we gained independence more than 30 years ago. Through the quality of its relations  China has earned the friendship of all the people of the Comoros  and I remain convinced that it will continue to provide aid and support for my country’s socio-economic development  a matter which remains a priority for my Government.  The Republic of Mauritius deserves a special mention for its invaluable support to my country throughout the national reconciliation process. By hosting the donor conference for the Comoros in December 2005  this brother country has demonstrated its great solidarity with the Comoros. We therefore express to it our deep appreciation here today.  Madagascar is a country with which we enjoy  over and above formal cooperation  very close relations by virtue of good neighbourliness  blood ties  a shared language and commerce  and it will remain a crucial partner for us. Madagascar has consistently demonstrated the importance of preserving common values  in particular through closer ties. I know that with this brother country we still have a long way to travel together  as our destinies are linked.  From this platform  I would be remiss not to convey our sincere gratitude to all other bilateral and multilateral partners of the Comoros  in particular  the League of Arab States  the International Organization of la Francophonie and the European Union  which  through the African Union  has provided valuable support and assistance in recent years in the context of the national reconciliation process.   I would like to thank sincerely the entire international community for the spirit of solidarity often expressed towards my country. Moreover  I remain convinced that the entire international community will continue to support the Comoros to help it complete national reconciliation. This is the sine qua non to ensure that a period of peace and political stability can take root in my country.  The people of the Comoros hope to see an end to the hellish cycle of coups d’état that have spoiled their daily lives over the past three decades. Since my election as President  my Government and I have strived to find the ways and means to promote social and economic development. We are aware of the need to diversify our cooperation abroad and to create conditions that are propitious to investment. On the domestic level  my Government is resolutely committed to fighting corruption and the embezzlement of public funds  to reestablishing an independent and equitable judiciary and we are committed to improving public housing. In order to achieve these goals  we require the backing our partners in support of our own efforts. That is why I make a solemn appeal to this Organization and to its Members to provide diverse forms of aid in order to ensure the success of this task.  I would be remiss if I did not also touch on the major global issues that we face. The situation in the Middle East remains critical. The conflict that occurred in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah deeply hurt us in our flesh and in our hearts. Once again  we question the grounds for waging that war  the reasons for the destruction of economic infrastructure in that brother country  and finally the loss of thousands of lives. My country deeply deplores the shedding of innocent blood in Lebanon and in the Middle East. Why is there so much violence? Why is there so much suffering? Why is there so much inhumanity?   What is there to say about the situation in Palestine where the same scenario persists with its toll of martyrs  children and women who are victims of blind bombing? It is high time for the international community  working within the framework of the United Nations  to respond and to put an end to that conflict by ensuring that a negotiated solution is reached promptly.  We have the right to ask why the situation in Iraq remains catastrophic. It would be a shameful lie to say that we do not awake each day  learning of a growing number of deaths in each community in Iraq.   In Africa  even though some conflicts have been settled  instability and the risk of war and the threat of   3 06-53005  war still persist in Chad  the Darfur region of the Sudan  Côte d’Ivoire  Eritrea  Ethiopia and Somalia  just to mention some instances.   The question of Moroccan Sahara in no way leaves us indifferent. It is high time that the international community uses the prestige of the United Nations to expedite a solution based on law to that long-standing dispute. In any such situation  only the application of international law can guarantee the restoration of legality.  Asia is not spared its share of armed conflicts  for example those in Sri Lanka  Timor and southern Philippines. To mention all such conflicts would be tedious. Wherever or whenever war takes place  armed conflict inevitably results in millions of displaced persons  destroyed economic infrastructure and irreversible human  social and economic tragedy and damage. We must acknowledge and appreciate the vast effort of the international community to ensure that dialogue  discussion and negotiation prevail over force  destruction and war. Our Organization plays a major role in this respect. We must acknowledge that the crucial missions undertaken by the United Nations are irreplaceable.  We live in a time of paradoxes. On the one hand  we are living through an exceptional period marked by extraordinary growth of knowledge and know-how in the areas of technology  science  economic output  information technology and communications  just to mention a few. Yet on the other hand  we continue to devote almost unlimited financial and technical resources to producing more and more weapons capable of destroying our planet. Our countries are caught up in an arms race  instead of concentrating on development and combating disease and poverty.   At a time when science makes possible considerable progress  as I said earlier  the contradiction persists at the start of the twenty-first century that millions of individuals do not have enough to eat  millions of persons are totally destitute  and too often abject poverty  famine and devastating pandemics prevail. Many families live without shelter or in precarious and unhealthy conditions. Side by side with an increasingly prosperous world  more and more people live in increasingly difficult situations. We must ask ourselves how to overcome these contradictions in order to meet the challenges of the future.  Without going into detail  I wish to touch on the root causes of these problems  their consequences and prospects for the future. In my humble opinion  the reasons for these conditions are twofold. The first concerns governance in countries themselves. It will not surprise you to hear that in many countries  especially in the poorest countries  there is injustice  corruption and a lack of respect for fundamental human rights. The second point concerns international governance and all the related problems. While we live in a globalized world  we must recognize that degradation of the environment from uncontrolled pollution by business motivated by easy profit endangers the lives of future generations. In economic terms  we stand by powerless  witnessing deteriorating terms of trade  which plunge the poorest countries into ever-deepening poverty while the richest countries continue increasingly to prosper.   We believe that in order to achieve peace among men  to seek peace among countries and to ensure lasting peace for each and every one  we must prevent and resolve the conflicts and ills that beset our world. We meet in this forum to seek — and to find — solutions to the problems that I have touched upon in my statement. The permanent quest for material and social well-being should guide us towards a guarantee of better lives for our children. We must attack the root causes of the conflicts breaking out everywhere in the world. It is crucial that we combat pandemics such as AIDS  which has destroyed millions of people worldwide.   Mr. Majoor (Netherlands)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Finally  I wish to use the words of Saint Francis of Assisi who said  “Give us love  my God  so that we might instil it where the forces of evil dominate”. May God the almighty and most merciful inspire our decisions to ensure that a time of peace comes upon us and that we see an end to the spilling of the innocent blood of people in countries at war.  (spoke in Arabic)  The Union of the Comoros has entered into a new period since my accession to the post of head of the supreme Council following the free and transparent elections that were held in May and June. We hope to strengthen our ties with all friendly countries on the basis of mutual respect and common interests. We reaffirm our firm commitment to all international    06-53005 4  conventions and agreements that seek to ensure peace  well being  security and development for all peoples of the world.   The Comoros occupies a distinct strategic position and embraces many civilizations. In spite of the challenges it faces  the Comoros has managed to preserve its African and Arab identities  and its affiliation with Islam: a religion of love  amity  tolerance and peace.   Our country is among the world’s poorest  in spite of the priceless natural resources that we enjoy  such as agriculture  fishing and tourism  in addition to our strategic position in the Mozambique Channel. Incorrect economic politics applied since we gained independence in 1975 and political instability have been among the negative factors that made our country especially poor and backward. Average gross domestic product per capita stands at about $300 per year.   We have therefore developed a far-reaching plan seeking to provide substantial shelter for our population  in place of straw huts. We have sought to establish an independent judiciary in order to ensure the justice and equality of all before the law  and we are combating unemployment and poverty. If we are unable to provide decent and dignified housing and unable to guarantee a minimum of justice  then we will be unable to fight unemployment and poverty.   I would like once again to call upon the international community to continue to provide aid and assistance to my country. I assure members all that their generosity and assistance will reach secure hands and will be used properly and appropriately.  "
"40",1620,"CPV",61,2006,"First of all  Madam  I would like to congratulate you on your election to preside over our work during the General Assembly’s sixty-first session. This is a tribute not only to your qualities  but also to the dedication of your country  because it shows the recognition of Bahrain’s attachment to the principles and actions pursued by the United Nations. This is why  on behalf of the Cape Verde delegation and in my own name  I would like to assure you of our cooperation.  The rapid changes in the modern world are a permanent challenge to the United Nations capacity to preserve the centrality of its role in the promotion of development  peace  security and human rights. These changes involve challenges  opportunities and constraints that we must properly manage in order to create the more balanced  democratic and peaceful world order to which we all aspire.  To confront these challenges  the United Nations must commit itself unambiguously to modernizing and reforming its activities. Being the product of its Member States  the Organization must be granted the resources that are commensurate with its mandate.  Following the decisions and recommendations adopted at the 2005 World Summit  relevant important measures have been adopted. I am particularly grateful for the establishment of the Human Rights Council  the Peacebuilding Commission  the Central Emergency Response fund  the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel  resolutions on development and the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In this connection  I would like to express my country’s gratitude to Mr. Jan Eliasson for his dynamic and efficient guidance of the work of the Assembly’s sixtieth session.  Reform of the United Nations will not be complete unless we reform the Security Council  the Economic and Social Council  the Secretariat and management  indispensable components in our Organization’s efforts to adapt to today’s realities. We must move ahead with an open and flexible attitude  without jeopardizing the principles of equity and justice.  At the internal institutional level  in order for reform to be understood and supported by all the parties concerned  it must be carried out in an inclusive  harmonious and streamlined manner. Cape Verde has agreed to host a pilot project known as the Joint Office Mechanism  a procedure with a common framework for United Nations programmes  agencies and funds  the final objective of which is to enhance the efficiency of operational activities by rationalizing structures and resources and creating synergy at the technical and budgetary levels. The complexity of this experiment and its implications in streamlining operations with the structures on which the JOM depends in New York will call for adjustments in policies  instruments and practices and a permanent dialogue with Governments.   21 06-53952   I am gratified at the selection of the topic of our debate: “Implementing a global partnership for development”. This topic could not be more timely  as many people around the world do not yet enjoy the fundamental human right to live in dignity  without having to worry about poverty or fear. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) remain empty words for these people.   It is deplorable that  despite all scientific progress in our time  underdevelopment continues to be the daily reality for so many men  women and children on the planet. While it is up to national leaders to bear the prime responsibility  we cannot underline enough the importance of a global partnership to restore equity in these situations and create the foundations for development that is more in line with the MDGs.  In that context  the international community should genuinely fulfil its commitments with respect to official development assistance and should establish the conditions for a fairer and more equitable international trading system that would take property account of small  vulnerable economies  including those of island States.  In the specific case of Africa  I welcome the various initiatives that have been announced  while urging the international community to give our continent a more consistent form of support — one that is more consistent with the MDGs and the positive momentum created by the emergence of new African leaders who are working to promote development  democracy  peace and political and social stability.  Debt reduction  access to direct investment  improving the financing modalities for development and innovative financing efforts are measures that could encourage and support national policy adjustment efforts through improvement of the management of resources. Consistent with the international agenda  initiatives related to external debt should also be extended to medium-low-income countries.  Only two weeks ago  in this very forum  during the High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries  the Cape Verde delegation stated that irrefutable progress had been achieved  but this should not mask the problems and shortcomings that still exist.  In general  we see a mixed record in the implementation of that instrument; this reflects the major constraints that all these countries face in trying to reverse the heavy dynamic of underdevelopment.  In the specific case of Cape Verde  thanks to efforts at the national level  with the support of the international community  social and economic indicators have improved markedly during the country’s 30 years of independence. Considerable progress has been achieved in education and health and in reform of the financial and fiscal sectors and of the State administration. At the political level  reform has made possible the setting-up of a democratic system and the emergence of a cultural and political climate of tolerance and power-sharing. These results provided the basis for the General Assembly’s decision to graduate Cape Verde from the category of least developed countries in 2008.  Cape Verde is aware that to consolidate these efforts requires a sustained financial effort that it cannot make on its own. Let us recall that Cape Verde is a small island country without natural resources and exposed to permanent drought and external shocks. In addition  its economic vulnerability outweighs the two other criteria required for graduation from the category of least developed country. The Government accepted this new challenge fully convinced that it is primarily responsible for drafting and implementing the best possible development model in the interests of the people of Cape Verde. That is why it has decided to pursue dialogue with its bilateral and multilateral partners in order to ensure smooth transition  in accordance with the resolution adopted by the General Assembly.  In many ways  the success of this pioneering step largely depends on support from the United Nations system and the broader international community. The transition support group that has been created has the responsibility of helping us to clarify the goals and modalities of graduation and to set in motion a new partnership for creating a new and more agile economic momentum that will make us less vulnerable.  Climate change and environmental degradation have harmful effects on ecosystems  especially in small island developing States such as Cape Verde. The international community must provide strong support for the effective implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the    06-53952 22  Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.  The deadlock in negotiations on disarmament issues  transnational organized crime  clandestine immigration and its human  political  social  cultural and economic impact  endemic diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis and the rapid expansion of HIV/AIDS are causes of deep concern  particularly in small  poor countries. Here again  the international community must act together and quickly.  Terrorism continues to threaten international peace and stability. Cape Verde  which has signed the main legal instruments to combat terrorism  supports the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) launched at the beginning of the current session of the General Assembly. The Strategy sends a clear message about the determination of the United Nations to address the root causes of this scourge and combat it in all its forms and manifestations. We are convinced that it will contribute to removing the difficulties surrounding negotiations on an international counter-terrorism convention.  While there are unresolved conflicts  others are breaking out in various places  constantly vying for attention and action by the international community. The situation in the Middle East has recently escalated with the confrontation between Lebanon and Israel. This has led to unspeakable human suffering and tremendous material damage in both countries and throughout the region. No one can remain indifferent in the face of this conflict  which has continued far too long  60 years  and which remains a major cause — indeed  the epicentre — of international instability.  Cape Verde supports the idea of a comprehensive strategy  the only viable key to which would be the peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) contains important provisions that could serve as a basis for such a strategy. Cape Verde urges all the parties concerned to resume dialogue and negotiations. The international community  in particular the United Nations  must strive to create conditions for restoring confidence and establishing lasting peace  which are preconditions for economic integration and the promotion of intercultural dialogue in the region.  In Africa  while renewed hope accompanies the peacebuilding process in Burundi  Liberia  Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the persistence of other sources of tension risks compromising development efforts and perpetrating human tragedy. That is the case in Darfur  where the situation remains fragile and where disagreement among certain parties to the conflict greatly risks compromising the Peace Agreement signed at Abuja in May 2006. Cape Verde endorses the recommendations and appeals issued by the African Union Peace and Security Council at its recent New York meeting  held at the margins of the General Assembly  on the situation in Darfur. We hail the international community and the African Union for their efforts to resolve the crisis  and we encourage them to continue. At the same time  we call upon the parties concerned to make greater efforts at dialogue and find a peaceful solution to the crisis.  I would like to end where I started  speaking of the central role of the United Nations in the democratization of international relations and in the promotion of development  peace and human rights. Allow me to express the appreciation of Cape Verde to Mr. Kofi Annan for his outstanding work over the past 10 years  which has made it possible for the Organization to leave its mark on the course of multilateralism. His work does him credit and it is also to the credit of Africa. As he prepares to leave the post of Secretary-General  we wish him every success in his future endeavours.  "
"41",1666,"CRI",61,2006,"On behalf of the people of Costa Rica  I convey my greetings to the President of the General Assembly and wish her every success. I also greet the Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  Nobel Peace laureate and tireless defender of dialogue and understanding among the peoples of the Earth.  I come before the Assembly overwhelmed by the same emotion and the same sense of urgency as I felt when I did so for the first time  20 years ago. Then  I came burdened with the deepest distress of my people. I came to remind the world that  in the “waist of America”  five small nations were engaged in a struggle between life and death  between freedom and oppression  between war and peace. I came to ask the international community not to let violence turn Central America into a barren land where the seeds of the most beautiful human dreams could not grow.  The world has changed since then. The finest children of Central America no longer inherit war as their birthright  and our countries have ceased to be pawns in the immense global chess game of the cold war.  For Central Americans  it is impossible to think that the old days were better. I am convinced that humanity has reasons to be optimistic and that  as William Faulkner said  man will prevail. But I also know that the progress made towards human freedom  dignity and well-being are no more than small victories in a long and epic battle. We have just set out on the road towards the full realization of human beings  and it is strewn with obstacles.  If we are to continue on the road towards human emancipation from misery  if we are to transform development and human rights into something more than the utopian dream that they are today for hundreds of millions of people throughout the world  we will need more than good intentions. We will need courage to call things what they are  to correct mistakes and to make urgent decisions.  With optimism and vehemence  I propose to the Assembly that we now take three courses of action that could have powerful effects on the well-being of all humanity.  First  we must denounce increases in military spending  the arms race and the weapons trade as offences to the human condition.  Secondly  we must make a reality  through free trade  of the promise that the globalized economy holds for humanity and in particular for the world’s poorest peoples.  Thirdly  we must defend  with all our strength and eloquence  international law and the United Nations  proposing reforms that will enable us successfully to adapt to the tremendous changes that the world is undergoing.  For quite some time I have argued that the struggle for human development is linked to the struggle for disarmament and demilitarization. It is no badge of honour for our species that global military spending exceeded $1 trillion in 2005 — the same level of spending  in real terms  as at the end of the cold war. That represents eight times the annual investment necessary to achieve  in the span of a decade  all the Millennium Development Goals  in every country.   21 06-52737   The investment that the most industrialized nations make in their military — they are responsible for 83 per cent of global military spending — is 10 times greater than the amount of resources that they dedicate to official development assistance. The United States  the richest country on the planet  spends  at the very least  25 times more on the military than it gives in aid. Is this not a clear example of twisted priorities  not to mention profoundly irrational?  Indeed  at the end of the day  rationality is what counts. Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001  global military spending has increased by a little more than $200 billion. There is not a single indicator that suggests that that colossal increase has made the world more secure and human rights more widely enjoyed. On the contrary  we feel increasingly vulnerable and fragile.  Perhaps it is time to think of other ways to deploy those resources. Perhaps it is time to realize that  with a sum much smaller than that one  we could guarantee access to potable water and primary education for every person in the world. Perhaps there would be enough left over  as Gabriel García Marquez once suggested  “to perfume Niagara Falls with sandalwood on an autumn day”. Perhaps it is time to understand that this is what would probably make us happier and certainly more secure.  Every weapon is a visible sign of the delay in meeting the needs of the poor. I am not the only one to have said so. The same thing was said  memorably  by a man of arms  President Eisenhower  nearly half a century ago: “Every gun that is made  every warship launched  every rocket fired signifies  in the final sense  a theft from those who hunger and are not fed  those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers  the genius of its scientists  the hopes of its children.”  While it is sad that the richest nations  through military spending  are denying development opportunities to the poorest  it is sadder still that the poor are complicit in destroying their own future. Indeed  it is tragic that the Governments of some of the most underdeveloped countries continue to supply their troops with tanks  warplanes and missiles  supposedly to protect a population afflicted by hunger and ignorance.  My region of the world has not escaped that phenomenon. In 2005  the countries of Latin America spent almost $24 billion on weapons and troops — an amount that has risen 25 per cent in real terms over the last decade and increased substantially in the past year. Latin America has begun a new arms race  even though it has never been more democratic and there have been very few military conflicts between countries in the past century.  In that respect  I believe Costa Ricans have reason to be very proud. Since 1948  thanks to the vision of our former President  José Figueres  a very wise man  Costa Rica abolished its army and declared peace on the world  and we bettered our life.  As I did 20 years ago in my first message to the General Assembly  I can say today with satisfaction that I come from a country without weapons  that our children have never seen a tank  an attack helicopter  a warship or a cannon. As I did 20 years ago  I can say that in my country  fathers and grandfathers explain to the young people the curious architecture of some of our schools  which is due to the fact that  long ago  those schools were military barracks. I can say that in my homeland  none of our citizens  man or woman  knows oppression  and that not a single Costa Rican lives in exile. I can say today that mine is a nation of liberty.  This is a path that neither my country nor I are willing to abandon. Not only that: It is a path that we wish all humanity to follow. Today I would like to propose an idea. I propose that we all give life to the Costa Rican consensus  through which we create mechanisms to forgive debt and provide international financial support to developing nations that invest more and more in education  health and housing  and less and less in soldiers and weapons. It is time that the international financial community reward not only those whose spending is orderly  as it has done to date  but also those whose spending is ethical.  I propose to the Assembly as well that we approve  as soon as possible  an arms trade treaty prohibiting countries from transferring weapons to States  groups or individuals if there is reason to believe that such arms will be used to violate human rights or international law  or if there are clear indications that they will be used to hinder the process of sustainable development.    06-52737 22   I hope that the United Nations  at this session of the General Assembly  will approve the formation of a governmental group of experts that will draft the text of a binding treaty on the subject of international arms transfers.  It is time to close the door on the arms trade and on the endless trail of death it leaves in its wake. It is time also to open the door to other forms of commerce — the legitimate and licit trade of goods and services — on which the prosperity of the peoples of the world depends.  I know that in the Assembly there exists a wide range of opinions about the best way to promote global trade so as to provide genuine opportunities for all countries. In a globalized world  the challenge facing developing nations is simple: if we cannot export more goods and services  we will end up exporting more people.  The strongest argument in favour of opening up economies is  quite simply  that it helps to reduce poverty. I sometimes marvel that some continue to insist that globalization is a negative force that is increasing global poverty. On the contrary: according to the World Bank  the number of people living in poverty has fallen by almost 200 million over the past two decades  largely owing to the advances of India and China — two countries that have embraced globalization and have opened up their markets with particular enthusiasm.  Trade liberalization can thus be defended on the basis of the benefits that it brings for the poorest people. If we truly want to meet the ethical challenge of reducing global poverty  wisdom and caution must prevail so that the Doha round can be successful. But I want to stress that the defence of free trade must be honest and consistent. We should seek commercial exchanges that are equally free for all countries. The practice among developed nations of pressing for the elimination of commercial barriers only in the sectors in which they have a clear comparative advantage is ethically indefensible. Furthermore  developing countries need and demand free trade in agriculture. Until we make progress on this issue  we will have to continue paraphrasing George Orwell’s famous words  and say that in free trade everyone is equal  but some are more equal than others.  Developing countries need development assistance and solidarity from industrialized countries  but what we need from them above all is consistency. If they extol the virtues of a free market  then let that market actually be free. If in their countries they promote admirable forms of social justice through the welfare state  then let them put that principle into practice on an international scale. If their credo of democracy prevails within their borders  then let them support a more just balance of power within all international organizations.  The third major challenge to which I want to refer today is the strengthening of global governance and the reform of its institutions. This task begins with the defence of multilateralism and the strict adherence of all countries to international law and the fundamental principles of the Charter  the most elemental safeguard against anarchy in the world. Costa Rica  since it lacks an army  is perhaps the country most in need of an effective international system to guarantee its security.  It is essential that the most powerful nations on Earth understand that the survival of international law and of the United Nations is fundamental for their own security; that the mere existence of this forum is one of the great achievements of our species; and that the United Nations represents the triumph of hope over fear  of tolerance over fanaticism and of reason over force.  As I stand here today  I would so much like to hear once more the powerful voice of John F. Kennedy  telling the world  as he did in 1961   “To that world assembly of sovereign States  the United Nations  our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace  we renew our pledge of support — to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective  to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak  and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.”  This is the globalization that can transform the lives of all human beings for the better — a globalization in which all countries are  as we are here  equal in rights; a globalization in which each people can make its voice heard and hear the voices of others and in which the exercise of the tolerance that we practise every day in this Hall is the norm  not the exception.  The great British writer Aldous Huxley once wondered whether this world was not another planet’s   23 06-52737  hell. I do not think it is. It is just a marvellous and complex place  inhabited by a species that is barely in its infancy and that  like an infant  has scarcely begun to understand its immense power to create and to destroy.  For good or for ill  our species writes its history in draft form  never cleanly  always debating with itself — like each one of us — in a perpetual conflict between the good and bad angels of our nature. In this conflict  the victories of the human spirit  as certain as they may seem  are always incomplete  gradual and tentative  and setbacks are always possible. The Earth is not hell. It is a place where there is no perfection — and never will be; just goodness and greatness punctuated by misfortunes  errors and suffering.  The indisputable achievements of the past 20 years tell us that  in spite of our sorrows  human beings continue the march of progress. But now is the time to correct costly mistakes  to right our course and to abandon the destructive behaviour that will make our march of progress infinitely more difficult and tortuous than it should be.  If today we do not confront the rise in military spending and the arms trade; if we do not encourage the poorest countries to invest their scarce resources in life and not in death; if we do not conquer the fear and hypocrisy that impede truly free trade throughout the world; and if we do not strengthen the institutions and the international norms that can protect us against global anarchy  we will be condemned to walk on the edge of a precipice and to engage in futile actions  having to start all over again  like Sisyphus  after every achievement.  I believe that we must supplement optimism with courage and the will to change. I believe that it is time for humanity to build the brightest future that we could possibly dream of. "
"42",1735,"CUB",61,2006,"As President Hugo Chávez said in his brilliant statement  only four days ago the Fourteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement  held in Cuba  concluded. Today I speak on behalf of the Movement’s Chairman  President Fidel Castro  fulfilling our obligation to inform the Assembly of the main decisions agreed at the summit conference in Havana.  As First Vice-President of the Council of State and Minister of the Republic of Cuba  Raúl Castro  said in his opening speech:  “The current international situation  characterized by the one super-Power’s irrational attempts to control the world  aided by its allies  shows that we need to be increasingly united in defence of the principles and purposes upon which the Non-Aligned Movement was established  which are those enshrined in international law and the Charter of the United Nations.”  While the founding of the Movement was necessary more than four decades ago  its continued relevance in today’s world is beyond doubt. The summit held in Cuba was an indisputable success  in spite of the threats and pressures of those who oppose the unity and common efforts of the countries of the south. The summit saw high levels of participation  in    06-52879 24  terms both of the number of countries attending the conference and of the attendance of heads of State or Government. Profound and fruitful debates were held in an atmosphere of true understanding  unity and cohesion  which allowed for the adoption of documents of crucial importance to the role of the Non-Aligned Movement.  As the new Chairman  Cuba was given clear mandates and an action programme that will govern its activities as head of the Movement. As a result of the summit  the Non-Aligned Movement has been strengthened and consequently so has the political unity of the countries of the South. The diverse and heterogeneous nature of the Movement’s membership  far from weakening it  constitutes its essential strength. These features have allowed for the creation of solid consensus that will be a positive contribution to our efforts to overcome the many and serious challenges humanity faces today. The commendable work of Malaysia as the Movement’s Chairman over the past three years was acknowledged at the Summit. There was no cause or demand by a country of the south which was not duly considered or which did not meet with the support of the Movement.  Progress in the defence of multilateralism  demanding respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States  and ensuring the full realization of our peoples’ right to development and peace were ratified at the Summit as the Movement’s principles  whose implementation was urgently needed. The Heads of State or Government decided to work to suppress acts of aggression or other actions contrary to the preservation of peace and to encourage the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  The summit called on all nations to abstain from the use of force or from threatening to use force against the territorial integrity or independence of any State. Participating nations promoted the development of relations of friendship based on respect for the principle of equal rights and the will of all peoples to struggle against foreign occupation. They urged nations to extend international cooperation with a view to overcoming the serious economic  social  cultural and humanitarian challenges that face the world and to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental liberties of all for the benefit of all. The fundamental and inalienable right of all peoples to self-determination was reaffirmed in Havana. The non-aligned countries agreed that world peace and security are today more imperilled than ever as a result  among other factors  of the growing trend of the most powerful States to resort to unilateral measures and to the threat of pre-emptive wars.  The Movement’s commitment to general and complete disarmament  and nuclear disarmament in particular  under strict and efficient international monitoring  was underscored. The summit also reaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all States to research  develop  produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to be free from any kind of discrimination in this connection  in conformity with their respective international obligations. Similarly  the summit clearly and firmly pronounced itself to be against terrorism  double standards in international relations  coercive unilateral measures against any nation  regime-change policies  and the failure of developed countries to fulfil their commitments in economic and social areas.   The heads of State or Government reaffirmed their hope to live in a peaceful world in which all nations have the right to a better future and a fair and equitable world order based on the sustainable development of all nations. They affirmed that in its current form globalization perpetuates and even exacerbates the marginalization of the countries of the south and demanded that it be radically transformed into a positive force for change for the benefit of all peoples.  The participants reaffirmed the right of the Palestinian people to have their own State  and condemned the Government of Israel for the new wave of crimes and massacres in Gaza and other occupied territories. They also vigorously condemned Israel’s merciless acts of aggression against Lebanon and the serious violations of that nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.  The people and Government of Bolivia  facing attempts to destabilize the country instigated by external forces  received a gesture of support and solidarity from the summit. The process under way in that sister nation  aimed at guaranteeing the real rights of all Bolivians and at securing full national control over the country’s natural resources  was offered solid support.  The Movement considered with great concern the aggressive policies and intensification of action aimed at undermining the stability of the Bolivarian Republic   25 06-52879  of Venezuela and expressed support for the inalienable right of the Venezuelan people to determine its form of government and choose its economic  political and social system  free from foreign intervention  subversion  coercion or restrictions of any kind. The non-aligned undertook to promote and participate in a true process of democratization and reform of the United Nations so as to leave behind the anti-democratic impositions and practices of the Security Council and to give the General Assembly its due decisive role  in conformity with the roles and powers described in the United Nations Charter.   I have mentioned only a few examples of the positions adopted at the summit held in Havana with respect to the most diverse issues on the international agenda. The documents adopted will be officially distributed to all United Nations Member States. A number of the decisions adopted at the summit will soon be put into practice at this session of the General Assembly.  Cuba is aware of the immense responsibility inherent in presiding over the Non-Aligned Movement at one of the most difficult times in human history  when we face more inequality and injustice than ever before. We shall not rest in our efforts to have the Movement occupy the place it can and must occupy in the international arena  in keeping with not only its broad membership of 118 countries — nearly two thirds of the membership of the United Nations — but also its history of acting on behalf of the loftiest causes.  Inaugurating the Sixth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana 27 years ago  President Fidel Castro said:  “The struggle for peace and for a just economic order and a workable solution to the pressing problems that weigh on our peoples is  in our opinion  increasingly becoming the main question posed to the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. Peace and the immense risks that threaten it  is not something that should be left exclusively in the hands of the big military Powers. Peace is possible  but world peace can only be assured to the extent that all countries are consciously determined to fight for it — peace  not just for a part of the world  but for all peoples.” A few days later in this same Hall  reporting on that summit  President Castro said:  “The sounds of weapons  of threatening language  and of arrogant behaviour in the international arena must cease. We have had enough of the illusion that the problems of the world can be solved by nuclear weapons. Bombs may kill the hungry  the sick  and the ignorant  but they cannot kill hunger  disease or ignorance. Nor can they kill the righteous rebellion of the peoples.”  The countries of the South will work united for justice  peace and the development of our nations and the entire world  convinced that a better world is possible if we all struggle for it.  I should now like to say a few words on behalf of the people and Government of Cuba. Our people’s exercise of its right to self-determination faces new threats. The Bush Administration has stepped up its brutally hostile measures against Cuba with new economic sanctions that further intensify what is already the longest blockade human history has known. More severe reprisals are also being taken against those from other nations who have business dealings with Cuba  and financial transactions with our country are viciously persecuted. The very Government of the United States recognizes that it is spending more today in persecuting and punishing those who have business dealings with Cuba than in monitoring the finances of those who attacked the twin towers.  This past June the Bush Administration approved the second version of its most recent plan of aggression and domination against our country  aimed not only at overthrowing the revolution but also at destroying the Cuban nation. In violation of international norms and laws  an unprecedented build-up of financial and material support for subversive actions aimed at overthrowing the constitutional order freely chosen by the Cuban people is being promoted. That anti-Cuban plan contains a chapter that is being kept secret.   The precedents for these decisions are the covert actions undertaken against the Cuban revolution  which include mercenary invasions  terrorist actions  the introduction of plagues and epidemics to the country  and more than 600 plots to assassinate Fidel. Thousands of Cubans have lost their lives or been maimed for life as a result of this criminal policy. As the height of hypocrisy and irresponsibility  the Government of the United States tolerates the presence of  and protects  the terrorists who plan new actions against our people on United States soil. While manoeuvring to free the murderers responsible for monstrous crimes — such as the notorious    06-52879 26  international terrorist and CIA agent Luis Posada Carriles  whom they refuse to extradite to Venezuela — the United States Government is illegally and unjustly keeping five courageous anti-terrorist Cuban activists in prison.   In spite of all these acts of aggression and the criminal blockade  the Cuban people will never be defeated. Cuba’s internationalist efforts continue unhindered. More than 30 000 Cuban doctors and other Cuban health professionals are saving lives in 68 different countries today. We are participating in the struggle against illiteracy on several continents. We are developing a plan to train 100 000 doctors for the third world  and we are helping hundreds of thousands of people in many countries to regain their sight through Operation Miracle. With these efforts we are just fulfilling our fundamental duty in solidarity to aid all the peoples of the world.  Cuba is making progress and will continue to advance and face the future with optimism and unity. Its educated and hard-working people  who consider humanity to be their homeland  will struggle hand in hand with the peoples the Assembly represents for the right to live in peace  justice and dignity for all.

"43",1781,"CYP",61,2006,"Before proceeding with my remarks  I wish to indicate that Cyprus  as a member of the European Union  is represented by the Union and fully subscribes to the statement delivered this morning by the President of Finland on behalf of the European Union. I should also like to express my sincere congratulations to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of this session of the General Assembly  and my gratitude to Mr. Jan Eliasson  President during the sixtieth session  for his tireless efforts during a historic year for the United Nations. I also wish to thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization (A/61/1)  highlighting the problems  the concerns and the achievements of the United Nations and providing guidance on the way forward. I would like moreover to warmly welcome the Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United Nations.  During the session that followed the 2005 World Summit  implementation of the Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1)  and the reform process more generally  absorbed an important part of the work of the Organization. The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council  alongside other important achievements  constitutes an important building block towards a consolidated international system based on effective multilateralism. We should  however  not lose sight of the fact that the legitimacy and the relevance of the reform achieved will be judged by its impact on the lives of our peoples. In that respect  let me underline that as a country whose priority lies with upholding the integrity of international law and full respect for human rights  we have a strong interest in seeing a Human Rights Council that fulfils its mandate and leads to human rights improvements on the ground.  There are also aspects of reform that continue to elude us  such as Security Council reform and a comprehensive convention against terrorism; aspects that remain in progress  such as management reform  mandate review and system-wide coherence; and challenges that are increasingly more difficult to tackle  such as disarmament and non-proliferation.    06-52737 18   In that regard  I would like to commend the President of the General Assembly for choosing the achievement of the development goals as the theme of her presidency in recognition of their enduring importance. My Government believes that concerted  innovative multilateral action to eradicate the scourges deriving from poverty and underdevelopment can yield substantial results. In that connection  Cyprus has joined France  Brazil  Chile  Norway  the United Kingdom and other countries in deciding to introduce a special levy on air tickets  the proceeds of which will fund improved access to medication in developing countries.  Regrettably  the urgent need to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East manifested itself in a very dramatic manner once again this summer. For almost four weeks  the international community witnessed a violent crisis in Lebanon that caused indescribable suffering  devastation and a deplorably high number of casualties among civilians. We offer our sympathy and concern to the Governments of Lebanon and Israel and to the families of all those affected.  Firmly convinced that there is no military solution to such crises  Cyprus  from the very first moment of the outbreak of violence  supported the calls for an immediate ceasefire and joined in the effort to provide assistance both to the Lebanese people and to the evacuees. Unfortunately  it took almost a month for the Security Council to discharge its responsibilities effectively towards the peoples of the region  causing disappointment and frustration. In our search for United Nations-centred  effective multilateralism  the lessons learned from that crisis should be a strong guiding force. We hope that the expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  to whose deployment  operations and support Cyprus has undertaken to contribute  will be effective in preventing future eruptions of violence.  In parallel to the Lebanese crisis  the world continues to witness the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories  with a heavy civilian toll and worsening humanitarian conditions. A year after the positive prospects created by Israeli disengagement from Gaza  the current crises serve as a reminder of the urgent need for a new strategy that would lead to a comprehensive and lasting settlement of all facets of the Middle East question on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions. In that respect  it is imperative to urgently revert to the implementation of international agreements  including the road map  providing for the creation of a viable Palestinian State that will peacefully coexist side by side with Israel within agreed borders.  Let me now turn to the Cyprus problem — a problem of the invasion and continuing occupation by Turkish military forces of 37 per cent of the territory of my country for more than 32 years now. Mistaken by some for a protracted conflict  the Cyprus problem essentially epitomizes the inability of the international community to redress this set of massive violations of international legality. The status quo remains unchanged and the humanitarian and human rights consequences of the forcible division of the island and its people persist. The efforts to establish a separate political and legal entity within the occupied area of Cyprus by the occupying Power remain undiminished. Only with respect to investigating the fate of persons missing since the invasion and establishing the circumstances of their disappearance have we recently witnessed some encouraging developments.  In the political field  we have continued to exert efforts on two key axes  coming closer to a negotiating process that would guarantee a peaceful settlement  alleviate the consequences of the invasion and bring about the reunification of Cyprus  its territory  people  society  economy and institutions in a bizonal  bicommunal federation.  The political agenda of projecting a separate political entity in Cyprus has been pursued in recent years under the pretext of a campaign to lift the so-called isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community. However  with the annual per capita income in the occupied areas of Cyprus currently standing at approximately $11 000  it is evident that the argument for economic development is being exploited for political reasons and is a manifestly unsubstantiated allegation. A recent example of that pattern of behaviour is the refusal of the Turkish side to consider our proposal to increase trading activity by reopening the port of Famagusta for exports to other States members of the European Union  in cooperation with the European Commission  following the return of the now fenced-off and derelict city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants under the control of the Cyprus Government.   19 06-52737   The Greek Cypriots remain committed to reunification through a functional bizonal  bicommunal federation. The failure of the most recent initiative did not alter our commitment or our willingness to work resolutely towards the reunification of our country. The proposed plan was not accepted precisely because it did not provide for the reunification of our divided country or address core issues and key concerns in a satisfactory manner. The search for a settlement firmly remains for us in the United Nations framework  within the context of the good offices mission mandated to the Secretary-General by the Security Council.  I would now like to turn briefly to developments of a political nature that have taken place over the past few months and to our attempts during that time to create the right conditions for the resumption of meaningful negotiations in the framework of the good offices mission of the Secretary-General for a viable settlement of the Cyprus problem. To that end  I wish to emphasize our concurrence with the opinion of the Secretary-General that good and careful preparation of any negotiating process is necessary before full-fledged negotiations can take place. It was thus agreed that bicommunal discussions at the technical level would commence to address substantive aspects of the Cyprus problem  as well as issues that affect the everyday life of all Cypriots as long as the status quo persists — a process that could be complemented by parallel confidence-building. This expert-level process is a sine qua non for the preparation of issues and their presentation to the leaders of the two communities for the purpose of meaningful negotiation. The method of initiating these technical discussions was agreed to by the two communities during the recent visit to Cyprus of Under-Secretary-General Gambari. Here  I wish to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the good offices of Mr. Gambari  as well as for the continuing efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special Representative  Mr. Michael Møller.  Addressing these core issues — which must be settled satisfactorily if there is to be a feasible solution — should facilitate the attainment of the broader objectives of a settlement  which should be based on international law  the relevant United Nations resolutions  the high-level agreements  the European Union acquis and the relevant decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. That entails establishing a bicommunal and bizonal federal State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality and with a single citizenship. It must also guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus  without any foreign troops on its soil and without the possibility of foreign intervention. A settlement must aim  through a rational approach and a common vision of the future  to preserve and uphold the character of the State as a working democracy and to ensure the reunification of society and the convergence of allegiances to common institutions. Ethnic origin  political equality as defined in the relevant United Nations resolutions  and cultural and religious diversity should be safeguarded  but not at the expense of the fundamental rights of citizens and the functionality and efficiency of State institutions.  We had hoped that by now  Turkey’s course of accession to the European Union would have had a catalytic effect  producing the necessary political will on the part of Turkey and changing its perception of Cyprus from that of an adversary to that of a partner  a valuable neighbour and a potential ally in the European Union. Such a change in attitude would render completely anachronistic those considerations that have led the country to maintain its occupation army in Cyprus and that fuel its confrontational approach.  We continue to expect Turkey to at least proceed with the implementation of its legally binding obligations vis-à-vis the European Union. This is a unique opportunity for Turkey to prove its willingness to turn the page by meeting obligations that it undertook years ago. Unfortunately  it has so far persistently refused to comply with them. Instead  our generous attitude towards Turkey’s accession to the European Union has met with a blockade against my country in its bid to join several international and regional organizations and with Turkey’s refusal to open its ports and airports to Cypriot vessels  as required.  We still believe that in our relations with Turkey  there is only one way forward: creating a future of peace and cooperation  building bridges and mutual understanding  normalizing our relations and working hand in hand to achieve the goals of the European Union in our region. That would also enable us to address all outstanding issues to the benefit of all — especially the Turkish Cypriot community  which would have major opportunities to thrive and flourish if Turkey were to accept and acknowledge that it has no vested interests in Cyprus and must therefore relinquish all forms of interference in my country’s    06-52737 20  affairs. Once again  I invite Turkey to recognize that there is no room for military doctrines with regard to Cyprus and to join us in seeking a lasting solution for the benefit of all Cypriots — Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike — of Turkey and of our entire region.

"44",1805,"CZE",61,2006,"Let me start by congratulating you on your election  Madam President  and by wishing you every success in the coming months of hard work. The outgoing president of the General Assembly  Mr. Eliasson  left an impressive track record of progress on a number of reform issues. It is my expectation that you will continue to meet the high standards set by him.   Behind many of the changes here at the United Nations over the past decade we have noted the light and decent hand of one distinguished person  Mr. Kofi Annan. As he prepares to leave his position at the helm of the Secretariat  I would like to take this opportunity to thank him most cordially for all he has done. He has made it very difficult and challenging for his successor to do the job with the same vigour  skill and dedication.  To choose the right successor to the Secretary-General will definitely not be an easy task  but I do not want to leave the Hall without stating clearly the preferences of my country. No one from my own regional group has thus far occupied this important post. We think that time has come to seriously consider such an option. Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia is an excellent candidate who qualifies perfectly well for the position of Secretary-General. She can count on our full support.  Let me also welcome a new Member of the United Nations  the Republic of Montenegro  whose presence here brings us closer to the goal of a truly universal United Nations.  The President of Finland spoke on behalf of the European Union (EU) a few days ago. The Czech Republic fully associates itself with that statement. The EU has made an enormous effort to contribute to the preparations for this session  and my country was an integral and active part of that process. I shall therefore limit myself to sharing with the Assembly just a few ideas and comments on issues that are at the forefront of our interests.  I strongly believe that all of us want the world to be a safer place. That is the bottom line. Yet  the absence of safety and security seems to be almost omnipresent. There is a lack of support for billions of people suffering from hunger and disease in developing countries. There is a lack of protection for many people exposed to various environmental risks and natural hazards. There is a widening debate regarding energy security. There is lack of freedom and dignity for many women and men living under oppression. There is a lack of peace  and a sense of vulnerability vis-à-vis all kinds of armed conflict.     06-53952 2   On top of all that there is the ominous threat of terrorism — often fed by Islamist extremists — which is creating fear and striking targets around the world  including their very own countries. All that makes it imperative for us to continue to adapt our security systems; otherwise we will not be able to face that threat. And we need to be efficient.  To make the world a better and safer place is a complex challenge. It involves individual States as well as various international organizations. But  at the global level  the role of the United Nations in responding to that challenge is irreplaceable. The Millennium Summit of 2000 and the 2005 World Summit contributed enormously to shaping our agenda to that effect by  inter alia  balancing security  development and human rights concerns. We know what should be done. But we often fail to deliver because our collective will is not strong enough to support the implementation of designed measures and actions. We often know the diagnosis. We know the right remedy. And  yet  we are unable to apply it.  Two weeks ago  we commemorated the fifth anniversary of the horrible terrorist attacks against not only the United States but  dare I say  against our shared values. The world after 9/11 is not what it was  and the United Nations has had to adapt accordingly. On the eve of that chilling anniversary  we succeeded in adopting the landmark United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  building on previous efforts by both the Security Council and the General Assembly. I hope that the Strategy will provide more than guidance  and that it will become a real tool that provides real help for those who fight the scourge of terrorism in the field.  There is general agreement that the international community and the United Nations should do much more for States and territories recovering from conflict and disorder. We now have the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission. There is a spirit of hope that the Commission will lead the efforts in generating both the political will and the means to assist countries in post-conflict environments while promoting the rule of law and democratic values and preventing those countries from slipping back into conflict. The Czech Republic stands ready to assume its duties as a member of the Commission beginning in January 2007.  Peacebuilding has to maintain strong ties with peacekeeping. Indeed  we are facing a surge in demand for that service provided by the United Nations  with Lebanon as the most recent example. But even if the number of Blue Helmets were to be multiplied  there would still be room for meaningful engagement with regional organizations in assisting the United Nations to maintain peace and security. I welcome recent debates on the role of those organizations  which already shoulder a fair part of the burden in Afghanistan  the Balkans  the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sudan. From our trans-Atlantic perspective  I particularly applaud the intensifying cooperation among the United Nations  the EU and NATO. I am proud to say that my country plays an active part in that regard. We have a strong presence in the Kosovo Force and the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. We are prepared to explore other forms of support where we are not directly involved.  It was very unfortunate that last year’s Summit was not able to find common language on disarmament and non-proliferation. The uncontrolled spread of the illicit trafficking in conventional weapons  their use against civilian populations and the deadly existence of landmines all serve to continue to fuel conflict  human suffering and insecurity around the world. My country supports all efforts — as well as several programmes — aimed at bringing the arms trade and the use of arms under strong controls. But there is an even greater threat: the possible proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.   We welcome the fact that the Security Council is increasingly engaged in those matters. Council resolution 1540 (2004) was a major step forward. It was recently followed up by strong messages addressed to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran. Both those countries should fully comply with the nuclear non-proliferation regimes and abandon any ambitions going beyond the peaceful use of nuclear power.  There is no freedom or security where masses of people are plagued by poverty  hunger and unhealthy living conditions. The Government of the Czech Republic therefore attaches great importance to development cooperation and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Following the economic transformation of the 1990s  we have steadily increased our development aid every year. For example  in 2005 Czech development assistance increased by 16 per cent in real terms — reaching a   3 06-53952  level of 0.11 per cent of our gross national income. That likely makes us the leading country providing development assistance among new EU members. Our humanitarian aid grew even more sharply and we are determined to continue that trend. My country also supports other measures that could provide additional assistance — a fair solution to the debt problem for poor countries  limiting agricultural subsidies and creating more open conditions for trade. In that  we associate ourselves with the goal of a global partnership for development.  Development assistance is more effective in an environment of stable and predictable conditions  the rule of law  democratic structures  a successful fight against corruption and respect for human rights — not to mention that those qualities attract donors as they are inherently worth supporting and cultivating. The attention paid to those issues by the United Nations has grown significantly over the last decade  resulting  inter alia  in the establishment of the United Nations Democracy Fund last year. My country was one of the first contributors to the Fund. We are thus on the right track  and I feel that we should go even further along that road.  It was also decided at the United Nations Summit last year — as part of the overall United Nations reform — to transform and upgrade the Commission on Human Rights  which became the Human Rights Council. We have to work hard with others in Geneva  to make it a beam of hope for millions of people living under oppression and deprived of their rights in different parts of the world.   However  the transformation of the United Nations human rights machinery will be a failure  unless the new body is stronger and more effective than the old one  unless it succeeds in enhancing its special procedures and country-oriented activities  unless it finds the ways and means to respond where it is needed  and unless it secures full international cooperation in enforcing elementary standards of fundamental human rights.  Regimes that behave contrary to all democratic principles  use their power against their own citizens  imprison their opponents arbitrarily and violate elementary standards of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights must be confronted with an efficient system. It is one of the sad ironies of our time that Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest in Myanmar  15 years after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.   We cannot remain silent when members of peaceful democratic opposition in Cuba  who are calling for national dialogue and reconciliation  are still jailed and harassed as alleged enemies of the State. We also have to raise our voice of solidarity when a presidential candidate of democratic forces in the recent presidential elections in Belarus  Aleksandr Kozulin  is sentenced to a term in prison for alleged incitement to disorder.  Over several years  “reform” was one of the most frequent and often misused words in our United Nations vocabulary. But  even skeptics must admit that the United Nations in 2006 is profoundly different from the United Nations 10 year ago. While some reform projects were put aside  a number of others were carried out. Some projects — most notably the long overdue reform of the Security Council — continue  however  to wait for the green light.  This year’s highlight is management reform and the reform of the United Nations development machinery in the interest of system-wide coherence. If we succeed in those areas  the United Nations could become stronger  leaner  less bureaucratic and more operational. Let us hope  that the changes will be backed by the adoption of a new and fairer scale of assessments  by adequate budget and payment discipline  and last but not least  by progress in implementing the Capital Master Plan.  In conclusion  let me assure you  Madam President  that my country is ready to fulfil  in a timely and orderly manner  all its obligations as a Member of the United Nations  including our increased share of the overall budget and our contributions to the peacekeeping operations. We acknowledge and honour our share of responsibility. More than that — we continue to increase our volume of humanitarian aid and to engage ourselves in assisting peace and security in a number of areas around the world. I believe that qualifies my country as a strong candidate for an elected seat on the United Nations Security Council for the term 2008-2009. "
"45",1867,"DEU",61,2006,"Please accept my congratulations  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I wish you every success. I should also like to express my sincere thanks to the President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session for his dedicated work and to wish him every success in his future endeavours.  The world events that have taken place over the past 60 years are reflected more graphically in Germany than in almost any other country. Until 1989  the wall and the barbed wire across our country symbolized the division of Europe and the rest of the world into two blocs. Since then  Germany has become the embodiment of the successful overcoming of that division.  Both division and the overcoming of division have influenced our view of the world. For 45 years  peace in Germany was due largely to the friendship and the political and military protection of partner countries  which took their responsibility seriously. That experience shaped the political outlook of Germans. That is why we  too  are now shouldering our responsibility  both in Europe and in other parts of the world. In the context of the United Nations  that means that a reunited Germany believes it has an obligation to do everything it can to support the Organization in creating a more peaceful and more equitable world.  German soldiers and police officers are taking part in numerous peace missions that are either led or mandated by the United Nations. In the Western Balkans  Germany has provided the largest contingent of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Germany is playing a prominent role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Germany is leading the European operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is supporting the first free elections there in 40 years. Germany is engaged in the Sudan through its support for the African Union Mission in the Sudan and the United Nations Mission in the Sudan. And  at this very moment  German navy vessels   29 06-53317  are on their way to the Lebanese coast  where they will reinforce the United Nations peacekeeping force. Germany will contribute up to 2 400 troops to that peace mission.  Germany supports a policy of dialogue and the peaceful reconciliation of differing interests. We firmly believe that political conflicts cannot be resolved through military force or military victories. Peace is brought about by engaging in political dialogue  establishing economic ties and giving people tangible hope for the future. If the parties to a conflict are unable to overcome political divisions on their own  the international community  represented by the United Nations  has an obligation to help. That is the guiding principle of our foreign policy.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs of a reunited Germany  I have been profoundly influenced by German and European history. On that basis  I have a concrete mandate for German foreign policy: we must do everything in our power to prevent the world from dividing once again into hostile blocs. Politicians in every country have a responsibility in that regard. Everyone can — and  I believe  everyone must — make a contribution. It is my firm conviction that anyone who instigates antagonism between people of different cultures and religions is not living up to his or her responsibility.  No one should interpret the involvement of Germany and its partners in the Balkans  in Afghanistan  in the Sudan and in Lebanon as an aggressive global campaign waged by the West against Islam. In a world that has grown closer together than ever before  we do not need exclusion or polarization. Rather  we need the courage to promote understanding and to engage in dialogue.  In the Middle East  it is crucial  following Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  on Lebanon  that we seize the opportunity to promote understanding. I call on all parties to the conflict in the region to act responsibly. Those who want their children and grandchildren to live in peace instead of violence  in safety instead of fear  in prosperity instead of poverty  must have the courage to embark on new paths rather than simply cultivating long-standing enmities.   The principles for a settlement are clear: Israel’s right to exist  on the one hand  and the establishment of a Palestinian State  on the other. Those were the core concerns of the Road Map  to which  I am firmly convinced  we must return. However  if we are to ensure lasting success  we must do everything we can to include everyone involved  even if that seems a roundabout way to achieve our goal. Therefore  I hope that we will succeed in persuading Syria to engage in a constructive dialogue. We need stronger engagement on the part of the international community  particularly the Middle East Quartet. I welcome the Quartet’s recent meeting.  In Afghanistan  the international community is demonstrating how the principle of responsibility can be put into practice in concrete terms. After 23 years of civil war  political structures are now being developed. Millions of refugees have returned to their home country. Just as important  young people — including girls — can go to school again. However  drug cultivation and the security situation pose a threat to the progress that has been made  at least in certain regions of the country. We  the international community cannot allow the successes to date to be brought to naught.  In the Western Balkans  too  war is a thing of the past; I am very pleased to note that that is so. The political and military commitment of the United Nations  the United States of America  Russia and the European Union has played a key role in this. In Kosovo  the task now is to ensure that the two parties to the conflict take their responsibility for peace and stability seriously. A solution to the status of Kosovo  which has remained unresolved for many years  is overdue. Germany staunchly backs the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy  President Martti Ahtisaari. We believe that stability cannot be achieved if the will of only the majority population of Kosovo is expressed. Kosovo Serbs must be guaranteed adequate protections as a minority.  We need only glance at a map of Africa to understand how important the peace and stability of the Sudan and the Congo are for the African continent as a whole. I believe that instability and conflicts in Africa also have a direct impact on Europe. For this reason  too  Germany is supporting the United Nations in its efforts to find a solution to the conflicts in those two countries.  While the United Nations peace mission in southern Sudan — the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) — has made an effective contribution    06-53317 30  towards the implementation of the Peace Agreement between northern and southern Sudan  peace in Darfur is still a long way off. Neither the Sudanese Government nor rebel groups can be absolved of responsibility for the humanitarian disaster in the west of the country. Nevertheless  I am firmly convinced that a lasting solution to the conflict will be possible only if we work with  not against  them.  As members are aware  over the past few years Germany  together with France and Britain  supported by the United States of America  Russia and China  has been intensively seeking a solution to the conflict regarding Iran’s nuclear programme. Let me state clearly that no one wants to deny Iran the right to use nuclear energy peacefully. Nor is isolating Iran the objective of the diplomatic effort. On the contrary  we hope that Iran will become a reliable and responsible partner in the crisis-stricken Middle East. That is why  on 6 June  we offered Iran a package aimed at far-reaching cooperation. The package includes proposals for closer diplomatic  economic and security cooperation  and expressly acknowledges Iran’s right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.  However  the international community also rightly expects cooperation and transparency from Iran. If Iran were to prove that the suspicions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are unfounded and if it sent a clear sign that it truly intends to use its nuclear programme for peaceful purposes only  that could open the door to a development which benefits the people of Iran and the entire region.  It is now up to the Government in Tehran to face up to its responsibility. The decision in favour of peace and stability in the entire Middle East requires courage. I call upon Iran to end the current phase of procrastination and give a clear sign of trust so that we can look to the future together and can finally sit down at the negotiating table.  Resolution of the nuclear dispute with Iran is urgent. However  the challenges of the proliferation of nuclear weapons go far beyond that. We must act now if we want to halt the erosion of the non-proliferation regime. The next attempt to implement the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must not fail.  Not only Iran but also other countries are thinking about developing enrichment technology. We will have to develop new instruments if we want to prevent such risks from arising.  I am therefore strongly in favour of not merely exchanging ideas on the multilateralization of the fuel cycle and transferring responsibility for uranium enrichment to the international community  but of further developing such ideas into concrete options. I therefore appeal for greater efforts to find solutions  working together with the IAEA.  The conflicts in the Middle East  Afghanistan  the Western Balkans and the Sudan  and the dispute with Iran  as well as the fight against international terrorism  have one thing in common: in none of those cases is the West taking a hostile stance against Islam. Nor do they involve a clash of civilizations. Rather  they are very diverse conflicts involving diverse interests.  I believe that there is just one link  albeit a very different one: each one of those conflicts can be resolved only with a willingness and ability to engage in dialogue. That is because dialogue gets everyone concerned involved  engages them and does not allow them to shirk their responsibility for resolving a conflict. However  a policy of cooperation and dialogue does not mean talking at any cost. Those who want to engage in dialogue must meet some basic prerequisites. In my view  these include a readiness to bring about a peaceful reconciliation of interests — that is to say  they must be prepared to renounce violence and respect the position of the other side — and their own position must be consistent and credible. If these prerequisites are not met  then no dialogue with any chance of success can get off the ground.  I am firmly convinced that a dialogue beyond cultural borders can succeed because  despite all of our differences  we are living in one world. The various cultures of the world have more in common than political rabble-rousers would have us believe. People everywhere have the same fundamental interests: they want to live in peace and security  free from poverty. They want good health care and good schools for their children. No responsible Government would ever want to withhold these from its people — nor should they ever be allowed to try to do so.  The United Nations and its agencies and programmes embody this vision — and it is this vision that makes the United Nations so indispensable. I am convinced that we will need the United Nations more than ever in the coming decades. The number and the   31 06-53317  scale of crises in the world are increasing. That could bring about a renaissance of the United Nations even in countries that are sometimes still sceptical about the world Organization.  The effectiveness of the United Nations  its ability to act and the confidence it inspires as the international community’s main multilateral Organization are closely connected. Everyone can see how necessary transparent structures and effective institutions are for the United Nations. The reform of the United Nations — the entire Organization  not just the Security Council — should not  therefore  simply remain on the agenda; concrete progress must be made.  We see the expectations placed on the United Nations rising. This is especially urgent in the case of the review of mandates  as well as management and financial reform. Germany pledges to support this endeavour  because we must reform if we  as members of the international community  wish to remain effective. We owe that not only to the United Nations but  above all  to the people in whose name we shoulder responsibility together. "
"46",1926,"DMA",61,2006,"I would like to extend my congratulations to Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa and to her country  Bahrain  on her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am confident that she will ably build upon the legacy left by her predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden. Mr. Eliasson deserves special recognition for the competent and dedicated manner in which he presided over the sixtieth session and facilitated the positive outcomes that we have witnessed so far in the United Nations reform agenda.  Let me also pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan for his distinguished career as an international civil servant  specifically his 10-year stint as Secretary-General. His wisdom and his unwavering commitment to multilateralism have contributed immensely to a revitalized United Nations. He will most certainly be remembered for his steadfast promotion of human rights  for creating space at the United Nations for civil society and the private sector and for his visionary outlook for the future of the United Nations in the current global dispensation. We wish to thank him for his invaluable service to this Organization and its Member States  and to extend our very best wishes to him in his future endeavours.  The World Summit last year started us on the path of re-engineering the United Nations to make it more relevant and responsive to the many challenges that threaten peace and security in the world at the beginning of this century. The Summit Outcome clearly reflected a historic compromise by Member States on a number of core principles and attendant actions to face squarely the myriad problems confronting the planet. Most importantly  we reaffirmed the commitment we made at the beginning of the millennium to confront the scourge of poverty and to improve the living conditions of millions of people living in abject poverty. Our challenge today is to clarify how the international community can more effectively contribute towards the global goals of poverty alleviation  peace and development for all humanity.  The dynamics of today’s world  conditioned by immense forces of change  have forced us to accept the stark reality that no nation can prosper alone and that the problems we face demand global consensus. Consequently  all of us must emphatically reaffirm central role of the United Nations in the cooperative management of the world’s problems. Dominica firmly supports a rejuvenated United Nations and universal application of its ideals  in particular the maintenance of international peace and security  the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the promotion of international cooperation in solving economic  social  cultural and humanitarian problems.  We welcome progress towards realizing some of the commitments made by world leaders last year. Creation of the Peacebuilding Commission now    06-53615 26  presents a great opportunity for ensuring a tangible connection between conflict resolution and development. It is our hope that the new Human Rights Council will remain focused on its mission and avoid becoming entangled in the politicization that contributed to the eventual demise of its predecessor. The Human Rights Council has made a commendable start with the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  which in turn gives great impetus to the aspirations of the Second United Nations Decade of the World’s Indigenous People  which the Commonwealth of Dominica has steadfastly supported  as one of the few Caribbean countries with a thriving indigenous Carib population. We  therefore  call on the General Assembly to give full support to the adoption of this declaration by consensus.  The Commonwealth of Dominica  located as we are in the hurricane belt  in an earthquake zone and in a volcanic region  particularly welcomes the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund  which we believe will significantly enhance the capacity of the United Nations to respond more effectively to the increasing frequency of natural disasters brought about by climate change and global warming. We  the Member States  now have an obligation to contribute to the building of the Fund  while at the same time taking steps to put in place measures to combat climate change and reduce our emission of greenhouse gases. Member States must be commended for the movement in a few important areas that will contribute to a revitalized United Nations. The first relates to progress in the area of Secretariat and management reforms  which we hope will contribute to greater transparency and accountability in United Nations operations. The second is the finalization on 26 August 2006 of the new treaty protecting the rights of persons with disabilities  and I am pleased to announce that my Government is committed to signing and ratifying that treaty. We believe that that convention provides a solid basis for breaking down the discrimination directed towards people with disabilities.  The next area is the adoption by the General Assembly on 8 September 2006 of a United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Through this action  we have in a small way honoured the numerous victims of international terrorism and demonstrated our resolve to combat the scourge of terrorism wherever it exists. We must continue to work towards a counter-terrorism convention.  My country is continuing to make progress towards realization of the Millennium Development Goals  despite the many challenges with which it is confronted. In the aftermath of the devastation wreaked upon our economy by the rulings of the World Trade Organization disputes settlement mechanism  which resulted in the virtual dismantling of our banana industry  we had to undergo stringent fiscal adjustments to deal with unsustainable debt. The great sacrifices of the Dominican people resulted in modest economic growth and helped to consolidate our economic recovery. Spiralling oil prices  however  are seriously threatening the modest gains we have made. National effort is  therefore  focused on developing alternative  renewable energy sources  such as hydro  wind and geothermal.  Recent global events have not been encouraging. The collapse of the Doha Development Round further threatens to marginalize small island developing States like Dominica in the global trading system. Trade is one central element in the international agenda that can foster sustainable economic growth  reduce our dependence on declining aid and contribute to realization of the Millennium Development Goals and the development aspirations of the small vulnerable economies.  The global trading system must recognize  however  that there is no such thing as a level playing field  even among developing countries  as there are varying levels of size  vulnerability and development. There are large developing countries  there are small developing countries and there are very small developing countries. In addition  there are the least developed countries  which may be large or small. Where the very small developing countries are islands  their vulnerability is multiplied several fold. In addition to market access  therefore  small island developing States require increased development finance for trade and productive capacity enhancement combined with trade rules that are responsive to their development aspirations. In this regard  small vulnerable economies and the least developed countries urgently need a trading system that acknowledges their vulnerability and grants them the necessary special and differential treatment. This will ensure that they benefit from their participation in the global system and lead to greater equity and fairness in the process.   27 06-53615   Increasingly  South-South cooperation has become vitally important to countries like the Commonwealth of Dominica  as the developed nations retreat from fulfilling their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their GNI for development assistance. South-South cooperation from China  Cuba  Libya  Nigeria  Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela is contributing positively to our human resource development  revitalization of our infrastructure and implementation of our public sector investment programme. We believe that the developed countries can make a greater effort to assist us in realizing the commitments made under the Barbados Programme of Action and the 2005 Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. We in the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) understand the critical importance of deepening regional integration and that is why we agreed this year to move towards the CARICOM Single Market and Economy. That development  we believe  is an important pillar in maximizing regional trade and development and in minimizing the negative impact that is likely to be inflicted upon us  as small vulnerable economies  from the forces of globalization. We look forward to the support of the donor community in this important endeavour.  Good neighbourliness is an important plank in our foreign policy  and through this approach we seek to continuously build and strengthen relations with all the countries of the greater Caribbean Basin  including Cuba  the United States of America and Venezuela. We believe in harmonious and friendly relations with all our neighbours. We should not be expected to choose one over the other  but should be seen more as a bridge across the Caribbean Basin. Maritime and border disputes within our region  and particularly between CARICOM Member States and our neighbours in Central and South America  are best resolved in an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation  using the good offices of the United Nations  the Organization of American States and other forums that can bring about resolution to such disputes.  The year 2007 will mark the bicentennial of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade in the former British Empire. We anticipate a commemorative event in the General Assembly to mark this historic occasion. The Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) Group of nations will table a resolution in the General Assembly to mark the occasion and expects the support of all Member States of the United Nations in this regard.  We welcome the return to constitutional government in Haiti  the first country to declare its independence from colonialism and slavery. We commit ourselves to work closely with President René Garcia Préval and his Government in their development efforts. We also welcome the recent announcement of commitments to Haiti by the Government of the United States of $492 million over three years  and by the Government of Canada in the amount of $100 million annually. We appreciate greatly the many pledges of assistance for Haiti’s reconstruction from various bilateral and multilateral donors and wish to emphasize the necessity for these pledges to be disbursed on a timely basis to provide the Haitian Government with the capacity to bring about improvements in the physical and social infrastructure of the country and the quality of life of the people of this CARICOM member State.  The situation in Iraq  Afghanistan  Lebanon  Darfur  and the Middle East continue to occupy our attention. Regarding the unfortunate devastation caused by the war between Israel and Hizbollah  we believe that Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) is a good basis for a future peaceful relationship between Israel and Lebanon  and we urge both countries and the neighbouring States to abide by the provisions of that resolution. The Commonwealth of Dominica has stated before in this forum that the only solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the establishment of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State alongside the State of Israel  both with secure and defensible borders recognized by the international community.  The situation in Darfur is very troubling and the international community must take action now. We commend the African Union for renewing the mandate of the African Union Peacekeeping Force  and urge the Sudanese Government to reconsider its opposition to the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping force to bolster the efforts of the African Union to provide protection and security for the people of Darfur  which is a prerequisite for a lasting solution to the underlying problems giving rise to the state of conflict.  In conclusion  let me express my delegation’s wish for a successful sixty-first session under    06-53615 28  Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa’s leadership. It is our hope that the development agenda will once again assume the highest priority of the General Assembly and that we can more effectively promote peace and security  eradicate terrorism  and above all promote poverty alleviation. We must also focus on moving forward with the reform agenda of the United Nations system  including Security Council and Economic and Social Council reform. We can prevail if we act responsibly and together. Support for multilateralism and the ideals of the United Nations must remain our priority. "
"47",1970,"DNK",61,2006,"The global game has changed. Interdependence and globalization are occurring at an unprecedented speed. With globalization  the concept of national sovereignty has changed. The international order based on the nation State — established in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia — is being challenged. Non-State actors are becoming more and more influential on the global scene. Private militias and transnational criminal movements are increasingly responsible for conflicts that used to be between State actors  as well as for undermining agreements entered into and adhered to by States.  The boundaries between domestic and foreign policy are changing. Developments in one part of the world often trigger unintended actions in other parts of the world. If we look the other way when faced with conflicts and human suffering  problems will grow  they will not disappear. To meet the goals and challenges confronting the global community  we need more than ever a dynamic and proactive United Nations.  The United Nations has to proactively address the agenda set by globalization  and it must be able to change in order to effectively meet and deliver on the new challenges. It is in everybody’s interest to have an efficient United Nations. The Organization adds moral force to the international community’s actions in a globalized world. An effective United Nations can alleviate the negative effects of globalization and turn it into a positive force. All of us have to work to ensure that the necessary reform steps to be initiated.  Last September’s World Summit set an ambitious agenda for the United Nations and the General Assembly. I am pleased that we have achieved   25 06-53317  considerable results. Prominent examples include the establishment of the Human Rights Council  the Peacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency Response Fund. The two new organs represent a long overdue institutional modernization of the United Nations that  if used as intended  will help the United Nations to address new challenges. That is why Denmark has put so much effort into helping to foster the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission.  With Burundi and Sierra Leone on the agenda  the Peacebuilding Commission has chosen two nations in need  but also two nations willing to join forces with the international community in their endeavour to build their nations.  As it should  the Human Rights Council allows for closer scrutiny by the international community of domestic affairs — not because we wish to punish but because we wish to help improve. Such scrutiny is a desirable monitoring mechanism to ensure the protection of people from abuse by their own Governments. Let us avoid politicizing the work of this new body and instead  in a spirit of cooperation  ensure that the Human Rights Council is successful in meeting the objectives laid down by the General Assembly. In that context  I would also like to draw attention to the decision by the Human Rights Council to recommend to the sixty-first session of the General Assembly the adoption of the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. Work on the draft declaration has been under way for more than 20 years. It is high time that we  the Governments  approve that landmark instrument aimed at furthering the rights and aspirations of the world’s indigenous peoples.  In June  as President of the Security Council  Denmark sought to highlight the importance of strengthening international law. We picked up the torch from the 2005 World Summit by calling a special meeting on the critical role of international law in fostering stability and order in international relations (see S/PV.5474). The Security Council spoke out clearly in favour of international law  both in general terms and with regard to specific topics such as delisting with respect to sanctions. Denmark will continue to pursue those topics  and we call upon all Member States to join us.  The reform agenda is far from exhausted. The Security Council should be reformed to better reflect the world of today. Furthermore  we need to make substantial progress on mandate review and management reform during this session of the General Assembly. Otherwise  we will not be able to meet the challenges. Member States should not micromanage the United Nations  but should build a strong and fast-responding Organization to meet new challenges.   The United Nations must play a strong role in order to secure positive gains from globalization for developing countries. Denmark eagerly looks forward to the recommendations of the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence. Our aim is to enhance on the ground the efficiency and impact of United Nations development cooperation.  It is a cause for concern that we have witnessed the resurgence of the notion of respect for national sovereignty as a justification for inaction in international affairs. There is of course no denying that nation-States remain the constituent part of the international system and of this very Organization. But respect for sovereignty can never become an excuse for accepting massive human rights violations. That was the key message from the Summit last year  when heads of State pronounced their support for the notion of the responsibility to protect.  The Security Council has consistently worked to uphold the sovereignty of Lebanon since 2004. In August of this year  the Council intervened to stop the war between Hizbollah and Israel  and decided to send thousands of peacekeepers to help the Lebanese Government extent its authority to all parts of the country. We call upon all regional players to work constructively towards that goal. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) must be fully respected by all parties. Denmark is actively considering ways to promote the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006)  including by assisting the Secretary-General in his endeavours to find ways forward on the political aspects.  The war between Hizbollah and Israel proved the volatility of the Middle East. For decades  the international community has sought to address the Arab-Israeli conflict  which continues to breed hatred and fanaticism. We must support moderate forces for reform and empower them to stand up against centrifugal tendencies. We need to redouble our efforts to finally achieve a comprehensive and lasting two-State solution to that tragic conflict. It is in nobody’s    06-53317 26  interest that the instability in the Middle East continues.  The same goes for the Sudan. The Council’s decision last month to continue preparations for a United Nations peacekeeping force to relieve the African Union force and stop the senseless carnage of civilians in Darfur drew sharp criticism from the Government of the Sudan and was denounced as neo-colonialism and a violation of its sovereign rights. But  I ask  whose rights are really being violated here? Rather than the rights of the Government of the Sudan  I submit that it is the right of the population of Darfur to receive protection that is being violated. It is incumbent upon the international community to act if a Government fails to fulfil the responsibility to protect. I call upon the Government of the Sudan to work with us  not against us  in protecting the population of Darfur.   In Afghanistan the security situation continues to be of great concern. We are  individually and collectively  being tested on our commitment to assist the Afghan people on their path towards a just and prosperous future. Warlords  financed by the opium trade  threaten the democratic rights of the people. The United Nations must continue to support the remarkable transformation process undertaken by the Afghan people and their Government.  We wish to see a stronger role for the United Nations in Iraq  in order to contribute to peaceful and democratic development. A necessary precondition to improve the situation is better living conditions for all in Iraq. Needless to say  it is in our common interest to assist the Iraqi people in their struggle to reform and build their country. It must not fall victim to sectarianism and terrorism. If that happens the whole region will become destabilized.  The most serious danger associated with globalization is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Security Council reacted in unity to deplore the 4 July launch of several missiles by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We call upon Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks.   Iran has failed to respond to the demands of the Security Council. We call upon Tehran to suspend enrichment activities and accept negotiations on the generous package.  Weapons of mass destruction and terrorism represent a deadly combination. Terrorism is already in itself one of the major threats to international peace and stability. We all remember the tragedies here in the United States five years ago  as well as the terrorist attacks in London  Madrid  Amman  Bali  Saudi Arabia  Egypt and Turkey. I am very pleased that the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) has now been adopted by the General Assembly. That gives us renewed hope that we may also conclude the negotiations on a comprehensive convention this year. I call upon all States to seriously attempt to bridge the differing views that exist with regard to that very important convention  in order that we can combat the scourge of our time  terrorism.  As Chairman of the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee  Denmark is working towards the strengthening of the international fight against terrorism through improved cooperation between the Council and Member States.  Let me conclude my statement by expressing Denmark’s sincere appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts to promote a more just  prosperous and peaceful world and for his leadership of the United Nations. For almost 10 years  Kofi Annan has served in an office where expectations for action are not always matched by the requisite powers and the means to act. He has impressively carried a heavy burden through troubled times  and recently has even undertaken new challenges in the Middle East and in the world at large. His act will be a difficult one to follow. Let his heritage be that the stones he lifted do not roll back down the mountain. "
"48",2015,"DOM",61,2006,"I am greatly honoured to congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of Bahrain upon her election  the first woman from the Middle East  to preside over the work of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. She has the great responsibility to promote dialogue and harmony in the midst of the spread of conflict throughout the world. Likewise  we wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General for his ten years at the head of this Organization and for his immense efforts to promote peacekeeping  security and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.  In the interest of continuity in the pursuit of United Nations reform  so notably promoted by the Secretary-General  our country wishes to reiterate its conviction that any reform must provide for greater democratization. We recognize the unquestionable accomplishments achieved during this process  such as the creation of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Notwithstanding  reform will be incomplete if it does not include reform of the Security Council  the body specifically responsible for taking political decisions within this Organization. It is our conviction that the Security Council must be expanded to make it more diverse and participatory  with the aim of ensuring more equitable regional representation and taking into account the regional and national interests that prevail in today’s world. There is also a need for closer cooperation between the Security Council and other important United Nations bodies  such as the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.  One of the global issues of great concern to the Dominican Republic and other parts of the world is that of human security. We have observed with great consternation that there has recently been an erosion of domestic security in countries  leading to increased violence and criminality. That situation has  without a doubt  been fuelled by a combination of factors  among them drug trafficking  the illicit traffic of arms  the trafficking of persons and other criminal activities. In addressing this dramatic situation  which is driving some populations to desperation  the Dominican Republic remains vigilant in the continuous struggle and urges the international community to strengthen control and prevention mechanisms that are needed to meet these modern challenges that only increase fear and desperation among defenceless civilian populations.  Another issue of great importance for the progress and well-being of our countries is the relationship between migration and sustainable    06-52885 12  development  which constitutes the main item on the General Assembly’s agenda. We believe that the phenomenon of migration is positively linked to the cause of development. However  there is an inherent contradiction in this modern  globalized world in that we promote the free flow of merchandise  capital and services  while we restrict the free flow of human labour.  Although each State exercises its sovereign right in implementing its migration policies  it is our conviction that the asymmetry currently existing between the free flow of production inputs and the restricted flow of persons will have to cease to exist over time. According to the conservative voices in the developed world  migration is a sort of invasion from the underdeveloped countries to the most developed countries. It is also considered to be an act of revenge for the territorial expropriation that took place in the colonial era and is seen as a threat to their current way of life.  This is a fallacy. Migration is not about the poor invading the developed countries  nor is it a threat to their current way of life. Frankly speaking  migration is one of the historical means used by human beings and to which they continue to resort to in order to achieve greater well-being  liberty and justice. As it will be impossible to do away with this phenomenon  we can only seek to control it in a legal and organized fashion  in a framework of respect for the human rights and dignity of all persons. In the meantime  many people could benefit from this situation  through remittances  the creation of networks of contacts and cooperation  capacity-building in human resources  technology transfer and diverse forms of collaboration and exchange.  In another regard  the serious events that recently took place in the Middle East have filled us with alarm and consternation. They are a dramatic reminder that tensions affecting the peace of entire regions still persist. As with other conflicts  the dispute between Israel and its neighbours can be resolved only through dialogue and the good offices of the United Nations  which recently achieved the cessation of hostilities between the two disputing parties. We are confident that a definitive peace will prevail in this region and allow the development of enhanced levels of understanding  tolerance  and co-existence among its inhabitants.  The Dominican Republic maintains its interest in participating in the promotion of peacebuilding and conflict resolution. We reiterate our deep commitment to the activities and objectives of the United Nations International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW). We consider them suitable for the advancement and dignity of all the women of the world and  in particular  the women of countries such as the Dominican Republic. As the host country  we warmly appreciate the support of Member States to INSTRAW.  The Dominican Republic is deeply committed to re-establishing stability in Haiti  and we applaud the recent decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for six months. The Dominican Republic has special interest that there be an increase of international cooperation aimed at preserving the pace of the reconstruction process of this sister nation. With regard to our two countries  our warm relations are also expressed through the Dominican-Haitian Joint Commission  a forum which our Governments are reviving because we recognize it as the most appropriate mechanism for discussion and for reaching agreements on many topics of shared concern.   In conclusion  we wish to see the United Nations renew and strengthen itself with a view to playing a more active  dynamic and effective role — one that would guarantee the realization of the values and principles enshrined in the San Francisco Charter  so as to ensure that peace on Earth will become the daily form of existence among human beings.  "
"49",2062,"DZA",61,2006,"At a time when the United Nations continues on its path towards universality by welcoming a new Member State — Montenegro  with which Algeria has been involved in multi-faceted cooperation — the very basis of our institution is once again being tested by the grave developments in the situation in the Middle East  with violence directed at our brother peoples of Palestine and Lebanon. Because of their context  their scope and the breadth of their consequences at various levels  those acts of aggression — which cannot merely be seen as passing occurrences — point an accusing finger at the limitations imposed upon the authority of the United Nations when it is faced with conflict situations which run counter to its very raison d’être.  In the vast areas of the developing world  in particular throughout Muslim civilization  a silent frustration is growing and increasing before the powerlessness of the United Nations to support the most elementary human values of the Palestinian and Lebanese people.  The Middle East is without doubt the most unstable region of the world. There we see the great cruelty  flagrant denial of justice and recurrent waves of violence that are reflected in the serious deterioration of the humanitarian and security situation. This makes the prospect of establishing a just and lasting peace in the region a remote one. The Palestinian people are improperly subjected to collective punishment  and Lebanon — whose suffering is exemplified by the relentless Israeli attack against Qana — has been caught up in a murderous war  in which the Lebanese people were able to hold at bay the infernal firepower and destructive capability directed against it.  In the same geopolitical sphere  lack of security and instability persist in Iraq. The daily ransom paid in heavy human losses is submerged in a pernicious effect of habit and trivialization. The establishment of the Government of National Unity  and that Government’s decision to opt for inclusive national reconciliation are first steps in the right direction. Algeria welcomes the positive response to those developments from the main political forces in Iraq  and we believe that the best way to ensure the success of the ongoing political process — with its objective of allowing Iraq to fully recover its sovereignty in the framework of national unity and territorial integrity — would be through intensified efforts to avoid further fratricidal schism in the country along ethnic and religious fault lines.  One year ago  at the World Summit  we defined a path together towards comprehensive reform of the United Nations. By joining the consensus on adoption of a series of specific reform measures  the non-aligned countries hoped to contribute to the transformation of the United Nations into an instrument capable of   23 06-53329  addressing the new challenges and threats confronting the international community.  First of all  we have seen the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission  an innovative institutional mechanism that has long been lacking in the Organization. We saw also the establishment of the Human Rights Council  which also marks progress for the international community as it seeks to achieve universal respect for all human rights. However  a great deal remains to be done in order to attain the objectives which have been set in the reform process.   Thus  it is important that we strengthen our efforts in order to succeed at this session in achieving comprehensive agreement on pending issues  in particular reform of the Security Council. Through such comprehensive reform  the Security Council should become more representative in its membership  more democratic and more transparent in its functioning and more in harmony with the positions of the General Assembly  in order to provide greater legitimacy to its decisions and to enhance its effectiveness.  The peoples of the United Nations had hoped that the celebration of the Organization’s sixtieth anniversary would return us to the principles and purposes of the Charter  and enable us to re-draw the plans it outlined. But today’s world is full of uncertainty and too many problems still weigh upon it. It is confronted with more threats than ever — all of them equally dangerous — which must be addressed in a consistent manner in order to better determine their root causes and thus to enable the international community to act with determination to eliminate them for good.   That is true for terrorism  which continues to strike communities with its well-known horror and cruelty and without distinction as to race  sex or religion. The fight against that scourge  from which no country is safe  requires unified cooperation at both the regional and international level  using clear and complementary approaches.  Algeria  which has long suffered from terrorist violence — to which some have reacted with indifference and others with complacency — can only welcome the fact that the international community has become aware of the seriousness of the threat of terrorism upon international peace and security. It stresses the urgency of concluding a comprehensive convention against international terrorism  which should contain an unequivocal definition of that scourge and draw a distinction between the legitimate struggle of peoples against foreign occupation  on the one hand  and on the other  acts perpetrated by terrorist groups or individuals  and which would be careful not to confuse that scourge with any particular religion  civilization or geographic area.  I would like to reiterate our legitimate concern as we are faced with the deadlock of the multilateral disarmament process  and the disagreement that has emerged  here and there  on the issue of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The goal has remained the same. Disarmament must be overall and complete and under effective international control. The policy of nuclear non-proliferation must be pursued in both its horizontal and vertical dimensions and those countries that have voluntarily given up the military nuclear option have the right to expect security guarantees and free access without discrimination to nuclear technology for peaceful uses.  In the Western Sahara  the last territory which must be decolonized in Africa  the Saharan people remain deprived of their inalienable right to self-determination  as enshrined in the Charter and relevant United Nations resolutions. Just as in 1991 with the adoption of the Settlement Plan  in 2003 the international community  after the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of the peace plan proposed by Mr. James Baker  former Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara  the United Nations had the hope of seeing a just and lasting settlement to the conflict. But today we must note that no positive evolution of that conflict has taken place  because of the rejection of the peace plan by one of the two parties to the conflict and its desire to prejudge to its advantage  the final status of the territory — a status which can only be determined through a referendum on self-determination.  Algeria  which has no claims whatsoever on that territory and is not in any way involved in the conflict — which has only two parties as designated by the international community  namely  the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front — has taken note of the unanimous adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1675 (2006)  which reaffirms the right to self-determination of the Saharan people. Deeply respectful of the “Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples” as    06-53329 24  contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960  Algeria will continue to support all efforts designed to enable the Saharan people to exercise their right to self-determination with full sovereignty in conditions that are incontestably free and transparent.  In another area  the outcome of the seventh African Union Summit in Banjul shows a mixed record concerning the development of various crises and other conflicts situations on the continent  in particular in the Côte d’Ivoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the Sudan and Somalia. Serious efforts are being deployed in order to promote interaction between the United Nations and the African Union  in order to effectively deal with those situations  which have often shown themselves to be complicated and difficult.   What is more important — a culture of peace is developing throughout Africa as a result of a renewal and recovery  the foundations of which were established by African leaders of the region through the creation of the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).   In that light  it is extremely important to insure that the peaceful settlement of the crisis in Darfur  with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Sudan and in keeping with the Abuja accord  move hand in hand with harmonious action based on the good will of all  in particular of the African Union and the United Nations.  The question of development is  rightly  one of the highest priorities of the United Nations agenda  in particular following the adoption in September 2000 of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). So  too is the eradication of poverty  which weighs heavily upon the conscience of mankind. However  the gap that exists to date between the goals and the progress achieved is such that decisive efforts are essential in order to insure that Africa will achieve its goals by the year 2015. Similar great efforts are required from the developed countries to honour their commitments undertaken at the time of the Millennium Summit   the International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey  as well as the 2005 World Summit.  At the time of the sixtieth anniversary of the creation of the Organization  all of us realized that the world had profoundly changed and that it was necessary to adjust our activities to the new realities. Faced with the many challenges and structural threats of our time  the 2005 World Summit gave us a clear diagnosis and prescribed the necessary remedies. One year later — the state of the world today further stresses how acute the problems are and the urgency of solving them. It makes it crystal clear that it would be pointless to dwell on the uncertainties and imbalances  as well as the precarious situations that have become an inextricable part of the fabric of international society  unless we want to doom that society to chronic instability and insecurity.  Truthfully  the imperfect achievements and limited gains made by the international community  at a time when globalization has greatly shrunk both time and space  demand of us that we view the future with genuine resolve  concerning what has to be done  rather than resign ourselves to what merely appears possible. In that connection  there is no alternative to a truly democratic reform of the United Nations that includes the participation of all countries. There is no viable option other than a globalization based upon peace and prosperity that benefits all of humankind. "
"50",2109,"ECU",61,2006,"The twenty-first century demands that the world develop a new vision of the concept of international law and of relations among peoples and States. A year ago  Ecuador raised the need to move towards a new world order built on three bases: the economy  international law and biology. This need has become urgent. We summon the planet to establish this new triad  which must include biology.  Never before has there been so much wealth. Poverty  however  continues to grow  and hunger and misery take their toll of human lives each day. Life on Earth is deteriorating. The harmonious continuity of humanity is threatened  and the world — including the developed countries — has not been able to find an adequate answer. There are still vast areas of sub-Saharan Africa  Latin America and Asia where millions of human beings are on the brink of extinction. Vast areas continue to require international cooperation. While in Japan  Hong Kong and Iceland  life expectancy at birth exceeds 80 years  in Botswana and Lesotho it barely reaches 36 years. While in Sweden  Singapore  Denmark  Iceland and Norway  the    06-52885 20  under-five mortality rate is below 4 per 1 000 live births  in Sierra Leone  Niger and Liberia it exceeds 235 per 1 000 live births. We must guarantee greater equity in health expenditure throughout the world in order to overcome the huge gap between the few dollars per capita invested in poor countries and the thousands of dollars per capita that are invested in the developed world.  Five years have passed since the Millennium Development Goals were proclaimed  and very little has been done to achieve them. The limited compliance among the most highly developed countries to contribute 0.7 per cent of gross national income to progress in the poorest areas has had an adverse impact on this situation.  Underdevelopment is a global problem; just like the healthy continuity of our species  which is threatened by economic  political and military problems. The least developed countries lack resources to improve education and culture — a requirement for ensuring collective health. The growing burden of foreign debt prevents our people from investing in their development. Underdeveloped countries are still under the yoke of external debt service  which continues to absorb domestic savings and limits the possibilities for social and productive investment.  Far from resolving the problem  successive debt refinancing creates further links that lengthen the chain shackling development and economic progress  and it undermines the ethical foundation and the destiny of humankind. That is why Ecuador supports the initiative of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to create a group of highly indebted lower- and middle-income countries that together would work to find creative and long-term solutions.  The neediest countries are marginalized from investment in scientific research and medical discoveries.  The phenomenon of migration has taken on unprecedented dimensions. More than 200 million people are refugees  living outside their countries of origin. Migration causes families to break down and results in cultural deterioration  hampering the emergence of future healthy generations and adequate care of the elderly in conditions of dignity.  Countries must assume binding commitments on the defence of the human rights of migrants. To that end  we welcome the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development — a multidimensional event that reflects the political resolve of sending and receiving countries.  War affects the entire planet. Mortality rates increase not only because of its direct victims  but also because of the destruction of infrastructure. Ethnic and religious problems  or economic aspirations  lead to genocidal practices. World peace  respect for human rights and respect among States are the principles that led to the founding of the United Nations.  Transfixed  the world has witnessed bloodshed and brutal acts of violence against peoples as a consequence of the settlement of conflicts through the use of weapons  and of the limited ability of the international community within the United Nations to find solutions within the framework of the law.  We support the resolution adopted by the Security Council — and the efforts of the Secretary-General — to ensure a commitment by all parties involved to comply with the ceasefire and to withdraw their forces to the borders established before the last confrontation.  The international community and the highest multilateral bodies have been unable to find diplomatic means of resolving such conflicts swiftly and effectively. Thus there needs to be an improvement in the structure of these bodies  including the United Nations system itself.  The Security Council is no longer an expression of a global balance. Today  it represents only itself. For that reason  it must be reformed and democratized. It is unacceptable that  at the dawn of the third millennium  the lives of millions of human beings and of entire populations hinge on the veto of one State or another and on a unilateral geopolitical vision.  The concepts of war and peace are once again at the heart of our reflection on global security and survival. The security of the planet  of peoples  of States and of nations will be sustainable only if it is founded on health  on education  on development and on peace.  Laying the foundations of genuine peace is the greatest moral obligation of all of humankind. The alternative is growing insecurity  fuelled by poverty  illness  destitution and fear.   21 06-52885   The creation of the Peacebuilding Commission and the inception of the Human Rights Council  of which Ecuador is member  and the reforms that are being launched in the Secretariat and in the administrative bodies of the United Nations represent significant steps forward  but they still fall short.  My country  Ecuador  believes that the reform of the system includes strengthening the World Health Organization  its leadership and its fight against poverty and the environmental impact of poverty  in the promotion of local  national and regional initiatives aimed at implementing a fully decentralized global health system. That will make possible enable the development of health systems and models capable of ensuring tangible benefits for all inhabitants of the planet.  Universal health insurance is a valid strategy to guarantee access to a comprehensive health-care system among developing nations at the same level as in developed countries. That would eliminate the shameful asymmetry that is reflected in the unbalanced health statistics that differentiate the various segments of our populations.  In order to implement these and other important health programmes  considerable financial resources must be mobilized  which must flow from international cooperation  but also from developing countries and the so-called donor countries.  In this century  compliance with the Millennium Goals is State policy for the Government of Ecuador. For a multinational  pluricultural and multi-ethnic country such as Ecuador  ensuring respect for human rights means  above all  respect for the other; respect for the development of indigenous peoples  with full recognition of their diversity and of their need to be integrated into the process of modernization  while preserving their identity.  Ecuador welcomes the recent adoption by the Human Rights Council of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and fully supports its adoption by the Assembly.  We reaffirm our commitment to fight crimes of the utmost gravity  such as trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of boys and girls. This year we have strengthened our domestic legislation to punish such crimes. The Government of Ecuador has undertaken economic policy measures to recover income from petroleum operations. That will enable us to engage in sustainable and productive social investment  thus improving living conditions for underprivileged Ecuadorians. As a result of those measures  for the first time in Ecuador  funds are available for scientific and technological research to promote knowledge so that we can be masters of our own destiny.   Ecuador is committed to strengthening South-South relations. We attach great importance to regional integration  in particular through the Andean Community of Nations and the Common Market of the South  which are key actors in building the South American Community of Nations to make progress towards Latin American integration  hemispheric integration and  ultimately  a globalization that has a human face and is equitable for all.   Ecuador promotes all the conditions necessary to reach trade agreements with all countries throughout the world  based on principles that respect the preservation of sensitive areas of national production  ensure food security and protect biological diversity and genetic data — that is to say  life.   Ecuador has consistently fought narco-trafficking and related crimes. That is why we believe that we are fully entitled to ask the United States Senate to renew the Andean Trade Preference Act to encourage legal production and exports.   Ecuador endorses the principles that guided the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). We hope that the obstacles faced by the Doha round will be successfully overcome to ensure its full validity  particularly with respect to the elimination of export subsidies for agricultural products.   Our relations with Mexico  Central America and the Caribbean are particularly important. At the same time  we are seeking dynamic relationships with countries of the Pacific rim and throughout the world.  Within the framework of the South American Community of Nations  we are beginning to engage in regional meetings with Arab and African countries to strengthen political dialogue  cooperation and mutual trade. Ecuador was greatly pleased to welcome ministers for finance and related areas from Arab and South American countries in order to jointly formulate a strategy for strengthening our economic  trade and investment relationships. With regard to African    06-52885 22  nations  my country will participate at the highest level in the summit to be held in Nigeria this November.   Ecuador also attaches great importance to political coordination mechanisms such as the Group of 77 and the Non-Aligned Movement  whose summit was held recently.   To conclude  I wish to express my sincere thanks to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his outstanding work at the head of the Organization despite the enormous difficulties he was obliged to face  including those of a financial nature. The world is confident that the new Secretary-General will be able to continue that work and to implement the processes of United Nations reform  with the commitment of all its Members  particularly the most highly developed countries. "
"51",2154,"EGY",61,2006,"Madam President  allow me today to pay a special tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of our Organization  for the important role he has played over the past ten years in upholding the lofty principles and values on which this Organization was founded. During the same period  Mr. Annan dealt with many trying international situations with profound wisdom and clear vision. It is our hope that the candidate elected for this important international post during this session will display the same wisdom and vision.  The sixty-first session meets against the backdrop of a complex international situation and unfortunate international events that have uncovered many contradictions in the work of this Organization. Those contradictions require us to study in depth the extent to which the United Nations has succeeded in strengthening international understanding and consensus when dealing with the threats and challenges that face humanity. The current complex situation and recent events make it incumbent upon us to draw on past experience to strengthen the role of the Organization in achieving the noble purposes and principles for which it was founded.  The negotiations preceding the adoption of the 2005 Summit Outcome Document and the subsequent negotiations on its implementation have made it clear that the visions of the North and the South with regard to the future of the United Nations and the nature of its   41 06-53005  role in the current and coming phases have become more divergent than before. That was manifest in a number of attitudes that have left visible marks on the international environment.  There is a widening gap between  on the one hand  those who pay the larger share of the budget of the Organization and believe that their contributions entitle them to a larger say in the conduct of its work  and on the other hand the developing countries  which pay their fair share as established by the methodology and criteria adopted by the General Assembly and believe that the Organization must remain the international forum of democracy  equality and good governance on the international level  as embodied in the principle of “one State  one vote”.  Some States  with increasing insistence  believe that the Security Council must hold the fate of the Organization in its hands  taking precedence over its other main organs. Those States are robbing the others of most of their competencies and deal with them in any way they see fit  without oversight  even if that leads to the failure of the Council to discharge its responsibilities to prevent the killing of the innocent or the perpetration of crimes of genocide and other crimes against humanity.   This insistence by a small number of States runs counter to the view of the majority of Member States  which believe that the General Assembly is the inclusive democratic forum that brings the Members of the Organization together. It is the Assembly that mandated the Council to bear the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Assembly alone has the right of oversight and review of the work of all the organs of the Organization. Indeed  the Assembly has the right to withdraw the prerogatives of the Security Council  should it fail to discharge its charter-mandated responsibilities or if the narrow political interests of one of the parties to a conflict prevent the Council from fulfilling its task.  This is a time when the international arena has witnessed a growing tendency to misuse official development assistance (ODA) by imposing conditions on the national priorities of developing countries without any regard to the agreements reached in the relevant United Nations conferences and summits. At the same time  the overwhelming majority continues to believe that development is a human right and that development assistance  along with the transfer of technology  is an obligation for developed countries.  Last year was the sixtieth anniversary of the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Astonishingly  some States continue to believe that their might and dominance are based on their — and their allies’ — continued possession of nuclear arsenals. These States believe in the need to exercise strict control and supervision of other States and to apply restrictions on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. At the same time  the great majority of Member States believe that their commitment under the Treaty on the  Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) not to produce nuclear weapons was made on the basis of a corresponding commitment by the nuclear-weapons States to eliminate nuclear weapons under international supervision within a specific time frame and to achieve the universality of the Treaty. Not only does the maintenance of the existing nuclear arsenals jeopardize the credibility of the NPT  it also threatens humanity with total destruction and annihilation.  Our peoples have a keen interest in the achievement of a larger measure of democracy  human rights and political reform. However  we now can see that some seek to impose these concepts by military force  based on their assumption that their principles  values and cultures are superior and stronger and thus worthy of being imposed on others. At the same time  the overwhelming majority believe that democracy and human rights are based on culture-specific values and standards that emanate from their respective societies. They simply cannot be imposed from outside.  Notwithstanding the increase in the number of victims of terrorist operations  there is an increased tendency to deal with terrorism through military force alone  while ignoring its root causes. Some have made it their mission to rid the world of the evils of terrorism as they themselves define it. They ignore the international collective work to conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism and to implement effectively the General Assembly Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in a manner that strikes a balance between the respective roles of the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Last  but not least  the negotiations on the reform of the Organization have proven that some believe that the international collective security regime was established to enable those who posses the military    06-53005 42  might to impose political settlements under international protection. While the great majority believes that the lessons of history  most recently in Lebanon  have proven that military might cannot and will not impose a political settlement. Such settlements must be reached through negotiations alone.  The aforementioned are some of the main elements that set our positions farther apart during the past year. We must take these elements as a basis for determining the premise of our work during this session. We must develop a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the performance of our Organization. Together  we should chart the course aimed at upholding the values of democracy  justice and respect for law in international relations. We must move resolutely towards the consolidation of those values in the international community  in view of the fact that they constitute the real  solid foundations of international peace and security.  With the same constructive spirit that prevailed in our work last year  together with a balanced mixture of realism and ambition  and without the imposition of impractical time frames or the acceptance of temporary measures  we must proceed towards the achievement of further reform and the strengthening of the effectiveness of the United Nations. We must commit to preserving both the principle of consensus and the intergovernmental character of the Organization.  Together  we must work to increase the ability of the collective security regime to deal swiftly with international problems. We must stand up to the arrogance of power of some so that we can protect the rights and future of other countries and peoples. We must also face resolutely any attempts to impose temporary solutions through unilateral actions or military solutions that might result in transient victories that lack justice and a comprehensive vision. Such actions only scratch the surface of the problems without delving into the root causes. They lead to the exacerbation of problems by fanning the flames of hatred and rejection. This  in turn  feeds terrorism and extremism and leads those who despair of the justice of the international system to rebel against the will of the international community.  Despite Egypt’s repeated warnings against following the path of escalation and confrontation  the huge loss of life and property incurred as a result of the war between Israel and Lebanon has gone beyond all limits. Lebanon has suffered the total devastation of its infrastructure and the indiscriminate killing of hundreds of innocent civilians  including children  as the result of actions that contravene the United Nations Charter and the basic rules of international law and relevant international humanitarian law. And  despite the fact that the Israeli war against Lebanon caused untold devastation  it has proven that military might  however great  will never be able to impose a political solution. It has also proven that the solution lies in ending the occupation and in negotiating a just political settlement that will eliminate the feelings of enmity and replace them with relations of cooperation and peaceful coexistence.  Undoubtedly  Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  after having been amended to take into consideration the Arab point of view  thanks to the efforts of the Arab delegation mandated by the League of Arab States to New York  is a step in the right direction. However  this step will remain incomplete and will not enjoy the success required unless it deals with the core of the problem in the region — namely  the Arab Israeli conflict.  The Arab-Israeli conflict has squandered the resources and lives of the people of the Middle East for many decades. In it  political  historical and religious dimensions have fermented into a combustible mix that carries the seeds of a conflagration that could go beyond the region and reflect negatively on stability and relations between the various cultures and faiths in the world. Hence the importance for all of us  citizens of the region and members of the international community  to act in concert to reach an immediate  just and comprehensive solution to this conflict.  In its endeavours to achieve comprehensive peace between the Arab world and Israel  Egypt precedes from a realistic vision of the events on the ground. In this context  Egypt is exerting efforts to improve the security situation between the Palestinians and the Israelis through direct engagement with both parties  with the aim of calming the situation  putting an end to all acts of violence  killing and destruction and encouraging confidence-building measures between the Palestinians and the Israelis aimed at resuming dialogue and negotiations. At the same time  Egypt seeks to resume progress on the three tracks of the settlement of the Arab Israeli conflict. This is the main objective of the peace process  which has regrettably been stalled for years. The deterioration in the security   43 06-53005  situation must not make us lose sight of that objective. Experience has proven time and again that the success of security measures will remain limited and fragile if they are not made part of a wider political framework that would ensure the basic rights of the parties and encourage them to make the difficult decisions necessary for the improvement of the security situation.  The Quartet has drawn up a road map for peace. It was accepted by the parties and the States of the region. It was endorsed by resolution 1515 (2003) of the Security Council. It was hoped that it would constitute the political framework to which I referred earlier. However  this did not happen  for reasons that I will not list here. Yet  the road map remains a cornerstone for the achievement of peace in the region  since it establishes the principles of peaceful co-existence between Israel and Palestine and determines the general parameters of the final settlement between Israel  Palestine  Syria and Lebanon — namely  an end to the occupation that started in 1967  implementation of the international resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict  and implementation of the Arab peace initiative that would ensure security  peace and recognition for Israel by its Arab neighbours in return for Israel’s ending its occupation of the Arab territories and working out acceptable solutions for other pending issues. There is now a need to build upon this cornerstone in order to create an effective political framework that would move the parties towards the objective desired by the international community as a whole — namely  the establishment of a comprehensive peace that would put an end to occupation and strife in this part of the world.  Egypt has closely followed the developments in the Darfur crisis since its inception. It is one of the troop- contributing countries to the African Union observer mission in Darfur. Egypt participated actively in the Abuja talks and has provided humanitarian assistance to the people of Darfur.  There is no doubt that the international community bears a major share of the responsibility for reaching a swift and just solution to that problem. In our opinion  efforts must focus on creating conditions conducive to the success of the Darfur Peace Agreement as the political framework agreed upon by the main parties. That will require the launching and strengthening of the Darfur-Darfur dialogue in order to create a consensus on the Peace Agreement and to convince the parties that have not yet signed it to do so. In addition  there is a need to encourage the Sudanese Government to carry out its commitments on the development and reconstruction of the Darfur region.  If the United Nations is to continue to play the role entrusted to it  we must display a sense of collective responsibility based on a strong resolve to make the Organization an inclusive framework for common international efforts to deal promptly and effectively with regional and global issues and problems.  The call to disseminate democratic practices and good governance among the States of the world will be heeded only if coupled with the clear commitment of all States to applying those concepts in a multilateral framework and at the international level. It will be valid only if accompanied by a reaffirmation of the principles of partnership  the sharing of burdens and responsibilities  equality of rights and duties  and  above all  participation on an equal footing in defining options and in decision-making at the international level.  Let us work together to strengthen the principles of democracy in an international multilateral setting. Let us make dialogue and mutual respect the language of our discourse. Let us give lofty human ideals and the common good precedence over narrow selfish interests. Let us cast aside our differences and be real partners.  In conclusion  allow me to convey our sincere congratulations to you  Madam  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident that  as the first Arab woman to assume that high position  you will meet with resounding success. In that respect  allow us also to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  for his skilful leadership of our work.  "
"52",2178,"ERI",61,2006,"On behalf of the Government and people of the State of Eritrea  I avail myself of this opportunity to extend to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  and to the Government and people of the Kingdom of Bahrain  my sincere congratulations on her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I also wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  who presided over the sixtieth session of the Assembly  for his dedication and skilful leadership during the past year.  For reasons of brevity  I do not wish to dwell on generic themes of global economic development  United Nations reforms and other issues of interest that have been addressed comprehensively by many speakers with whom we share similar views. I shall instead focus on cardinal issues of peace and security that remain of paramount importance to my country and the Horn of Africa region as a whole.  In this respect  allow me  Sir  to bring to the attention of this Assembly  for the umpteenth time  Ethiopia’s reckless flouting of international law that is threatening peace and security in our region. It is painful for my Government to harp on the same theme at every Assembly session for the past four years. But these are the sad facts of a perilous reality imposed on my country. In the event  we are duty bound to press for and exhaust all legal processes to stave off dangerous consequences before it is too late.  As the Assembly is aware  demarcation of the boundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia remains stalled  more than four years after the legal award  owing to Ethiopia’s rejection of the final and binding arbitration decision. Ethiopia’s conduct is contrary to the terms and conditions of the Algiers Peace Agreement. Indeed  article 4.15 of the Agreement stipulates as follows:   “The parties agree that the delimitation and demarcation determinations of the Commission shall be final and binding. Each Party shall respect the border so determined  as well as the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the other party”.  It must be stressed that there is no equivocation or ambiguity in the general provisions of this Agreement. Yet  Ethiopia has violated the core of the Algiers Peace Agreement with impunity. And  it has continued to occupy  by force  the sovereign territory of a United Nations Member State for the past four    06-53341 18  years  in violation of that Agreement and Article 2  paragraph 4  of the United Nations Charter.  How and why did this happen?  To single out Ethiopia as the primary and only culprit would be missing the forest for the woods. The fact is that Ethiopia has neither the power nor the political skill to defy international law for even a single day  let alone for four long years. If it has done so for the past four years  it is simply because its unlawful conduct has been  and continues to be  encouraged and supported by certain Powers in the Security Council.  This poignant state of affairs is best exemplified by the following three instances. First  when three years ago  in September 2003  Ethiopia’s Prime Minister sent an ominous letter to the Security Council announcing his Government’s blatant rejection of the Boundary Commission decision and calling for a “new mechanism” outside the Commission to overrule the legal award  the Secretary-General and the Council chose to accommodate Ethiopia’s unlawful conduct. This happened in spite of the fact that the Council is the main guarantor of the Algiers Peace Agreement and has treaty obligations to maintain the integrity of the legal decision. It must be recalled that the Council is explicitly empowered  by article 14 of the same agreement  to invoke Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to ensure compliance by the parties.  As it happened  the Secretary-General and the Council opted for the wrong path and appointed a Special Envoy  in contravention of the legal agreement. The demarcation process has thus been stymied for the past four years at huge financial cost to the international community and inestimable cost in terms of lost opportunity and heightened tension for the peoples of Eritrea and Ethiopia.  Secondly  when this Special Envoy scheme proved unworkable  the United States Government employed its full diplomatic clout to unlawfully alter and modify the legal Award under the rubric of a “new initiative”. This time around  the United States dropped all pretensions of influencing the demarcation process from without  through an external envoy wearing a United Nations mantle. The current plan consists of directly planting a senior expert as an adjunct to the Boundary Commission and bestowing on him wide powers to alter the decision in the process of demarcation.  Washington’s package further envisages creating a new and political appellate body — outside the Boundary Commission — to accommodate Ethiopia’s additional requests in case of dissatisfaction with the “alterations” that would be implemented through the services of the expert. This United States “diplomatic” scheme  which in effect renders fundamental tenets of the Algiers Peace Agreement null and void  has been tailored to fully address Ethiopia’s request for an extrajudicial mechanism when it rejected the Boundary Commission decision in September 2003.  From the foregoing  one can only surmise that Ethiopia’s original rejection of the award must have been tacitly supported by Washington from the outset. The United States Government has even resorted to a series of measures against my Government with the apparent purpose of furthering this aim. In this connection  I wish to refer particularly to the seizure of financial and other assets of our Embassy in Washington by the United States Homeland Security Department in contravention of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and to avail myself of this occasion to lodge a complaint on behalf of my Government and to solicit the support of the international community for redress and restitution.  Thirdly  the semi-annual and other periodic reports of the Secretariat to the Security Council have invariably tended to downplay Ethiopia’s violation of the Algiers Peace Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations. These reports have often tended to apportion equal blame to both parties without differentiation and  particularly in the last two years  to impugn Eritrea alone. In this regard  Security Council resolution 1640 (2005)  which the Security Council adopted in December last year  went so far as to threaten imposing punitive measures against Eritrea  ostensibly for curbing the freedom of movement of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE)  while overlooking Ethiopia’s refusal to accept unconditionally the final and binding decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC).   This unlawful conduct by Ethiopia is indeed threatening to unravel the peace process as a whole. We can also cite various instances in which the United Nations Secretariat went out of its way to downplay unacceptable excesses and infringements of Eritrea’s sovereignty by UNMEE staff and to blame my Government instead of taking appropriate remedial measures. Incidentally  whether the huge annual   19 06-53341  financial outlays for the sustenance of UNMEE are really justified and provide value for money spent remains a critical matter that requires thorough scrutiny and auditing.  For us  these concerted unwarranted acts belie an overarching theme. The solemn pledges that we have heard on this podium from leaders of major Powers on upholding international justice and the rule of law  like the collective commitments to prevent and resolve conflicts and avoid humanitarian disasters  ring hollow at the altar of reality. When the chips are down  major Powers  and especially the United States  continue to pursue their perceived narrow interests at the expense of regional peace and security and the sovereign rights of nations and peoples.  Be this as it may  my Government is determined not to allow the legal process to be derailed through various subtle subterfuges. Let me recall that Eritrea’s right of independence was compromised by the United Nations in the 1950s — during the period of African decolonization — to serve the interests of the United States. Half a century later  we shall not allow any encroachment of our territorial integrity.   In addition  as my Government underlined during the last meeting of the Boundary Commission  first  the award that is “final and binding” in accordance with the Algiers Peace Agreement should not be tampered with under any circumstances. In this connection  Ethiopia’s acceptance of the decision must be ascertained publicly and unequivocally. Secondly  the details and modalities of demarcation must be worked out in an environment that is free from political interference  unlawful and compounding mechanisms  and loopholes susceptible to distortion.  Allow me now to briefly dwell on the dangerous developments that are unfolding in Somalia and the muddled interpretations  both deliberate and innocent  that have gained currency in recent months. We must recognize that the current crisis in Somalia derives from multifaceted and cumulative underlying causes that have been in place for the past 15 years. Collective or individual initiatives that will be taken to promote enduring peace and stability in Somalia must accordingly address the following parameters if they are to bear fruit.  First  the daunting problem in Somalia is essentially an internal political problem that must be resolved through negotiations among Somali political forces themselves. In this spirit  my Government welcomes the efforts of the Sudanese Government to facilitate talks among Somali political forces.  Secondly  the portrayal of recent developments in Somalia in terms of the global war on terrorism is factually untenable and politically imprudent. The overarching national cause of the Somali people should not be reduced to or lumped together with this singular concern.  Thirdly  any external military intervention will further polarize the political realities of Somalia and induce greater conflagration. Ethiopia’s military intervention  under whatever guise or justification  is particularly dangerous both for reasons of historical animosity and because of the events of the past few years. It must be understood that there is no consensus within the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on the modalities  timing and nature of deploying foreign forces  although the matter was comprehensively discussed at ministerial meetings for the purposes of contingency planning only. We find the African Union’s recent call for deployment of an 8 000-strong peacekeeping force in the absence of a robust framework of peace unwise and fraught with unnecessary complications. Its practicality is also questionable in view of the financial and other challenges that the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) is grappling with in that country.  Fourthly  a recent call by some forces for a selective lifting of the United Nations embargo on arms is unbalanced  misguided and fraught with the potential for dangerous consequences. Indeed  a selective lifting can only imperil the political process of reconciliation in Somalia and a durable political settlement there. Accordingly  appropriate adjustments to the arms embargo in Somalia can be contemplated only when there is irreversible progress in the political arrangements giving rise to national institutions that have credible legitimacy and popular support.  Fifthly  the challenges for promoting lasting peace and stability in Somalia are formidable. They will be complicated if different actors work  or are seen to be working  at cross purposes. Closer coordination and consultation among all interested players must be cultivated and structured.  Finally  the current situation in Somalia is raising the spectre of territorial claims and disputes between Somalia and its neighbours. Territorial disputes and    06-53341 20  claims can only be settled by strict adherence to the sanctity of colonial boundaries.  Let me conclude by urging caution and prudence in the international efforts to help resolve the problems in the Sudan. The truth is that the high price of hasty and ill-advised policies will ultimately be borne by the people of the Sudan and the region as a whole. The complexities of the situation must therefore be gauged carefully  and all international efforts must be harnessed to promote a robust peace package that will bring about a lasting solution. Focus on short-term arrangements without an overall peace framework will only postpone and complicate a lasting solution. "
"53",2224,"ESP",61,2006,"It is indeed a great pleasure to address this General Assembly on the International Day of Peace  in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. The Government of Spain calls for a vigorous United Nations system that can guarantee international peace and security in a world that is global  complex and full of uncertainty.   I should like to congratulate our President on her election as the first Arab woman to lead the Assembly — a task in which  I predict  she will have great success. She can count on the full commitment and cooperation of Spain. I also wish to express my gratitude and congratulations to Mr. Jan Eliasson  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden and President of the General Assembly at its most recent session. His leadership and negotiating skills contributed to the adoption of far-reaching political agreements aimed at the implementation of the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1).   Understanding and cooperation among countries will clear up the unanswered questions of the twenty-first century — a century characterized by globalization  which has spread throughout the world  pervading areas of daily life and causing transformations in the power of States and the system of international relations.  In their analysis of that complex and uncertain reality  political theoreticians sometimes turn to scientific knowledge  but its formulations fail to provide concrete measures to deal effectively with the political and institutional challenges of the twenty-first century. New times call for new politics that cannot be influenced in any way by fear  distrust or suspicion in the international community. The factors and events that shape today’s international relations must not distract or hold back the innovative spirit of political action.  Today  we know that technology alone does not lead to progress with regard to security and social and economic growth. Globalization has great individual and collective benefits. It is a mixture of contradictory trends — hope and despair  humanism and barbarity — in which we find serious imbalances that must be addressed with political courage and confidence.  This new era has not resolved old conflicts that are eroding international peace and security. The situation in the Middle East is the present-day version of a historical conflict that has challenged the international community. The adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and the cessation of hostilities open the way for hope that the necessary conditions will be created for a lasting peace. We have already endured more than five decades of suffering and despair. We have already endured five decades of appealing in this forum for a definitive solution. We have endured five decades of the international community’s impotence.  From this rostrum  I call for a coalition for peace. This is not about rediscovering the Mediterranean; it is about commitment. We must say “yes” to the creation of a democratic  viable and peaceful Palestinian State that lives in peace and security with the State of Israel; “yes” to full support for President Mahmoud Abbas; “yes” to ending the violence and terror against Israel; “yes” to reactivating the Madrid Process  which began 15 years ago; “yes” to a global peace that includes Syria and Lebanon; and  finally  “yes” to an end to this tragedy.  The only possible way to find a solution is political and diplomatic action  not military action. We must rebuild a dynamic of negotiation to permanently eradicate violence from this region  which is bleeding to death as a result of misunderstanding and pain.   39 06-53005   My Government hopes that all actors involved in the region commit themselves to implementing resolution 1701 (2006) and to the tasks in southern Lebanon that have been entrusted to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon  in which Spanish troops are participating. We must give peace and dialogue another chance.  From the eastern Mediterranean  I now turn to the western Mediterranean. Spain pays particular attention to its neighbourly relations with the Maghreb  a region with regard to which we maintain an active and comprehensive policy that strengthens our friendship and cooperation. That is why we attach importance to the relaunching of the process of building a united Maghreb.  To accelerate the pace of that project  we will need to find a negotiated and effective solution to the conflict in Western Sahara  which has lasted for more than 30 years and urgently calls for an atmosphere conducive to breaking the current deadlock. The international community must create such an atmosphere to ensure a just and lasting political agreement that respects the principle of self-determination  within the United Nations framework.  The will to engage in dialogue and compromise could clear up this old conflict  as was the case with Gibraltar. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Tripartite Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar  which met last Monday in Cordoba  has already adopted its first agreements  which reflect the spirit of the relevant United Nations resolutions. Those agreements in no way mean that my Government renounces its sovereignty over Gibraltar.  Relations with Ibero-America are a constant priority of the Government of Spain in its foreign policy. We are committed to promoting the cohesion  growth and visibility of the Ibero-American community  with which we maintain historic ties and share new strategies and objectives. The Ibero-American Secretariat  which is participating here for the first time as an observer  strengthens our community through dialogue and coordination. The forthcoming summit to be held in Uruguay will assess ongoing activities and propose measures to begin anew the social  economic  cultural and political progress demanded by the civil societies of the Ibero-American community.  The President returned to the Chair.  Cooperation and understanding also guide our trans-Atlantic relations and  in a very special way  our relations with the United States. In a constructive spirit  we discuss concerns and long-term projects that strengthen the international community.  As multilateral actors  we know that many of our difficulties and problems will not be resolved through voluntarism or national action. Our action must be on a global scale if we are to effectively address them in all their complexity — particularly the new challenges facing the international community that hinder the promotion of a more just and equitable globalization.   A sense of political responsibility leads us to resolve urgent global problems such as security and terrorism  to fight hunger and poverty and to manage migratory flows. Through the coordination of the United Nations  the world must promote the causes of sustainable development  security and human rights. We cannot have security without development  there can be no development without security  and we will not attain those objectives if human rights are not respected.  We cannot accept terrorism  regardless of its origin. Our acceptance would transform it into terror and would unleash a spiral of fear in which freedoms would suffer. We must not let down our guard against terrorism; neither must we let down our guard against the erosion of freedoms. The Government of Spain welcomes the adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which does not overlook victims and their families.  Situations of extreme poverty and humanitarian catastrophes are inconceivable at the beginning of the twenty-first century. We must deepen our sincere commitment to the Millennium Development Goals and to the fight against hunger and poverty in order to alleviate the uncertainty  hardship and despair that affect millions of citizens throughout the world.   The traditional areas of Spanish action have been broadened and reinforced through the progressive consolidation of an advanced cooperation policy. Spain has increased the quality and quantity of its Official Development Assistance (ODA)  which will reach 0.5 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008. Spain’s contribution to international organizations and trust funds has increased this year by more than 400 per cent.    06-53005 40   Spain’s development aid has been expanded in the Mediterranean countries and the African continent  where planning has played an important role. The plan for Africa has required a major effort of cooperation and commitment to deal with dramatic situations of poverty and sickness  which jeopardize the well-being of African societies.  Future programs  such as the one proposed by President Wade of Senegal  merit all our consideration and support. Poverty has brought us a new global challenge  namely  the management of migration flows  since hunger and need know no borders. Inequalities in the distribution of wealth  unemployment  the lack of future prospects  political instability  inadequate respect for human rights and intolerable life conditions push more than 200 million people in the whole world to migrate. The demographic impacts of these flows are perceived not just in countries of origin  but also those of transit and destination. Therefore  immigration is one of the greatest challenges of the twenty-first century and Spain is on the frontline. We must confront it in all its aspects  both internal and external  with measures for development assistance and border controls.  Migrations  exchanges and communications technologies have given birth to a multicultural society that is not without tensions. This emerging reality stimulates the appearance of challenges that demand a critical analysis in order to build solid bridges between East and West.  The initiative of the Alliance of Civilizations  sponsored by Spain and Turkey  belongs today to the international community and the United Nations and seeks to provide answers to these challenges. The management of cultural relations can only be achieved from the perspective of security  education  promotion of culture and interreligious dialogue. This respect amongst the different cultures and creeds must encourage the reduction of frictions that could inspire violence and terror. The cartoon crisis and the effects and wrong interpretations of the words of His Holiness the Pope urgently demand the implementation of the Alliance of Civilizations.  The twenty-first century will be the time when we are called upon to resolve old conflicts and confront new global challenges effectively. For that  a reform is needed in the United Nations. The Government of Spain is satisfied with the reform process in the areas of peace and security  development and human rights. The Peacebuilding Commission  the Human Rights Council  the United Nations Democracy Fund  the Global Strategy against Terrorism and the Central Emergency Relief Fund are new instruments that have a bearing on the challenges facing the international community.  Allow me to conclude with a few verses of the universal Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca  from his book “Poet in New York”    “If hope is extinguished and the Babel of incomprehension begins  what torch will light the paths of the Earth?” Let us not give up the dream of peace. Let us work together to achieve it. "
"54",2250,"EST",61,2006,"I begin by congratulating Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalaifa on her assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly. We have full confidence in her and wish her every success. I should also like to praise Foreign Minister Jan Eliasson for his effective leadership during the Assembly’s sixtieth session  which achieved truly noteworthy results.   I also warmly welcome the Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United Nations.  The United Nations confronts huge tasks. There has already been remarkable progress in certain reform areas  such as the establishment of the Human Rights Council  the Central Emergency Response Fund and the Peacebuilding Commission. We also attach great importance to the launching of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  which calls for enhanced United Nations measures to deal with terrorism and for the better coordination of such efforts.  Estonia is strongly committed to promoting peace and security throughout the world. We have been following developments in the Middle East with concern and compassion. The recent events have once again demonstrated that  in addition to the need to secure lasting peace  there is a need for prompt action and generous contributions from the international community to resolve humanitarian crises. Estonia has not been a bystander. We have been responding to the dire needs of the people in Lebanon and have provided assistance to the Iraqi people so that they can rebuild their country.   Estonia continues to actively support the United Nations in promoting peace and security  just as we support the Organization’s important role in international development. We remain convinced that the United Nations is an answer to both current and future threats and divisions in the world. As we fully subscribe to the comprehensive statement delivered by the President of Finland on behalf of the European Union  let me briefly highlight some aspects of global partnership to which we attach great value.  One of the main aims of the Millennium Development Goals is to develop a global partnership for development. That encompasses a commitment to good governance and the efficient functioning of democratic institutions  as well as to fully respecting human rights and the rule of law for the sustainability of development efforts. As was emphasized in the Final Document of the 2005 World Summit  no country can tackle today’s complex challenges alone. While all nations bear the principal responsibility for their own development  their individual efforts should be supported by concrete global actions and programmes. Partnership is truly a central element in everything we do.  Joint global action is most urgently needed when a disaster hits a country or a whole region. For a timely and efficient response from the international community  a well-coordinated and properly resourced global disaster relief system is required. Estonia gives increasingly high priority to the coordination of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance at the global level  and finds it important to further strengthen the United Nations humanitarian response capabilities. The first year of the Central Emergency Response Fund has been a promising step towards a balanced and more responsive international humanitarian system  although many challenges remain. We are committed to further increasing our financial contribution to the United Nations humanitarian system disaster relief assistance.   In this regard  it is important to always ensure that disaster relief and all other development activities   29 06-53609  favour environmentally sustainable solutions. Environmental sustainability is an urgent  but at the same time long-term  task which demands common action. Estonia attaches great importance to the need for coordination and coherence in the field of environment-related activities  and supports the creation of a more coherent institutional framework within the United Nations.  The fulfilment of the internationally agreed development goals calls for the engagement of not only Governments and intergovernmental bodies; the commitments made at major conferences cannot be implemented without cooperation with local institutions  the private sector and non-governmental organizations. Our experience clearly demonstrates that non-governmental organizations can play a crucial role in effective development cooperation. In many cases civil society institutions are much more efficient in establishing dynamic working relationships with non-governmental organizations of partner countries than government institutions. The cooperation with non-governmental organizations has been remarkably advantageous in such sectors as sustainable development and information and communication technology  as well as e-governance.  This brings us to another area of cooperation —using information and communication technology to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Since my country has been notably successful in employing new information and communication technologies  as well as in carrying out extensive reforms  we shall continue to increase our input into overall development in this field.   There is also a need to reinvigorate and reform the United Nations. Estonia is ready to contribute to the best of its ability to the development of a comprehensive information and communication technologies strategy for the whole United Nations structure. All these issues — information technology  sustainable development and humanitarian and disaster relief — are also on the agenda of the Second Committee  which will be chaired by the Permanent Representative of Estonia during this sixty-first session. We will do our utmost there to see to the effective promotion of the matters I have mentioned — and  of course  all other crucial matters before the Committee.  We must remain strongly committed to respect for the rule of law and our rights and dignity as human beings. Indeed  if we want human rights to form one of the three main pillars of the United Nations  alongside security and development  it is essential to implement both the letter and spirit of resolution 60/251. We expect the Human Rights Council to be strengthened and become an authoritative institution  and we expect human rights issues to gain equal standing with other major items on the United Nations agenda. This first year of the existence of the Human Rights Council is a year of transition and capacity-building. Estonia’s vision encompasses the establishment of an operational body reinforced with special procedures and a new efficient and universal mechanism  which monitors individual countries  with non-governmental organizations as essential partners.  We should also make sure that the rights of indigenous peoples remain an integral part of human rights and continue to be a matter of substance for the Human Rights Council. Adopting the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples during the current session is of great importance for the millions of indigenous peoples worldwide. It is crucial that it be adopted at a plenary meeting of the General Assembly this year. Its implementation could be a major step towards eliminating the widespread human rights violations suffered by many indigenous peoples. The Human Rights Council could also host a forum for dialogue where the representatives of indigenous peoples  States and a special rapporteur could discuss the issues enshrined in the Declaration.  Another new instrument that needs to be adopted by the General Assembly and implemented by States as soon as possible is the draft convention on enforced disappearances — a recurrent phenomenon that must be fought against. It is essential that it be adopted at the current session so that States can start to sign and ratify it at the beginning of next year in Paris.  The Millennium Development Goals are also intended to promote gender equality and empower women worldwide. That includes  of course  the United Nations. Estonia shares the vision that the role of women within the decision-making system of the United Nations should be increased. As the General Assembly is to decide on the next Secretary-General this year  we support the proposal to consider Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga as a candidate. Thus the President of Latvia could be the first woman to head    06-53609 30  the United Nations in its 60 years of existence. Our commitment must be reflected in our decisions. The time has come to have more representatives from central and eastern Europe in high-ranking posts in the United Nations. I believe we are ready to make history.  Before finishing  I should like to express my deepest respect for the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. We appreciate his dedication and personal determination in addressing the enormous challenges of the twenty-first century and shaping our common future. During nearly 10 years of service he has held mankind’s universal values high and led the United Nations with true vision. "
"55",2296,"ETH",61,2006,"Allow me to extend to you  Madam President  our sincere congratulations on your assumption of the Presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session and to express our full confidence in your ability to guide the session successfully.  Let me also express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his leadership during the sixtieth session.  My delegation’s appreciation also goes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his selfless   15 06-53958  commitment and devotion to the objectives of the United Nations  in general  and for his contributions  through various initiatives  to the efforts of reforming our Organization and for his dedication to their practical implementation  in particular.  In our view  one of the key accomplishments of the international community in recent years is the agreement on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is imperative that we all commit to building stronger partnerships to achieve these noble goals and targets. In this regard  we are cognizant of the fact that each country is responsible for its development. It should also be equally recognized that  for those countries at the early stage of economic development  there is a need for stronger support from the international community if they are to meet the MDGs.   For low-income countries  there is nothing more important than a partnership that is predictable  consistent and based on mutual obligations defined in advance. The long-awaited opening up of international trade  especially through the elimination of agricultural subsidies  should also be expedited.   On our part  we have intensified our efforts to improve the socio-economic conditions of Ethiopia. Today  in the decade and a half since the dictatorship was swept out of our country  our socio-economic progress has been substantial. We have succeeded in channelling our limited resources into capacity-building and infrastructure programmes serving the entire country. We have opened up new universities and technical institutions of higher learning  expanded primary health-care services and built roads  airports  power plants  transmission and telecommunication facilities and services  among others. As attractive opportunities have become more apparent  domestic and foreign investment has grown.  In this regard  I would like to highlight some of the achievements recorded so far. In the past three fiscal years  the Ethiopian economy has grown by an average of 9.5 per cent annually. Over the same period  our export trade has grown by 28.5 per cent per annum. Our primary school enrolment ratio has increased to 89 per cent from a mere 30 per cent in the early 1990s. In order to strengthen our capacity for development  we are building 13 public universities. In two to three years  when these universities are fully operational  the total annual intake of public universities would increase from the current 30 000 to 150 000 students. Similar results have also been achieved in the health sector  where the Government is equally determined to enable rural people in Ethiopia to have adequate access to basic health care by 2010.  Benefiting from the encouraging results of the first five year plan and the experience gained in its implementation  the second five year plan  namely  the Programme for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty  was drawn up on a much wider and enhanced scale. The main objective of this latest plan is to alleviate poverty by ensuring food security and meeting the MDGs.  As it carries out its development agenda  Ethiopia strongly believes that the prevalence of peace and security in the country and its region is an absolute necessity. For this reason  Ethiopia will not allow its dispute with Eritrea to distract it from its focus on development  although that has been the main objective of Eritrea since the conflict began eight years ago. For the last four years  Eritrea has been blaming Ethiopia for its own aggression against us and for the current stalemate in the peace and demarcation process. In fact  now  the whole world is being blamed for Eritrea’s own failure and for its inability to behave like a normal State.  For the benefit of this Assembly  it would be fitting to place the conflict in the proper context and perspective for a better appreciation of the current impasse in the peace process. It should be recalled that Eritrea launched an unprovoked attack against Ethiopia in May 1998 in blatant disregard of international law  thereby igniting the war and leading to the present crisis. In this respect  I wish to draw the Assembly’s attention to the decision of the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission regarding issues of liability in the war between the two countries.   In its decision  the Commission set forth  inter alia  the following conclusions. First  Eritrea is liable for committing unprovoked aggression against Ethiopia. The Commission stated that Eritrea violated Article 2  paragraph 4  of the Charter of the United Nations on 12 May 1998 and the days immediately following when it resorted to armed force in attacking and occupying areas peacefully administered by Ethiopia. Secondly  Eritrea is liable to compensate Ethiopia for the damages caused by that violation of international law. Thirdly  the Commission rejected    06-53958 16  Eritrea’s argument that its recourse to force was justified  because some of the territory question was territory to which Eritrea had a claim.  The Commission’s decision shows not only Eritrea’s warped understanding of international law but unambiguously confirms that Eritrea’s illegal act constituted aggression.  Before Eritrea launched its aggression and during the war and after  Ethiopia has shown its strong desire and willingness to resolve the conflict with Eritrea by peaceful means. It should be recalled that  in order to create conditions for a sustainable peace and in order to re-establish all-around cooperation between the two countries  Ethiopia presented a five-point peace plan  which the international community  including the Security Council  had welcomed. However  the proposal was flatly rejected by Eritrea.   We have also cooperated fully with the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy. Furthermore  Ethiopia has welcomed the peace initiative presented by the Witnesses to the Algiers Agreement  which is supported by the Security Council and made the following proposals. The current impasse should be resolved with the assistance of a neutral facilitator in the demarcation process. Freedom of operations by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) should be restored  together with the sanctity of the Temporary Security Zone. The threat or use of force should be eliminated. There should be normalization of relations between the two countries. In this connection  I would like to assure the international community that we shall continue to persevere in our search for a lasting peace.  Ethiopia has on various occasions expressed its readiness to demarcate the boundary  through dialogue  in accordance with the decision of the Boundary Commission  and has attended in good faith the meetings convened by the Commission. It has also reaffirmed its readiness to normalize its relations with Eritrea. Ethiopia has done so not because it is desperate for closer relations with Eritrea  but rather because normalization is critical for durable peace. But Eritrea will have none of this. Why? Because Eritrea’s strategic goal is neither peace nor a peaceful common boundary. What it wants is interminable boundary problems with Ethiopia.   The latest report of the Secretary-General on Ethiopia and Eritrea  of 19 September (S/2006/749)  and the report of the Boundary Commission annexed to it clearly indicate that the Commission’s June and August meetings were cancelled because Eritrea refused to attend. Eritrea has also issued ultimatums as a condition for its cooperation with the Boundary Commission. I wish to underline here that Eritrea has no reason to be frustrated by the lack of the speedy implementation of demarcation. Eritrea is the reason why the boundary between the two countries has still not been demarcated.  Eritrea’s illegal and anti-peace stance is not limited to issuing ultimatums. It has blatantly violated the Algiers Agreement by threatening the use of force and has violated the integrity of the Temporary Security Zone by deploying its armed forces there. It has tightened its blatant restrictions on the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and its personnel. The Secretary-General has reported time and again that Eritrea has not only prohibited the Mission from carrying out its mandated tasks  but also engaged in a series of arrests and detentions of its personnel. Those are naked violations of the Algiers Agreement  Security Council resolutions and the Charter.  The way forward to break the current impasse in the peace process is very clear. Eritrea needs to abide by the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Algiers Agreement  withdraw its armed forces from the Temporary Security Zone and restore the Zone’s integrity and UNMEE’s freedom of operation. It must demonstrate its compliance with article 1 of the December 2000 Agreement by renouncing the use of force to resolve the dispute between the two countries. It should cooperate with the international community in its efforts aimed at resolving the dispute peacefully and through dialogue. Only when Eritrea decides to cooperate with those legal measures will we be able to begin to resolve the dispute in accordance with international law.   Eritrea should behave as a responsible State and resolve any dispute through diplomatic means. Eritrea must understand that that is its only option. Its continued  dangerous tactic of using brinkmanship against many actors in the international community is not acceptable.  Ethiopia shares a border of more than 2 000 kilometres with neighbouring Somalia and is home to about 3.5 million Ethiopian Somalis. It is in the   17 06-53958  interests of Ethiopia that peace  stability and national harmony prevail in that country. It is precisely for that reason that we have spared no effort over the past 15 years — working together with partners in the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union (AU) — to help the Somalis to achieve peace and national reconciliation.   The Transitional Federal Government of Somalia is the product of the efforts made by Somalis themselves  with the support of IGAD countries  the AU and the international community in general. That Government is now facing a major challenge from those who have ambitions that have nothing to do with Somalia but everything to do with chaos  instability and terror. The international community would do itself a great disservice if it failed to appreciate the implications of what is currently happening in Somalia and did not respond in an appropriate manner.   Somalia is being dragged into the abyss by those who are using religion as a cover to deny the people of Somalia peace and the opportunity to revive a nation that has been in a state of collapse for 15 years now  making it possible for those who have no interest in peace and stability to thrive. The latest opportunistic move in this regard was made by Eritrea  but it is bound to fail. IGAD and the AU are asking for political and diplomatic support so that the Transitional Federal Government can be in a position to contain those who are the agents not of love  but of disharmony — not of peace  but of war. That is not too much to ask of the international community.   Only when the Transitional Federal Government is in a position to protect itself from the internal and external enemies of peace will dialogue provide a solution to the crisis in Somalia — a crisis that the extremists within the Islamic Courts Union hope will engulf the whole region. It is precisely for that reason that the partial lifting of the arms embargo is so critical. There are those who want to wish away the danger in Somalia. There are  on the other hand  those who want to benefit from the danger. It is obvious that the latter group  to which Eritrea belongs  is taking advantage of the naivety of the former.  There should be no doubt that Ethiopia will continue to be a pillar of peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. That is Ethiopia’s vocation  whether with respect to the problem in Somalia or in connection with the difficulty we have in ensuring that Eritrea chooses the peaceful path. Resort to force is never a basis for sustainable peace. That is the philosophy that underpins our policy towards Eritrea and towards the crisis in Somalia. There is no better guarantee for peace and stability than the nurturing of mutual confidence and trust  regardless of differences in outlook or in political or other values. This also explains Ethiopia’s legendary commitment to the United Nations and to its principles and purposes. As I conclude  therefore  I would like to reaffirm Ethiopia’s devotion to the United Nations and to the values of interdependence  which the Organization embodies. "
"56",2342,"FIN",61,2006,"Madam President  on behalf of the European Union  I have the honour to address the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. The acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania; the candidate countries Turkey  Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; the countries of the Stabilization and Association Process and potential candidates Albania  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Montenegro  Serbia; and also Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova  align themselves with this statement.  Let me start by congratulating you  Madam President  upon your assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly. I also wish to express our appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  whose input has been crucial to the United Nations reform process. We are confident that under   15 06-52731  your wise leadership  Madam President  this session will turn out to be successful.  The European Union is deeply committed to the United Nations and to its comprehensive agenda promoting peace and security  sustainable development  human rights and fundamental freedoms. We want to create a more peaceful  prosperous and democratic world. The European Union continues its close and loyal cooperation with the world Organization. Recent events in different parts of the world have proved once again that  61 years after its establishment  an effective United Nations is needed more than ever.  Contrary to our shared ideals  the realities of war and violence have not passed away into history. Conflicts and terrorism continue to destroy the social and economic progress for which we are all striving. The recent tragic events that occurred in Lebanon  Israel and the Palestinian territories have again demonstrated the need to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Sustainable peace in the Middle East and security for the people living there can be achieved only through a commitment to a peace process that leads to a viable independent Palestinian State living in peace with a secure Israel. That remains our goal. The European Union is determined to participate actively in the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) in order to help consolidate the ceasefire and reach a long-term solution based on the terms contained in the resolution.  The European Union is strongly committed to respect of international humanitarian law  including the protection of civilians and humanitarian personnel during conflict. We therefore condemn the deaths of hundreds of civilians in Lebanon and Israel in the recent conflict. We welcome the outcome of the Stockholm International Donor Conferences on the Humanitarian Situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and on Lebanon. The European Union has responded swiftly and generously to both humanitarian appeals.  In the Middle East  we have demonstrated our continued  strong commitment to the United Nations. Peacekeepers from European Union countries are already deployed in the area and will form the backbone of the new United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) operation.  On this occasion  I want to pay tribute to the memory of the United Nations military observers and other personnel who recently fell victim to the war in southern Lebanon.  The European Union will continue active engagement in United Nations peacekeeping operations in the future. We see wide scope for further complementary and combined efforts with the United Nations as well as with other regional entities.  In sub-Saharan Africa  many peace agreements have been brokered with the help of the United Nations  the African Union and the European Union. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  the European Union remains greatly involved in assisting in the completion of the electoral process through a major financial contribution and the decisive support of the European Union military operation.  Unfortunately  in Darfur  the humanitarian and security situation is deteriorating. The European Union welcomes the recent Security Council resolution on the United Nations-led peacekeeping operation in the Sudan  and we strongly urge the Sudanese Government to give its consent to the deployment of the United Nations operation.  Peacebuilding is an integral part of the broad security concept. The newly established Peacebuilding Commission brings its own and much-needed contribution to United Nations work for peace and security. The European Union will work actively to ensure that this new body will have a strong and dynamic role in the United Nations system. Gender aspect is important in this context. We also welcome the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund to enhance the capability of the international community to respond to urgent humanitarian needs.  The events of the past year show that terrorism continues to threaten international peace and security. This threat can be effectively addressed through broad-based cooperation within the framework of the United Nations. The European Union welcomes the agreement on a global counter-terrorism strategy as an important instrument and expression of international solidarity in the fight against terrorism. The European Union urges United Nations Member States to build on this achievement and to intensify their efforts to reach a speedy consensus on a United Nations comprehensive counter-terrorism convention. We underline the importance of prevention and of conducting the fight    06-52731 16  against terrorism in accordance with human rights  refugee law and international humanitarian law.  We consider it important that this session of the General Assembly should mark progress in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation. Concrete action is needed on small arms and light weapons at the national  regional and global levels. The European Union will continue to push for a legally binding treaty on trade in all conventional weapons.  Effective multilateralism is crucial in facing the growing threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Security Council has a central role in addressing those threats. In this regard  the European Union welcomes the unanimous adoption of resolution 1695 (2006) on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We look forward to its effective implementation  and we strongly urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to implement fully the requirements of this resolution.  The European Union also welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006) and calls on Iran to respond positively and swiftly to the demands of the international community in implementing this resolution  in particular by suspending its enrichment activities in accordance with that resolution. This would pave the way for negotiations on a comprehensive agreement aimed at restoring confidence that the Iranian nuclear programme serves exclusively peaceful purposes. We welcome the current exploratory talks aimed to facilitate the opening of the negotiations. An increasingly important element in the promotion of global peace and security is the need to foster tolerance  mutual understanding and respect. In this regard  the European Union has already expressed its strong support for the Alliance of Civilizations initiative.  Development builds peace. The United Nations and its Member States have created effective common goals for economic  social and environmental development. We must fulfil our common commitment to the global partnership for development with all stakeholders and implement all the Millennium Development Goals and other jointly agreed development targets in the time agreed on by Member States. In our view  every country has control over and primary responsibility for its own development.  The social dimension of globalization  including the importance of decent work for all  deserves special attention in the work of the United Nations. Ensuring decent work is not only about economic and social development and individual rights and standards. It is also very much a factor that contributes to the social and political stability of countries and regions.  We have seen positive development also in Africa. However sub-Saharan Africa as a whole is not on track to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Therefore  the European Union has decided to give 50 per cent of its increase in aid to Africa. We are willing to strengthen the strategic partnership with Africa by developing a joint strategy.  We also need to improve aid effectiveness and donor practices. The European Union is fully committed to implementation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and calls on all other donors to do the same. In addition  the international community must deliver real gains for poor countries on trade. Trade can be a strong catalyst for economic growth and poverty reduction. Thus trade is a key element to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  The negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda must be resumed  as their successful outcome will deliver substantial development benefits to developing countries. We urge quick implementation of the aid-for-trade commitments of December 2005.  The European Union welcomes the outcome of the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries held in New York this week. We are pleased that from 2001 onwards economic growth in the least developed countries (LDCs) as a group has almost reached the 7 per cent target. As the providers of the greatest net official development aid  we note with satisfaction the overall increase in official development assistance from donor countries  especially to LDCs.  Ensuring sustainable development is an urgent task. Environmental sustainability underpins long-term development and the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals. Addressing climate change and biodiversity loss are integral parts of achieving sustainable development. For this purpose  the Montreal Action Plan on climate change agreed last year needs to be pushed forward urgently.   17 06-52731   The Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence is about to finalize its work. The European Union looks forward to studying the Panel’s recommendations  which could give an urgently needed global response  especially at the country level. This should be done in close cooperation with other multilateral stakeholders and the developing countries themselves.  The European Union looks forward to continuing cooperation in the field of migration and development after last week’s High-level Dialogue. Migration is an integral part of the development agenda  and development is an important element in migration policies.  The European Union is committed to strengthening and mainstreaming human rights within the United Nations system. One of the major accomplishments of the United Nations has been the comprehensive framework of international human rights law. It sets out clear standards by which all States are measured. With a view to strengthening that framework  we attach great importance to the adoption of new instruments on enforced disappearances  the rights of indigenous peoples and the rights of persons with disabilities during the present session of the General Assembly.  The newly established Human Rights Council has the potential to significantly strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world. The European Union wants to ensure that it lives up to that potential and that it soon plays a strong and dynamic role in the United Nations system. The Union has high expectations for the second regular session of the Council  which began yesterday.  The EU is also committed to ending impunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community. We strongly support the International Criminal Court (ICC) and call upon all States that are not yet party to the Rome Statute of the ICC to ratify or accede to it without delay.  The EU will continue to promote the rule of law both at the national level and in international relations. In Iraq  upholding the rule of law is a key challenge. The Union is working closely together with the United Nations and other partners to assist the Iraqi Government in that field.  The EU wishes to see this world Organization function in a more effective  transparent and accountable way. The EU recognizes the need to reform the main United Nations bodies  among them the General Assembly  the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council. Management reform  as well as the mandates review  will be high on our agenda when we start our work this autumn. We need to continue our collective efforts through consensual decision-making. After all  United Nations reform will benefit the entire membership of the Organization.  Before I conclude  let me pay tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. For nearly 10 years  he has shown leadership and vision in his work to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter  as well as courage in the much-needed transformation of our world Organization. He has put a human face on the United Nations  both inside and outside the Organization. I wish him all the best. "
"57",2386,"FJI",61,2006,"I extend to you  Madam  the congratulations and best wishes of the Government and the people of the Fiji Islands. The General Assembly is to be commended for accepting your candidature to become the third woman to assume the post of President of the Assembly. That recognizes the critical role that women play in the development of humanity in our global village. We assure you of the support of my Government during your tenure.   We also extend our gratitude to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his tireless efforts in the United Nations reform process  to which he has applied his personal skills and knowledge. While much is still to be resolved  his contributions thus far to the reform process have started the ball rolling. It is up to us to maintain the momentum.  Fiji  its Government and its people wish to honour and express our appreciation to the outgoing Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan. His tireless efforts to promote peace and reconciliation in the world are well recognized. Ghana should be justly proud of its son. As a nation of the developing world  we are just as proud that he has been able to project our hopes — most prominently  in the development agenda of the Organization. We respect his achievements in leading the United Nations during his tenure of office. His service to peoples around the world  and the patience  courage and determination that he has demonstrated daily in facing the world  despite the barbs and criticisms thrown his way  are commendable. We ask him to accept our deepest gratitude and profound appreciation for all that he has done. We extend best wishes for the future to him and to his family.  On this occasion  following our successful general elections held in May of this year  I am pleased to be able to report to the Assembly that all international observers who attended the holding of the general elections in Fiji have concluded that the result was democratic and a fair reflection of the popular will of the people.   The rebuilding of our nation after the disaster that struck us in 2000 is going very well indeed. It was strengthened following the formation of the multiparty Government in accordance with the requirements of our Constitution. We now have a Cabinet comprising ministers drawn from the majority Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) Party and the Fiji Labour Party  as the party that qualified to be invited to be represented in Cabinet. We also have ministers drawn from the independent members of our elected House of Representatives. This means that  for the first time in its history  Fiji has a cabinet that is truly representative of its multi-ethnic communities.  Ministers from the two major races in the country and those from the minority groups are working well together in collaborative and consultative decision-making. We are united by the common purpose of taking our country forward  for the benefit of every citizen.  Mr. Muñoz (Chile)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  This multi-ethnic arrangement for good governance has received overwhelming approval and support from all our communities. It has given our country reasons to be optimistic. People from all races now feel more confident and secure about their future. We believe that forming a multi-ethnic Government that is representative of our different communities  and making it work  is the approach that has eluded us for a long time  but one which will ensure long-term peace and stability in Fiji. That new form of inclusive Government is also underpinning our drive for continued improvements in Fiji’s economic performance.  The plea from Fiji is for the United Nations Member countries to strengthen their joint resolve to   5 06-53615  oppose terrorism everywhere in the world. Fiji is committed to a world in which peace and prosperity are the cornerstones of all societies and communities. We consider it an honour to serve the cause of peace under the banners of the United Nations and other peacekeeping arrangements  including that under the Pacific Islands Forum.   Where there are potential internal crises and disorder  we support the Secretary-General’s concept of conflict prevention. However  where the United Nations mandates intervention for peace  we are ready to contribute. Peacekeeping personnel from Fiji are working in Iraq  Kosovo  Liberia  the Sinai  the Solomon Islands  the Sudan and Timor-Leste. We would like to thank the United Nations and all those countries that have assisted Fiji in honouring its commitment to international peace and security. We welcome the intention of other countries to assist us in that matter. We do so with humility  knowing that there is more peace to keep and to build in the world today  and that we have acquired competence to offer to humanity.  Peace and security initiatives have undergone a number of reviews recently to benefit peacekeeping operations. Fiji notes the creation of the peace stabilization force in Lebanon and the consultative process that preceded it as an example of an existing organization’s being tailored to suit a given situation. We should not be afraid to make changes for the better. The best practices derived from Bougainville and the Solomon Islands are examples that can be utilized elsewhere.  The Peacebuilding Commission was established primarily to ensure that countries that have emerged from conflict do not regress to their status quo ante. Fiji commends that initiative and appeals for everyone’s support. I welcome the support given to Fiji as an inaugural member of the Peacebuilding Commission.  We in the Pacific remain committed to ensuring that our region remains one of permanent peace and stability. Next month  Fiji will host the meeting of the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum. The finalization of the Pacific Plan will be the main focus of the meeting. The Plan provides a framework for cooperation and mutual assistance in development  good governance and long-term peace and security. We commend those countries from outside our region that have pledged to work and to assist us in the implementation of the Plan.  The Pacific Islands Forum leaders welcomed their summit meetings earlier this year with China  Japan and France. We commend them for their development support and their leadership in promoting lasting peace in the region. We maintain that those initiatives ought to be sustained and can be ensured by engaging all parties in constructive dialogue.  The United Nations is renowned for addressing and finding resolutions for the problems of the small and marginalized. Fiji is a small island developing State with a highly vulnerable economy. Our economy is open and is over 70 per cent dependent on export trade to earn foreign exchange to meet its development needs.  We find that the multilateral trading rules emanating from the World Trade Organization (WTO) are not fair or equitable  given our development status  geography and size. WTO proposals that have tended towards a one-size-fits-all approach have not fully benefited from an honest and creative application of the special and differential treatment clauses of the WTO. They have not effectively addressed the multiplicity of problems we are facing. They serve only the interests of countries that are developed  big and already established traders globally and  of course  are already well off. The fact that those proposals are formulated with little regard for our concerns has manifested itself in widening disparity  greater marginalization and worsening global poverty.  However  we do not advocate the removal of the multilateral trading arrangement. We just need to make it better. The suspension of the WTO talks on the Doha Development Agenda has further deepened our concerns regarding the need for the multilateral trading rules to show some flexibility so that the development concerns of countries like Fiji can be addressed in the current round of negotiations. We call on the membership of the United Nations to work towards an early resumption of the suspended WTO talks. There is far too much at stake for all of us  and especially for the small islands developing States like Fiji.  We acknowledge the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments in the promotion of human rights. We note that they are concerned primarily with protecting the rights of individuals. Fiji  like other Pacific Islands    06-53615 6  indigenous communities  welcomes the decision to bring the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples to this Assembly for discussion and adoption. That instrument is vitally important to the recognition and acceptance of the right of indigenous peoples to self-determination and of their right to survival as ethnically and culturally distinct peoples.  On the international convention on the protection and promotion of the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities  Fiji  like others  has recognized the special needs of persons with disabilities and has already enacted the relevant legislation and subsequently established the Fiji National Council of Disabled Persons. A national policy on disability for 2006-2016  a requirement of the act  is currently being finalized. Fiji strongly supports the international convention and would be in favour of its adoption.  Fiji acknowledges the vital role women play in development. To ensure women’s active participation in all facets of development  the monitoring of the rights of women contained in the Beijing Platform of Action has to be reinforced. One effective way to do so is to ensure that domestic policies and legislation are in place to drive gender mainstreaming. That must be a priority target for us all.  Improving world security must be accompanied by appropriate reforms in our Organization. A goal of the current reform of the United Nations is the need to ensure that the voices of small and vulnerable countries like Fiji are given equal treatment in the membership of this global body.  One of the goals of the United Nations reforms is to achieve democratization. Without that  it will remain an Organization driven by sectarian interests  where might is right and moral and ethical considerations fall by the wayside. We must not be deterred from the momentous task we have set for ourselves. The outcome of our concerted and committed effort in those reforms will be a just and stronger Organization  better prepared to address the world’s multiplicity of challenges.  A lot has been achieved since we last met in plenary. New challenges have emerged. However  there are still far too many people whose needs and voices are still crying out to be heard. The United Nations remains a beacon of hope for them. Those cries ought to be listened to and people empowered so that they can firmly and confidently take charge of their own destiny. We must all undertake to assist and participate in the work of the United Nations  commensurate  of course  with our respective size and economic standing. "
"58",2433,"FRA",61,2006,"Lebanon has again been set ablaze by war  a further manifestation of the interminable conflict in the Middle East whose tragedies have  for 60 years now  punctuated the life of the United Nations.  By endlessly deferring its settlement  this confrontation has become the epicentre of international instability  the main source of incomprehension between the different worlds and an easy alibi for all forms of terrorism.  This situation is not a foregone conclusion. With Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  the United Nations is shouldering its responsibilities. The unanimous adoption of this resolution has brought the fighting to an end. France  Europe and Asia have contributed to the strengthening of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  But the fire is still smouldering. It is now up to all the parties to work towards the consolidation of peace and the recovery of Lebanon.  It is now up to Israel to complete the withdrawal of its forces. It is up to the Lebanese Government to affirm its sovereignty throughout its territory. And it is up to the countries in the region to cooperate fully in order to ensure the success of resolution 1701 (2006)  to cooperate with the United Nations.  In this highly sensitive region where divides meet  the status quo has become unbearable. Because the conflict in the Middle East is a threat to global peace and security  the world has no option but to be the guarantor of peace. Let us tread off the beaten track of habit. Let us define a global strategy the key to which is an Israeli-Palestinian settlement.  The parameters for that settlement are well-known  namely  the secure coexistence of two viable States  as has already been widely accepted by both peoples; safe and recognized borders; and a fair solution for refugees and for Jerusalem. All that still stands between Israelis and Palestinians and the peace to which they aspire is the deep-seated  mutual distrust of two peoples shattered by history and reeling from their sufferings and ordeals. Let us now stop extremists from laying down the law! Let us help peoples and leaders bold enough to seek peace! Like  before them  Sadat and Begin  Rabin and Arafat! Before this Assembly  I call on the world to commit itself to restoring the conditions for confidence.  The Quartet should meet shortly to start preparing an international conference. I propose that the conference define in advance the guarantees that we are prepared to provide to the parties as soon as they reach an agreement. I also propose that the conference pave the way for a new future in the Middle East through a regional framework for collective security  economic integration and dialogue among cultures.  Building peace means fighting terrorism. It means preventing proliferation. It means shouldering the “responsibility to protect” that we enshrined here last year.  International legality must prevail over the threats of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the crisis with Iran  confidence has been impaired by the existence of hidden programmes. We have extended ambitious offers of cooperation to that major country    21 06-52731  provided it restores confidence by suspending its contentious activities. Dialogue must prevail. Let us talk in order to enter into negotiations.  Given the seriousness of what is at stake  the international community must stand firm and united. We do not aim to call regimes into question. We aim to ensure security in accordance with international law and with due regard for the sovereignty of all countries.  The “responsibility to protect” — that was what we affirmed here. In Darfur  millions of people are threatened. A crime against humanity looms. Bloodshed and turmoil are about to convulse the very heart of Africa again.  France entreats the international community to ward off a further humanitarian catastrophe. I solemnly call on Sudan to accept the United Nations peace mission without delay. I call on the International Criminal Court to bring to justice those responsible for these crimes.  The time has come for the immense continent of Africa  with its wealth of peoples and vibrant youth  which has embarked on the road to growth and reform  to find  at long last  a destiny worthy of it and of the cradle of humanity it represents. Humanity must be united and there must be solidarity among its diverse peoples. Humanity needs  more than ever  a strong and respected United Nations  the irreplaceable tool for shared sovereignty and responsibility.  It is here that universal and sacred human rights must be defended and protected. With the new Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court  the United Nations returns to this primary vocation. Let us not disappoint the hopes of all those who love freedom and justice.  At a time when the world’s wealth is increasing as never before  the separation between the rich and poor is becoming intolerable. From its inception  the United Nations has stood for the moral imperatives of fairness and solidarity. For this reason France wishes to submit to the United Nations the idea of innovative development financing mechanisms such as the international solidarity levy on airplane tickets  a modern  pragmatic and experimental response to the need to fight poverty and pandemics. In this spirit we will be launching the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) initiative this afternoon. Let us overcome selfishness and dogmatism and give the generous idea of a world united for human progress a chance.  Finally  we all know that uncontrolled human activity is bringing about a sort of slow collective suicide. Disaster can only be averted if nations can come together to support jointly agreed commitments. Let us create a United Nations for the environment  as the expression of the world’s ecological conscience and the premier forum in which we take common action for future generations. France will host an international conference next year to bring together all those who want to make progress on this project  which is crucial to the future of the planet.  For 10 years now  a man has held high the torch of the United Nations and our universal values. Today  I wish to pay Kofi Annan the solemn and merited honour of our profound admiration  of our respect and of our recognition.  In a few weeks’ time  we will appoint a new Secretary-General  who will be faced with immense challenges. He will be able to count on the support of France  on its unswerving commitment to serving peace and justice  fraternity and progress. "
"59",2458,"FSM",61,2006,"I am honoured and grateful to address the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  and in so doing I join other Members in congratulating you  Madam  on your historic assumption of the presidency of this body.   5 06-53323  Let me assure you of my country’s full support. We are confident that under your leadership  the Organization will be steered safely through the challenges ahead. I would also like to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his dedication and stewardship of the Organization during the past year.  Just recently  the Pacific island countries lost one of its leaders. The Federated States of Micronesia is deeply saddened by the passing of King Tupou IV of the Kingdom of Tonga. We express our profound condolences to the people and the leaders of Tonga during their period of national mourning and wish them well in their transition to a new leadership.  We are keenly aware of the remaining awesome task of implementing measures to reform the Organization. We are nonetheless encouraged by the significant achievements made so far since the adoption of the Outcome Document of the World Summit last year. The United Nations has made great strides  for instance in constituting the Human Rights Council  in launching the Peacebuilding Commission and in adopting the resolution on implementing international development goals.  Reform of the Security Council should remain a high-priority agenda item. My country would like to reiterate its position as expressed in previous years. We support a restructured Security Council that reflects the current realities of international society. For the Council to be effective and its work meaningful  its working methods should be improved and its membership  both permanent and non-permanent  expanded. We must give new impetus to the reform process and seek  with an open mind  new ways to achieve the institutional reform of the United Nations.  The small island developing States in the Pacific such as my country  recognized as among the most vulnerable  stand to benefit from an efficient and relevant United Nations. It is for that reason that we place high hopes on the relevant reforms. We hope that such reforms will facilitate our achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other internationally recognized commitments  which  if left to our own devices  we cannot reach  even with the best of intentions and efforts.  Thus  we are pleased with and grateful for the decision to establish additional United Nations offices in our Pacific region  including in my country. Taken within the context of the overall reform of the Organization  the presence of those offices is mutually beneficial to the United Nations and to our peoples in many ways  including through effective coordination in the delivery of much-needed assistance and services.  My country  with a large exclusive economic zone  attaches great importance to the sustainable development and conservation of our marine resources and ecosystem. Consistent with that priority  we have joined forces with some of our neighbouring States in calling for an immediate moratorium and a total ban on deep bottom trawl fishing. The Organization must not close its eyes to activities that result in commercial gain for only a few at the expense of the integrity of the ecosystem that supports the livelihood of our people  especially those living in areas that are widely recognized as vulnerable. We appeal to the international community to mobilize support to put an end to bottom trawl fishing and other activities that are ecologically destructive and unfriendly to the marine ecosystem.  It is well established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other highly respected scientific organizations that the Earth’s climate is adversely changing due to our carbon economy and the emission of greenhouse gases. Within this decade alone  we have witnessed unprecedented destruction caused by extreme weather events. The increasing magnitude  intensity and frequency of typhoons  hurricanes and other natural disasters  including the unprecedented melting and disappearance of glaciers  are directly linked to human activities. This obviously calls for a more robust post-Kyoto regime.  As an island nation composed mostly of low-lying small islands with large coastal areas  the Federated States of Micronesia is vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change. Exposed to the effects of extreme weather events  our livelihood and traditions as an island people — in fact  our whole civilization — are under greater threat than ever before.  The sad irony is that those of us who contribute little to the causes of climate change and sea-level rise are the first in line to suffer the consequences. In the face of that reality  Micronesia will continue to speak out for concerted global action to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change  taking into consideration the principle of common but differentiated responsibility.    06-53323 6   While adaptation measures require national actions  the “polluters pay” principle should apply. Therefore  those who pollute should underwrite the costs of adaptation  particularly for small island developing States.  Sustainable development remains a top priority for small island developing States such as Micronesia  but it cannot be achieved by us alone. Our development still requires official development assistance from bilateral and multilateral donor partners alike. But official development assistance on its own is not sufficient. Ongoing propositions for active foreign direct investment and effective development partnerships  among others  should be translated into concrete action  as they are critical components of sustainable development.  The small island developing States continue to pin their hopes on the Mauritius Strategy as a blueprint for their sustainable development. But what good is the Strategy if the support necessary to implement it is not forthcoming? The international community must provide that support  which would include facilitation and improvement of access to existing resources and  where appropriate  allocation of dedicated financial resources. For the Mauritius Strategy to be effective and meaningful  it must be mainstreamed into all United Nations processes  including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process.  In addition to the Mauritius Strategy  we support the principles of the Information Society and the Community of Democracies as vital to our national progress. In particular  we seek help in the formulation of our national plan on information and communication technologies and in access to broadband connectivity  which we believe will help overcome the obstacles to our development that result from the geographical configuration of our island country.  Dependency on fossil fuel is an obstacle to our sustainable development. To mitigate that obstacle and prevent the perpetuation of this carbon economy  my Government has prioritized renewable energy as the way forward. I therefore reiterate the call made by many small island developing States  including my own  for accelerated efforts in the development  utilization and distribution of renewable energy technologies to small island developing States. We will continue to look to the international community  including our development partners  to help ensure that such technologies are transferred and put in place effectively.  Terrorism affects all countries  large and small  rich and poor. Micronesia condemns  in the strongest terms  terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The taking of innocent life is unambiguously unjustifiable  regardless of one’s grievances.  We therefore call once again on the United Nations to do everything in its power to prevent terrorism and to mitigate its root causes. While we are doing our best to uphold our responsibilities and obligations under the United Nations counter-terrorism resolutions  we need the assistance of the international community to more effectively implement and carry on the fight against this scourge.  In that spirit  we would like to commend the efforts that resulted in the recent ceasefire in Lebanon. We hope that the ceasefire will lead to a lasting peace for the Israeli and Lebanese peoples. We also hope that  by building on that momentum  the conflict between Israel and Palestine will be resolved. The people of Israel have the right to live within secure  recognized borders  free from the fear of terrorism. The Palestinian people have the right to have their own State and to coexist peacefully with their neighbours.  Micronesia is concerned about the threats to regional stability and international peace and security posed by nuclear proliferation. We urge the international community to continue its efforts to address that problem.  In closing  I would like to pay tribute to our outgoing Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his distinguished leadership and his decades of dedicated service to the Organization. My country expresses to him our gratitude and best wishes. "
"60",2501,"GAB",61,2006,"Madam President  I should like at the outset sincerely to congratulate you on your well-deserved election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your election represents not only a mark of considerable recognition for the Kingdom of Bahrain  which has tirelessly worked to promote the purposes and principles of the United Nations  but also  in personal terms  the culmination of your long legal and diplomatic career.  Above and beyond the usual courtesies  I should like to encourage you  Madam  and to assure you of our full readiness to cooperate to ensure the success of your lofty mission.  I should like also to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson for the talent  dedication and perseverance with which he guided our work throughout the sixtieth session. I should like in particular to acknowledge him for his determination in leading the negotiations that achieved considerable progress in implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the 2005 World Summit.  Lastly  I should like to convey to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  our deep admiration for the wisdom and courage he has consistently shown in discharging his difficult mandate  and in particular for the ambitious measures he initiated throughout his two terms of office to adapt the United Nations to current realities.  At a time when his tenure as Secretary-General is coming to an end and many observers will be reviewing and assessing his accomplishments  I should like  for may part  to pay a well-deserved tribute to him for having provided us with a clear vision of the work of the United Nations in terms of the three pillars of international peace and security  development and the promotion of human rights worldwide.  The consensus adoption of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1) was an unequivocal recognition by our leaders of the General Assembly’s central role as the chief deliberative  policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations. I welcome the fact that since the Summit  most of the important recommendations of the Outcome Document have already been implemented as part of the United Nations reform process.  Indeed  following the difficult negotiations  the sixtieth session of the General Assembly established two important bodies — the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council — both of which  as we know  have been operational since June. In addition  the Central Emergency Response Fund was established  and a number of major resolutions were adopted. I am thinking in particular about resolution   9 06-53329  60/42  on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel; the resolution on development; and  most recently  resolution 60/288  on the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  During the present session  bolstered by that major progress  we must continue our efforts to complete the reform process. For example  we must intensify our efforts to conclude the negotiations aimed at adopting a comprehensive convention against international terrorism and at reforming the Secretariat  the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council.  The theme you proposed for this year’s general debate  Madam President  “Implementing a global partnership for development”  is very timely. That theme  which echoes Goal 8 of the Millennium Development Goals  will undoubtedly make it possible to follow up and implement the decisions emanating from the Monterrey Consensus and reaffirmed at the September 2005 World Summit.   It is extremely urgent that all development partners honour all their commitments. Our appeal to them takes fully into account the primary responsibility of all States to plan and carry out their own development. It also addresses the many constraints hampering the developing countries  in particular the impact of HIV/AIDS  malaria and other infectious diseases on their populations and economies.   Therefore  I cannot fail to welcome the fact that  in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (resolution 60/262)  adopted on 2 June 2006 at the end of the High-level Meeting devoted to follow-up on the implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS  the international community stressed the special situation of sub-Saharan Africa and recognized the efforts made by African Governments to fight the pandemic.  Gabon  for its part  has undertaken ambitious initiatives ranging from awareness raising to the implementation of action plans such as the multisectoral strategic plan to fight AIDS. The Gabonese head of State and his spouse  Ms. Edith Lucie Bongo Ondimba  are personally involved in that initiative.  Aware of the threat that the pandemic poses to human development and security  we should advocate more courageous measures aimed in particular at increasing the contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  strengthening prevention methods and improving access to treatment for infected persons.  However  the many challenges facing African States are not inevitable. That is the strong conviction that led African heads of State or Government to launch the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  a comprehensive vision in which African countries have pledged  through good economic and political governance  to take control of the social  economic and political destiny of their respective nations. While NEPAD’s main goal is development  we are fully aware that there can be no development without a framework that fosters peace  security and respect for human dignity.   Our world continues to be characterized by tension and deep crises that aggravate the prevailing instability and insecurity. Old and new conflicts continue to threaten the peace and security of a number of nations  and their effects have strong repercussions at the regional and international levels.   The violent conflict that has once again shaken the Middle East — a conflict that has claimed hundreds of innocent human lives and caused enormous material damage — has shown how essential it is to do everything possible to establish a lasting peace in that part of the world. With specific regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  only collective and sustained efforts based on the principle of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security can make it possible to achieve a just  lasting and equitable settlement of that conflict. Gabon  for its part  endorses the idea of urgently holding an international conference on the Middle East.  In Africa  many hot spots of tension also remain worrisome. While we should welcome the Darfur Peace Agreement  signed at Abuja in May 2006  we must acknowledge that the overall situation remains fragile. The persistent divisions between certain parties to the conflict even threaten to jeopardize the Agreement  which was reached at considerable effort. Here  I should like to pay a well-deserved tribute to the international community  and in particular the African Union  for their tireless efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Darfur crisis.    06-53329 10   The situation in Côte d’Ivoire also continues to be a source of concern for Africa and the rest of the international community. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo  a historic and crucial phase has begun with the holding of general elections in that brotherly country. Here  I wish to pay tribute to the international community  particularly the European Union — whose EUFOR peacekeeping troops are stationed in Gabon — and to the United Nations. Its support  together with that of EUFOR  has thus far made it possible to hold smooth general elections in that country  particularly the first round of the presidential election  which took place on 30 July 2006.   It is now essential that all Congolese political actors continue  in a spirit of patriotic fervour  to consolidate the gains of the democratic transition process in an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In order to do that  they will also need the active support and sustained commitment of the international community to ensure that the enormous sacrifices made by all do not come to naught for lack of follow-up.  In that regard  the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission is an appropriate institutional response to the many needs of countries emerging from conflict. I take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador Ismael Gaspar Martins of Angola on his election as Chairman of the Commission’s Organizational Committee. I welcome the fact that two African countries  Burundi and Sierra Leone — which have experienced many years of war — have been chosen as the first countries to benefit from the Commission’s attention.  However  if our efforts to strengthen international peace and security are to be effective  they must also focus in particular on the area of conflict prevention. The excellent report of the Secretary-General on the prevention of armed conflict (A/60/891) offers us a good foundation for our work as we consider this important issue.  We achieved a major breakthrough in 2001 with the adoption of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We regret  however  that the June and July 2006 review conference for the Programme of Action ended in failure. Despite this  we need to pursue the implementation of the Programme  as well as the adoption of an international instrument on the marking and tracing of these weapons. We also need to move forward with consultations in order to begin negotiations leading to the adoption of an instrument on brokering. Similarly  we have the moral duty and shared responsibility to renew disarmament negotiations  particularly in the nuclear sphere.   One of the major trials facing our Organization is the continuation and completion of negotiations on Security Council reform  in accordance with the recommendation made by heads of State or Government at the September 2005 World Summit. We also need to implement the resolutions regarding the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly  the most recent of which was adopted on 8 September 2006 as resolution 60/286. At the same time  major negotiations in the Assembly over the past two sessions have demonstrated  if such demonstration were needed  how crucial a vitalized Assembly is for our Organization. We also need to take the appropriate measures to ensure greater transparency and consistency in the functioning of the United Nations system  ensuring improved implementation of its missions.   As you are aware  Madam President  we have a particularly heavy programme of work. I am certain that  under your able guidance  the General Assembly will make progress in the various areas of its agenda. We will therefore need to continue to work with a heightened sense of our collective interest. The very credibility of our Organization depends on it.  "
"61",2548,"GBR",61,2006,"First  I would like to pay tribute to the work of the Secretary-General. A former British Minister once said of the NATO Secretary General that he should be more of a secretary and less of a general. Kofi Annan has been more of everything: more of a diplomat  more of a reformer and more of a moral voice of leadership in the world.  In a world shattered by conflict  the founders of the United Nations saw that only by coming together  united in support of larger freedom  could we build our shared future. Today  when the world’s nations are even more interdependent than they were in 1945  what does it mean to stand  as they intended  united? At one level it means taking action when things go wrong  where there is an actual breakdown of security or a descent into violence or chaos. Today in particular  the United Nations faces the challenges posed by multiple upheavals and crises across the world.  In the Middle East the United Nations is playing a vital role in establishing stability in southern Lebanon. Troops from the European Union are deploying alongside those from the Middle East  Asia and Africa. All Member States must meet their obligations under Security Council resolutions 1701 (2006)  1559 (2004) and 1680 (2006)  if we are to enable Lebanon to be the proud  democratic and diverse nation that its people want it to be.  But we are all aware that this most recent conflict in Lebanon had its roots in the continuing failure to achieve a just solution to the Palestinian question. That is why the United Kingdom has consistently argued that there can be no higher priority than reinvigorating the Middle East peace process.  In Iraq  Prime Minister Al-Maliki’s national reconciliation plan can help leaders from all communities come together. At this crucial juncture  we must all intensify our support. The International Compact provides the right vehicle. It allows the Iraqi Government to set its own vision and shows us how we can help turn that vision into a reality.  In Afghanistan  real progress has been made  with the United Nations taking a leading role in coordinating the international effort. But real challenges still lie ahead. NATO’s task of securing the south of the country is far from easy. Soldiers from many NATO countries  not least my own  have given their lives to provide a better future for the people of Afghanistan. The Afghan Government and people  too  want security  development and good governance. The United Kingdom and the international community are determined to help them to achieve them.  We must show a similar shared determination in urging the Government of Iran to address international concerns over its nuclear ambitions and its support for terrorism. The proposals put forward by Britain  France and Germany with China  Russia and the United States offer a path for the Iranian Government to develop a more constructive relationship with the rest of the world and give Iran’s talented population the opportunities and prosperity that is their right  including  if they wish  a modern nuclear power industry. We want to be able to resume negotiations.    06-53317 20  Iran knows what is required  and that the alternative is increasing isolation.  Darfur remains in crisis. I pay tribute to the efforts of the African Union and its peacekeepers. Wednesday’s decision to extend their mandate averted a security vacuum. We must now strengthen the force of the African Union Mission in the Sudan. But it can only be a temporary reprieve. We also need action immediately on the political and humanitarian front. Those who have not signed the Darfur Peace Agreement must do so. Those who have must abide by its provisions.  To underpin that Agreement  we urgently need a greatly strengthened international presence on the ground  with the active engagement and support of Asian and Muslim  as well as African  countries. That is why the Security Council authorized the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur. I urge President Bashir to extend the Sudan’s relations with the United Nations in a common purpose to bring lasting peace and genuine stability to the whole of the Sudan. It is  above all  his responsibility.  The security challenges the world faces are real. As an international community we must deal with them. But standing united also requires us to take up a second  deeper level of global responsibility  namely  tackling the underlying problems that promote conflict and underdevelopment. We must strive to promote sound global values and to build multilateral systems within which nations and individuals can cooperate  co-exist and each achieve their potential.  Many representatives to the Assembly have already spoken of the need to accelerate progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Progress on those Goals is a moral imperative rooted in a concern for  and an understanding of  our common humanity. But it is also a political imperative  because there will be no stability and security in our global community while so many millions of men  women and children in that community face only a life of hunger  poverty  inequality and disease.  The same is true for those whose lives are shattered by conflict or blighted by injustice. The Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council are new structures that give us new opportunities and new impetus. At the same time  we must see a step change in efforts towards an international arms trade treaty that will end the irresponsible transfer of arms that fuel conflict and facilitate the abuse of human rights. That is why the United Kingdom  with six other countries  will introduce a draft resolution in the First Committee to establish a process to work towards a legally binding treaty on the trade in all conventional arms.  Collectively  we have a responsibility to protect human life and a duty to defend the international institutions that help us as a community to achieve that goal. The answers lie not in division or in personal attacks  but in the earnest and consistent pursuit of justice and peace.   Our collective responsibility to each other is nowhere more evident than in the huge challenge posed by climate change. The British Prime Minister  Tony Blair  made climate change one of our two G8 priorities last year  alongside poverty reduction in Africa. When the Prime Minister appointed me as his Foreign Secretary  in May  he specifically charged me with putting climate security at the heart of our foreign policy. We will not solve that problem if we do not each assume our share of the responsibility for tackling it. Nobody can protect themselves from climate change unless we protect each other by building a global basis for climate security. That goes to the heart of the United Nations mission  and the United Nations must be at the heart of the solution.  To put it starkly  if we all try to freeride  we will all end up in free fall  with accelerating climate change the result of our collective failure to respond in time to that shared threat that faces us all. Look just at the danger posed by rising sea levels. Potentially  that could cause massive damage to some of the key urban centres of our global civilization. London  Shanghai  Dhaka  Singapore  Amsterdam  Cairo and  yes  Manhattan are all at risk. That is why we must all — as foreign ministers  heads of Government and heads of State — be ready to do more  and do it more quickly. Our climate presents us with an ever-growing threat to international security. Dealing with climate change  by both adapting to what is now inevitable and acting to avert still greater damage  is no longer a choice  it is an imperative.  We need common commitment and genuine action. We must all be ready to find a way to get the agenda moving beyond Kyoto. The Gleneagles dialogue meeting in Mexico at the beginning of   21 06-53317  October will be one such opportunity  a chance for developed and developing countries to work together on that shared problem.   If we do not act now  an unstable climate will undermine our progress in all those other areas that matter to us  not least the Millennium Development Goals themselves. Take one of the most basic needs of all  water. Already perhaps two fifths of the world’s population finds it hard to get the water they need. At the same time  many in the world rely on affordable energy to help lift themselves out of poverty — and  indeed  perhaps to give them access to that water. But there is a dilemma: if we provide affordable energy by burning fossil fuels  we accelerate climate change. That means further disrupting water supplies. For some people who now have plenty of water it will mean new shortages. For those who already have little  it will mean less. In turn  everywhere less water means less food.  Let me give a specific example of that dilemma. The whole world  as well as the Chinese people  is benefiting from the great success of the Chinese economy. No one in China or elsewhere wants that growth to stop. But it is based  in China as elsewhere  on a rapidly increasing use of the fossil fuels that are creating climate change. Yet China is a country already vulnerable to climate change. The Chinese Government knows that as the Himalayan glaciers melt and agricultural land shrinks  crop yields will fall  fresh water will become more scarce and the economy itself will suffer  and with it the world’s economy.  All the nations of the Arctic Circle are being  and will be  affected by melting permafrost  with disruptions to infrastructure and to investment. The Vice-President of Palau has just given us a vivid description of what the environment means for his nation. We all share  to a greater or lesser extent  that same dilemma. If we do not act on climate change  we risk undermining the very basis of the prosperity and security we are seeking to achieve. That is why we must recognize that talk of having either a successful economy or a stable climate is a false choice. We must work together to find paths for economic growth that will protect our climate. The truth is that we already have much of the technology we need to move to a low-carbon economy. But we must now deploy it very much more rapidly. What we do in the next 10 years will count the most.   The former chief economist of the World Bank  Sir Nicholas Stern  will shortly publish one of the most significant and wide-reaching analyses so far of the economic impacts of climate change itself. One of the key emerging findings of his work is that while it will not cost the Earth to solve climate change  it will cost the Earth  literally as well as financially  if we do not.  Moreover  if we learn to tackle climate change together  we have an opportunity to build trust between nations and to strengthen the multilateral system. But if we get it wrong  that trust will be further eroded. It is the developed  rich world that bears a large responsibility for the present level of greenhouse gas emissions  but it is the poorest in our global community — those least able to bear it — who will bear the brunt of climate insecurity. We all need to do more. But the rich world should of course continue to lead the effort  applying the principle of common but differentiated responsibility  which must continue to be our guide. In the joint endeavour which the United Nations represents there can be no more stark or more urgent warning than that. "
"62",2572,"GEO",61,2006,"Let me begin by thanking this institution and all who subscribe to its values and mission for providing me — and the citizens of my nation — with the opportunity to address you today.  We are gathered here at a time when the challenges and opportunities for the institution of the United Nations have rarely been greater. And at this gathering  we must ask ourselves where hope for peace and prosperity would be  if the United Nations system were not such an active presence around the globe.  My country salutes the ongoing efforts to make the United Nations even more effective and welcomes the candidacy of a Secretary-General whose competence and unique perspective on gender-equality issues will help advance that goal.  Georgia is grateful for the contributions of the United Nations  for the commitment to build peace in our region and the efforts to create new opportunities for those most in need. I look forward to a continuation and deepening of that productive cooperation.   In a few weeks time  we will be celebrating the third anniversary of the peaceful  democratic revolution that brought a new era of change and progress to Georgia and the entire region. In fact  that revolution caused reactions all over the world. Ours was a revolution that gave power to its citizens  and it did so by rebuilding the fundamental social contract upon which any democracy must rest — a contract founded on respect for the principles of transparency  accountability and responsibility.  Today  citizens of Georgia’s democracy enjoy the fruits of fundamental human security  liberty  human rights and opportunity. We have changed the lives of our people  and we have done so by confronting and eliminating corruption  by fighting crime aggressively  by investing heavily in education and health care and by establishing new rules of the game — in a society where little of that existed in the past. The results of our efforts have not gone unnoticed.   In the last two months alone  the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development — to name a few international institutions — have confirmed just how much Georgia has changed. Today  we are recognized as the number one reformer in the world  as one of the least corrupt States in Europe  as an outstanding place to do    06-53317 2  business and as a role model for other countries of the region. It is fair to say that our reforms  conducted in a part of the world where few thought they were possible  have in fact performed.   In two weeks time  we will take another step  further solidifying the institutional framework upon which our democracy rests  when we conduct local elections. We are making that important investment in our democracy because we believe in the necessity of empowering our people with the responsibility and the tools to shape their own future.   I look forward to healthy competition  transparent elections and a more vibrant democratic system. That  in our view  is the way in which we can provide our State with the capacity to protect the vulnerable and provide our citizens the means to build a better life. However  like any nation undergoing great change  we still have challenges ahead. Reform continues in the judiciary and in other spheres  local self-government is building capacity and employment remains the rightful expectation of every citizen.  Our national aspirations are  however  not parochial. We see Georgia as an active and responsible member of the international community. To protect our achievements and consolidate gains  we should face common challenges and threats together. We are doing that together with our friends  partners and allies in places like Iraq  Afghanistan and Kosovo  where our troops help support international efforts to defeat terrorism and build lasting peace and democracy.  Because of that commitment  we will continue to actively pursue our membership in NATO and welcome the most recent step forward  when just yesterday Georgia was invited to join in Intensified Dialogue with NATO. That is an important decisive step towards full membership. We do so because we believe democracies are stronger when they are united  and that lasting security is best achieved through alliances based on common values.  We are a European nation and that is not a recent revelation. We would in fact be denying our history if we felt — or acted — otherwise. In the next days  my Government will be signing an action plan as part of the European Union’s European Neighborhood Policy. Thus  we will take another step  strengthening the bonds that unite the family of European democracies.  It is the goal of my Government to become a model European neighbour. We have learned from past European experiences that the proper and peaceful conduct of neighbourly relations is the foundation of long-term peace and prosperity. That which Europe has achieved in the last fifty years  we seek to achieve in our neighbourhood in a much shorter time. That is our collective challenge and common goal.  It will come as no surprise when we say that there are still grave obstacles to establishing lasting peace in my country. Reforms  especially when they are democratic  upset old interests and old habits. It is a simple statement of political fact that there are frequent attempts to undermine our reforms  our progress and our democratic way of life. We must all beware of those who believe that the presence of a stable democracy as a neighbour is threatening. Georgia’s democracy — like all democracies around the world — does not wish to be seen as threatening.  The painful truth however  is that in Georgia today we have inherited the brutal legacy of unresolved territorial conflicts. Those conflicts undermine our stability and the stability of our region. In fact  that inherited legacy is directly responsible for the systematic abuse of the fundamental human rights of a large portion of our population. Just imagine for a moment  that children who find themselves victims of those savage events are denied the right to learn or speak their native language; that the elderly are not allowed access to adequate health care; that young people cannot receive a proper education and that hundreds of thousands of people cannot return safely to their homes where they belong  from which they were systematically ethnically cleansed and which in many cases have been illegally sold or destroyed.   Further  the painful  but factual truth is that those regions are being annexed by our neighbour to the north — the Russian Federation — which has actively supported their incorporation through a concerted policy of mass distribution of Russian passports — a policy that is in direct violation of international law and is unprecedented. There are few more poignant examples of one State seeking to annex the internationally recognized sovereign territory of another State and thus undermining the other State.  Today  I would like to ask all of you in this Hall  if any Members in this great Hall would welcome — or tolerate — such interference by another Power on their   3 06-53317  own soil. I doubt it. Yet  this is the situation we are facing today in Georgia. These are the actions that we must confront as we seek to consolidate and defend our democracy. Let us never forget that the victims of conflicts are real people  that the climate of fear that they live in is pervasive and that their suffering must come to an end. With those conflicts  we have also inherited frameworks for peacekeeping and formats for negotiation that no longer function. Simply put — they neither promote peace nor do they encourage genuine negotiation. If the purpose of our revolution was to guarantee to all citizens of Georgia the right to participate fully in the life and decisions of the State  then our revolution remains unfinished.  Today  in Georgia’s conflict zones  we do not enjoy a status quo of stability and progress; that  unfortunately  is a popular fiction. Rather  we find ourselves facing a deteriorating situation in which sponsors of crime and illegality are gaining the upper hand. Let us be clear: Georgia is a responsible democracy  and if we are to take that responsibility seriously  we must acknowledge that embracing change is the only path towards a just and lasting peace.  The shortcomings of the current peacekeeper system are well documented. A few examples  taken directly from reports provided by the United Nations and the OSCE  demonstrate how Russian-dominated forces on the ground have served to perpetuate rather than resolve the conflicts and how they have abused and made a farce of the principles of neutrality  impartiality and trust. By choice  they themselves — not we — have  in effect  annulled their own status.  Since the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia  Georgia  more than 2 000 Georgian citizens of all ethnic origins have lost their lives in this zone controlled by peacekeepers  and more than 8 000 Georgian homes have been destroyed. For more than 12 years  Russian peacekeepers have been unable to facilitate the return of more than 250 000 internally displaced persons to their homes in Abkhazia  although this is explicitly stated in their mandate.  The United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) and the OSCE have been cataloguing numerous violations involving the transfer of heavy weaponry such as tanks  armoured personnel carriers  artillery  mortar  anti-aircraft systems and cannons to the separatists  even as the Georgian Government has been taking action to unilaterally demilitarize.  Russian peacekeepers have proved unable and unwilling to take any measures to halt such violations. In fact  some of them have directly encouraged such violations and assisted in them.   In South Ossetia  18 illegal military exercises using prohibited equipment were catalogued in the past year alone. Many involved the direct participation of Russian peacekeepers. This is all well documented. Unfortunately  the list goes on.  Imagine. In the village of Chubirkhinji  during talks sponsored by the United Nations  an 8-year-old Georgian boy saw his country’s flag from the window of his school and exclaimed  “Long live Georgia!” At that very moment  in front of live television cameras and in front of United Nations observers  local separatist militias moved in  arresting every single teacher in that school and taking them to undisclosed locations. That was done before the very eyes of the international community by the proxies of Russian peacekeepers.   Let us be under no illusion. The residents of our disputed territories are under a form of gangster occupation whose hope is that the international community will lose interest and reward the results of ethnic cleansing. That cannot be allowed to happen. If we stand by  we will have accepted the fact that indifference and illegality are the new rules of the international game.  This leads me to the topic of Kosovo. As the international community seeks to find a just solution to this decade-long issue  we must take stock of the extraordinarily counterproductive efforts made by the Russian Federation to abuse this unique situation for the pursuit of narrow special interests. Here  too  we must be very frank: any attempt — and many have been made — by Russian officials to create or suggest a nineteenth-century-style solution involving deals and territorial swaps in exchange for agreement on Kosovo would be not only old-fashioned but deeply immoral.  Mr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  I wish to remind all present that my country’s territories  just like yours  are not for sale or exchange. Any hint of a precedent for Abkhazia and South Ossetia would therefore be both inappropriate and reckless.    06-53317 4   The foundation of modern peace and security in Europe is based directly on the principle of respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty. Indeed  it is the cornerstone of the contemporary international order.  If the Russian Federation persists in attempting to make this dangerous linkage and undermine that fundamental order  the impact will be far-reaching and a Pandora’s box will be opened  unleashing violent separatism and conflict not only in the Caucasus but across many parts of our globe. We all must be aware of this.  I must assure the Assembly that  because we are a responsible democracy  Georgia will not allow this to happen. To that end  we will  however  work in the spirit  and on the basis  of the values that govern all civilized democracies. In this I do not believe that we are alone. It is our firm belief that  as Europe looks to intensify its relationship with its neighbours in the East  there is a strong interest in avoiding instability and in rejecting the unravelling of sovereign statehood.  It is with these goals and threats in mind that I would like to share with the Assembly my thoughts on how together we can frustrate the aspirations of those who draw strength from the cynical politics of division and fear. Responsible nations have an obligation to act accordingly  and my Government is firm in its belief that we need to transform and replace the current framework for negotiation and peacekeeping in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It is therefore our solemn duty and sovereign right to replace ineffective mechanisms with ones that work  substitute partial forces with ones that are fair  and replace fear with hope  and mutual suspicion with newfound trust.  Our efforts are guided by principles that are simple  predictable and clear. We will consult  we will cooperate  and we will commit ourselves to avoiding any policy that is destabilizing. Our goal is the pursuit of peace and a peaceful resolution.  But  again  let me be very clear. If we fail to unite in support of new mechanisms to advance peace  we will give the green light to those whose intentions lie elsewhere  and we risk plunging the region into darkness and conflict despite our best efforts to promote peace.  That is why I am proposing today a fresh road map aimed at resolving the situation whose goal is the peaceful reunification of my country within its internationally recognized borders: a country in which all the diverse ethnic groups of Georgia — and diversity is our strength — can live in peace and harmony  as they did for thousands of years  and enjoy the fruits of democracy in a society that both protects and celebrates their unique heritage; a country that invests in new schools  hospitals and roads  rather than in weapons and armaments.  The essential elements of this package must include the demilitarization of Abkhazia and South Ossetia  backed by the active engagement of the United Nations  the OSCE  the European Union and other international organizations. It must include direct dialogue between the parties on the ground  and here I mean the central Georgian Government and the separatist authorities  so that together we can assume responsibility for resuming the dialogue for peace among peoples and among different communities. These efforts can and will succeed through the establishment of an international police presence in both regions  backed  again  by the robust participation of the international community. Once such a force is in place  we will be ready to endorse its mandate by signing a comprehensive non-use-of-force pledge.  More must also be done to restore trust and improve living standards  and we are prepared to rehabilitate the economies of both regions  which is a necessity. Why should our citizens be reduced to living in such miserable economic conditions? We are ready to contribute significantly to restoring access to the opportunities that the rest of Georgia’s citizens are now starting to enjoy. Additional confidence-building measures will also be implemented.   Today  the situation in Georgia is marked by both opportunities and threats. Every day there are new provocations  and every day criminal elements consolidate their hold — actions whose consequences will have international implications. Examples include shooting at helicopters  as well as other incidents that have occurred in recent days.  As we move forward to replace and transform those anachronistic mechanisms  we continue to stand ready to work with our neighbour  the Russian Federation  because Russia must become part of the solution. Consultations aimed at changing those mechanisms have already begun and will intensify in the weeks and months ahead.   5 06-53317   It is well established and universally accepted that under international law Georgia has the sovereign right to request the removal of foreign military forces that impede the peaceful resolution of conflict. We make no secret of our intention to exercise that right  because it is based on the most fundamental principles governing a nation and the international community.  It is in the spirit of the United Nations Charter that we seek to bring the benefits of our democratic revolution to all the citizens of Georgia and to every corner of our country.  It is with the deepest respect for this institution and on this occasion that I have chosen to signal not only our desires  but also our concerns. Let no one ever say that Georgia was not clear as to how it sought to protect democracy and the State. Let no one ever say that we sought to do so by other than peaceful means. There is simply no other path for our country — or the international community at large — to follow. We chose to join the standard-bearers of civilized democracy; let no one ever say that we did not act accordingly.  We assume that all nations which share these same values are willing to make the necessary sacrifices for them  so that collectively we can achieve peace in our very important region. Let us  therefore  embrace this historic opportunity and not delay. "
"63",2619,"GHA",61,2006,"Ghana  like many other nations here  is delighted and feels proud that a distinguished lady endowed with excellent diplomatic skills has been elected to the presidency of this body. We have no doubt that she will continue the skilful stewardship of her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  the Foreign Minister of Sweden  who presided over the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.  Ghana would also like to welcome the Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United Nations  and looks forward to the day when the Organization will attain full global and universal membership.  A year ago  we met at this historic venue to adopt the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1)  in which we acknowledged that peace and security and development and human rights   11 06-52737  were the pillars of the United Nations system and the foundations of our collective well-being. We also recognized that those pillars were interlinked and mutually reinforcing and that  while each country had the primary responsibility for its own development  individual efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes  measures and policies aimed at expanding development opportunities  especially for developing countries.  Ghana therefore attaches the utmost importance to the Summit’s decision that developing countries should adopt and begin to implement by 2006 such requisite national strategies as would enable them to achieve the goals and objectives that have been agreed upon  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Ghana has therefore been working relentlessly towards that end  in the firm belief that our development partners  both bilateral and multilateral  will support us in our efforts to improve the living conditions of our people. For effective implementation  all concerned must show commitment and dispatch.  Ghana recognizes good governance as crucial to sustainable development. We have therefore worked assiduously at establishing a robust culture of democracy  sound economic management and adherence to the rule of law. The free and fair elections that have been held successfully in Ghana over the past 15 years bear eloquent testimony to the determination of Ghanaians to create an equitable  free and stable society in which each individual can develop his or her full potential. The media  freed from intimidating legislation  have blossomed into a vibrant watchdog for the probity and accountability expected of the governors and the responsibility expected of the citizens.  It is against that background that Ghana readily submitted itself to the African Peer Review Mechanism under the New Partnership for Africa’s Development to have an objective assessment of its institutional structures and their functioning for the improvement of its governance.  But our collective objective within this Organization to alleviate the economic plight of the majority of mankind may continue to elude us unless the pursuit of international peace and security is effectively and satisfactorily addressed. Ghana therefore views with grave concern the continuing spread and persistence of terrorist activities. The international community must rally to contain and effectively eradicate that menace to mankind.  In that regard  the Secretary-General’s proposal for a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is welcome. Indeed  it is the view of Ghana that there must be a quick conclusion of the deliberations on the proposed comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  Yet another scourge to the security of the world are the snail-paced talks on the elimination of nuclear weapons and the added threat of the proliferation of those weapons. Ghana shares the concerns of the majority of Member States that this body must continue with and intensify its pressure for the total elimination of those weapons  for as long as 27 000 nuclear weapons continue to exist  as they do now  our world will remain vulnerable to the threat of mass destruction.  We make this appeal not unaware of the positive uses of nuclear energy  but so long as those nations which already possess these weapons and those on the verge of breaking into the mastery of the technology do not show transparency with their know-how  the world will feel insecure. So Ghana appeals to such nations to show candour and transparency in their cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency by their compliance with the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The spread of small arms and light weapons is yet another scourge  especially for Africa. This Organization’s collective efforts to rein in that menace since 2001 have indeed yielded significant results. However  we are still far from achieving the desired target. That was borne out by the outcome of the recent Review Conference of the United Nations Programme of Action. Ghana therefore welcomes the current momentum within the international community to move closer to the ultimate goal of drastically removing the menace.  Without a doubt  the United Nations responsibility for maintaining international peace and security has been tremendously facilitated by peacekeeping operations in many troubled spots around the world. Ghana has been a dedicated and regular contributor to those operations. It is thus committed because of its conviction that the lack of peace and stability in any country can have far-reaching negative repercussions beyond its immediate borders. We therefore commend moves to enhance the United    06-52737 12  Nations peacekeeping activities that bring hope to victims of conflict.  African nations are more and more demonstrating their proactive commitment to the management and resolution of conflicts on their continent. That is why Ghana commends and supports the Secretary-General’s determination to take the necessary measures to effect the envisaged close partnership between the Organization and the African Union in that sphere  with particular reference to Darfur  in order to save the many lives threatened by the looming crisis there. Deepening Africa’s peacekeeping capacity to meet that challenging mission through training  logistical and financial support is crucial to the success of that goal. The decision taken at the 2005 World Summit in that regard must therefore be expeditiously implemented.  A monumental product of the Summit was the birth of the Peacebuilding Commission  of which Ghana is a member. Our expectation is that the 30-member Commission will discharge its functions diligently. Another significant milestone achieved by this Organization was the establishment of the Human Rights Council. I must express appreciation to this Assembly for electing Ghana with the highest number of votes to the Council.  The many resolutions and the launching of various Commissions clearly indicate the determination of our Organization to make the world a better and safer place for mankind. The truth is  however  that if this desire is to be actualized  the United Nations must undergo more radical reforms and be better equipped to effectively implement its decisions. Such a streamlined Organization will create the critical mass for tackling effectively the many challenges that threaten international peace and security. Thus  the debate to reform the Security Council based on the principles of democracy  the sovereign equality of States and equitable geographical representation  among others  is very much in order and must be supported.  Permit me at this stage to try to discharge an honourable duty that I feel uniquely placed to undertake. That is to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who is my compatriot and my friend  at the end of his exemplary tenure. He has brought much honour and distinction to our nation  Ghana  by his excellent stewardship of the United Nations over the past 10 years. Indeed  his entire adult career over the past 40 years has been at the exclusive service of this Organization  through the ranks of which he rose until he attained the pinnacle 10 years ago. His dedicated and illustrious service during the first 30 years led to his historic election as the first-ever career officer to become Secretary-General.  Destiny also marked him out as the Secretary-General to see out the last century and also usher the Organization into the twenty-first century. It cannot be disputed that these 10 years of his tenure have witnessed the phenomenal acceleration of the world in the process towards globalization. He can also claim some credit for having succeeded in shepherding our Organization deftly through the complicated and transformational challenges that the times confronted it with. He has been able to provide this masterful leadership not only through competent administration  but also in ideas as well as lofty humanistic ideals. His vision for a more proactive Organization  able to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century  has been lucidly published in his report “In larger freedom: towards development  security and human rights for all”.  He is a much decorated personality all over the world  and his winning the Nobel Peace Prize especially attests to the quality of the human being he is. There is no doubt that he retires with an enviable legacy of contributing immensely to shaping the destiny of this Organization and the affairs of the world. Ghana is proud of him and looks forward to receiving him heroically at home. I say to him in our language “Ayekoo”  meaning “well done!” "
"64",2665,"GIN",61,2006,"It is a great pleasure to extend to you  Madam President  the warmest congratulations of my delegation on your election to the presidency of the sixty-first session. In giving you their trust as the third woman to preside over the General Assembly  the Member States wished to recognize your talents as a skilled diplomat and to pay tribute to the important contribution of your country to achieving our noble ideals of freedom  peace and prosperity in the world. My country  which shares common values with yours  wishes you every    06-53609 4  success in fulfilling your mandate. I should also like to commend the remarkable work done by your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  who steered the work of the sixtieth session with great wisdom and effectiveness.  Another very pleasant duty is to convey to a valuable son of Africa  Secretary-General Kofi Annan  the highest appreciation of His Excellency General Lansana Conté  President of the Republic  for his eminent contribution to promoting the fundamental values of the United Nations. At this time  when he is getting ready to pass on the torch  I should like to express to him our deepest gratitude.   Guinea also welcomes the admission of Montenegro to the great family of the United Nations.  In September 2005 the General Assembly adopted  as the outcome of a high-level meeting  important decisions which are a road map for implementing the Millennium Development Goals and for reforming the Organization to adapt it to a changing world. My delegation is pleased with the reforms begun and the progress achieved. We welcome the establishment of the Human Rights Council  an appropriate tool to promote basic rights as well as good national and international governance. Likewise  we hope that the new Peacebuilding Commission will make an important contribution to mobilizing the necessary resources to help countries emerging from conflict.   However  six decades after the creation of the United Nations  consistent action by the Organization in terms of development  humanitarian aid and the environment is still an unfinished work. The reform of the Secretariat’s management  which implies individual and collective sacrifices  aims not only at reducing the costs of the United Nations  but also at better investment in order to enhance its effectiveness. To move forward  the international community must consolidate the reforms and extend them to the principal organs of the Organization. Guinea firmly supports this dynamic  which is the only thing that can ensure the transparency  representativeness and effectiveness of its bodies. This process depends  of course  on the political will of all its Member States  without exception.  In the maintenance of international peace and security we see reasons for both satisfaction and concern.   In Africa  and in particular the western part  my delegation is happy that peace has been restored to Guinea-Bissau  Sierra Leone and Liberia. However  the balance in these States is still precarious. We therefore urge the international community to strengthen its cooperation with their democratically elected Governments in order to strengthen peace and to ensure the rapid recovery of their economies.   In Côte d’Ivoire the peace process is entering a decisive phase  with the settlement of sensitive issues related to the holding of upcoming free and fair elections. Guinea encourages the parties to fully cooperate in continued dialogue with a view to a successful outcome to the crisis.   The significant progress made in the Great Lakes region in recent months is encouraging.   The general elections held on 30 July in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are a crucial stage in the peace process. But keeping troops of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) there  in support of Government efforts  is still crucial to restoring State authority over the entire national territory and  in particular  to bringing peace to the eastern part of the country.  In Sudan  we greatly appreciate the efforts of the international community  particularly the African Union and regional leaders  to promote peace and security in Darfur. The Abuja Peace Accord of May 2006 is a stepping stone towards the inclusive  comprehensive agreement that is crucial to that country’s stability.   In Somalia  my delegation encourages all the parties concerned to favour the path of negotiation with a view to restoring peace.   With regard to the Western Sahara  the Republic of Guinea encourages the parties in conflict to strengthen their cooperation with the Secretary-General’s Personal Envoy in order to find a political solution that is fair  lasting and mutually acceptable.  In the Middle East  Guinea regrets the fact that Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza was not followed by additional measures to put an end to the occupation of Palestinian territory. It calls upon the parties to uphold the relevant United Nations resolutions as well as the Quartet road map for the creation of two States  Palestinian and Israeli  with secure  internationally recognized borders  living side by side in peace.    5 06-53609   With respect to the Israeli-Lebanese crisis  Guinea greatly regrets the tragedy of the Lebanese people. We support effective implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  which imposes a ceasefire and the deployment of a stronger international force in southern Lebanon.  We stress the need to end the escalating violence in Iraq  in order to guarantee the country’s stability and successfully carry out national reconstruction.  In Asia  the Government of Guinea reaffirms its attachment to the one-China principle. We also attach great importance to the peaceful reunification of Korea  and the continuation of efforts to preserve peace  security and stability in the Korean peninsula.  The recommendations of the Working Group on peacekeeping operations are a reference point for taking up the challenges of peace. We welcome the greater cooperation between the Secretariat and the troop-contributing countries  which has made it possible to better understand what is at stake  thus favouring an increased contribution from Member States. The Republic of Guinea regularly takes part in peacekeeping operations  and we reaffirm our readiness to enhance our contribution within the framework of the new agreements and arrangements that will stem from the reform process.  Guinea strongly condemns all forms and manifestations of terrorism  the scourge threatening international peace and security. We value the crucial role played by the United Nations in fighting it  and therefore support the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.  In the area of disarmament  Guinea condemns the stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament. Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are two inseparable parts of the Non-Proliferation Treaty  and bind all parties  without exception.   The failure last July of the United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects should not in the least undermine our commitment to combat the proliferation of such weapons and the illicit trade in them. My country is in favour of establishing an international  legally binding instrument dealing with all the related issues. In this respect  the transformation of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Moratorium into a Convention on small arms reflects the determination of our States to eradicate this other scourge. Its success will depend upon the level of cooperation of member States and also the commitment of its partners.  The 2005 Summit was a decisive step in promoting the Millennium Development Goals. Guinea has made an effort to put in place more ambitious national development strategies. In this context  the Government has drafted a national poverty reduction strategy based on speeding up economic growth and access to basic social services  as well as improving governance. In order to implement this policy  the Government and its development partners have begun programmes and projects dealing with priority sectors  such as education  health  integrated rural development  infrastructure  the provision of water  and strengthening human and institutional capacities.   In the same spirit  the drafting in February 2005 of the second follow-up report on the Millennium Development Goal made it possible to assess the progress made  note the shortcomings and outline the prospects of achieving the Goals by 2015. We regard this as an opportunity to urge our development partners to swiftly implement the entire set of internationally recognized development initiatives  including the goals and objectives of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.   We reaffirm the urgent need to strengthen official development assistance and to assure the long-term viability of debt by cancelling all public and bilateral debt of the most heavily indebted poor countries. While condemning the impasse in negotiations of the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round  my delegation calls upon Member States to make a collective effort to prevent a return to protectionism  a factor in the deregulation of international economic relations.  Guinea took part with great interest in the High-Level Dialogue that the General Assembly has just devoted to the question of international migration and development. We reiterate our conviction that continuation of this Dialogue within the framework of the global consultative forum will help to identify ways and means to better exploit the benefits of migration for development  while mitigating its harmful effects.    06-53609 6   Although Guinea is not a country in conflict or emerging from conflict  the midterm review of the humanitarian appeal  “Guinea 2006”  points out  “Today its social indicators have become similar to those of countries emerging from a prolonged war.” That confirms the very serious consequences of the subregional instability that we have seen for more than 15 years in my country. In this respect  our Government  through me  wishes to reiterate its appeal for greater assistance in order to help the affected regions to recover. We welcome the transformation of the Central Emergency Revolving Fund into the Central Emergency Response Fund. We hope that within the common country programming process and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework  covering the period 2007-2011  the funding gaps apparent in the course of various humanitarian appeals will be filled and better provisions for Guinea will be considered.   Furthermore  deeply concerned by child trafficking  Guinea has signed with Mali and Côte d’Ivoire a memorandum of understanding to prevent this phenomenon and to improve border control.  In our common quest for a new international order  this sixty-first session of the General Assembly will be seen as one of important change for the United Nations. The reforms that we have achieved will be the beacons illuminating the path to a lasting peace and development with greater solidarity. But we must also maintain the impetus of reform and continue in our common will to make the United Nations the irreplaceable instrument to take up the enormous challenges of peace  security  development and human rights in the twenty-first century. "
"65",2704,"GMB",61,2006,"My delegation extends our heartiest congratulations to Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Her election signifies a most welcome rebalancing of the General Assembly towards greater gender parity and will certainly bring a breath of fresh air to our deliberations. We hope also that it will help our Organization address those issues of war  conflict  oppression  deprivation and terrorism that dog today’s world with the kind of compassion and sensitivity known only to mothers. I would like to assure her of my delegation’s fullest cooperation and support at all times.  The outgoing President  Mr. Jan Eliasson  applied all his wisdom and vast diplomatic experience in presiding over a session fraught with difficult and exceedingly complex organizational reform issues. We thank him for guiding us deep into the process and wish him well in his new assignment.  We should not delude ourselves into thinking that reforming the United Nations is a task that can be achieved quickly. The issues are contentious and multifaceted  and only deep reflection and determined negotiation over time will see us through. For this reason  we should not feel disheartened that one year after the World Summit we have still not concluded the process. We should congratulate ourselves on having achieved a breakthrough with the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Management reform is problematic  but the desire to achieve it in a fair and balanced manner will remain a key demand of developing countries. A selective approach to reforming the Organization will work in no one’s interest. Some reforms are long overdue and sorely needed.   For us in Africa  Security Council reform is urgent and must be concluded as soon as possible. Recent events have demonstrated that the old dispensation is ill equipped to grapple with the complexities of the world we live in today. Reform  I repeat  is urgent if today’s Security Council is to be seen as poised to take on the new global peace and security challenges facing mankind.  We are gathered together at a time of great uncertainty and  for many  despair because of our collective inability and lack of will to abide by the guiding principles of our founding fathers. We have not been too successful in preventing the scourge of war or in addressing the factors that give rise to war.   Rather than abating  the situation in the Middle East continues to fester and  in fact  deteriorate  as the Road Map leading to a two-State solution to the Palestinian-Israeli problem eludes us further. My delegation has repeatedly decried the lack of will on the part of the protagonists to work towards a speedy solution to this problem  which continues to spawn many other conflicts in other regions of the world.   It is a matter of deep regret that this world body watched almost helplessly as a Member State — Lebanon — was attacked and made to suffer extensive destruction to infrastructure  property and human life. Although we have been able to bring about a cessation of hostilities  we cannot claim to have achieved peace. All the conditions for a resumption of the conflict remain intact. We must address those conditions more    06-53341 26  resolutely. We must also do everything within our power to ensure that the problem between Hizbollah and Israel does not pull in other countries of the region and lead to full scale war between them and Israel. The consequences would be disastrous for us all.  My delegation condemns in the strongest terms Israel’s continued illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and Arab lands  its intensive military campaign in the West Bank and Gaza  which has resulted in untold civilian casualties and extensive destruction of infrastructure  and its arrest and detention of thousands of Palestinian civilians and their leaders. The Hamas Government in Palestine was elected democratically by the Palestinian people  who  by the tenets of democracy which we all claim to espouse  are the only ones who may freely choose their leaders. Or are we to understand that this basic tenet of democracy should apply only if the leaders chosen are to our liking and meet with our approval? I urge all peace-loving and democratic members of the international community to assist the Hamas Government to play its role as a representative of its people in a responsible  democratic and dignified manner.  In Iraq  the unresolved conflict has now become uncontrollable and has all but degenerated into civil war. We must look for imaginative ways of stabilizing that situation and bringing the widespread killings  destruction and suffering to an end.  We must show leadership. Double standards have affected the effectiveness of our response to the peace and security needs of the Middle East for far too long and have only muddied the waters further. The people of the region must now enjoy some respite and be given the space to pursue their development in an atmosphere of peace  tranquillity and security. It is becoming increasingly clear that the only remaining honest broker that can ensure that this happens is the United Nations. We must step up to the plate.  Violence in Afghanistan appears to be re-escalating. The United Nations must join hands with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other partners to engage all concerned in dialogue  with a view to addressing the factors that are driving the hostilities to which the long-suffering people of this great country are subjected.  While we must obviously intervene to contain and arrest raging conflicts  we must not be oblivious to the need to pay equal attention to nascent conflict situations. One such situation is that which is prevailing across the Taiwan Strait  where the People’s Republic of China has openly threatened Taiwan with military intervention  should it as much as express an intention to declare itself independent. In addition  the People’s Republic of China has increased its arsenal of missiles trained on Taiwan to over 800 warheads. It goes without saying that a deterioration of the situation into all-out war will only provoke an unwelcome mix of responses from allies within and without the region  responses that could cause a conflagration that would make the Middle East situation pale in comparison.  In Africa  the good news is that peace continues to spread. From Sierra Leone and Liberia to Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  we are witnessing a growing preference for non-violent approaches to conflict resolution. We should persist so that this trend continues and embraces countries such as Somalia and the Sudan  with its Darfur imbroglio.   In Somalia  the central Government should be assisted to stand firmly on its own two feet and exercise control over the entire Somali territory. The international community must take every precaution to prevent Somalia from becoming a haven for terrorists and other extremists.   In the case of the Sudan  my delegation appeals to the brotherly people of that great country to intensify dialogue with the international community in its quest for a resolution of the Darfur crisis. In reaching a final decision on whether or not the African Union Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) should pass the baton to a United Nations peacekeeping force  we are certain that  with a bit more effort on all sides  a way will be found out of the present impasse.  While we must all work in concert to fight terrorism  we must also endeavour not to lose respect for fundamental human rights and civil liberties in the process. In addition  we must increase our cooperation in this fight and strengthen political and diplomatic interventions in order to win it. No matter how many resources or how much firepower are committed to combating the phenomenon  without international cooperation of this type  our efforts will come to naught. Recent developments in countries like Iraq have shown that to be the case.  Last year  we all rededicated ourselves to the full implementation of the Millennium Declaration. There   27 06-53341  are ample indications today that the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are not likely to be met in most of sub-Saharan Africa if present trends continue. It is clear that we must all do more to identify and help remove the bottlenecks that are inhibiting progress towards them. We must address the serious capacity constraints that circumscribe the development efforts of many an African country. We must help stimulate economic growth through enabling policy measures that empower our countries for greater and more meaningful participation in world trade. We must make real progress in the Doha round. We must increase foreign direct investment in the African economy. We must honour our commitment to increasing official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of gross national income. We must  in partnership  attack the great health scourges of our time  namely  HIV/AIDS and malaria.  In the Gambia  United Nations and other independent assessments indicate that  on many fronts  we are making steady progress. We are committed to achieving the MDGs  in addition to the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development.   We have reversed the spread of HIV/AIDS. We have already achieved gender parity in education and  by extension  registered significant progress in gender equality  equity and the empowerment of women. We have brought potable water and good sanitation to over 70 per cent of our people. We have reduced the prevalence of malaria and the incidence of maternal and under-five mortality. We have attained 100 per cent child immunization coverage. We have significantly increased access to education at all levels and shall meet the basic education goal  God willing  next year or the year after. Our sharpest focus is on poverty reduction  and we are determined to attain that goal before 2015.  We have been able to achieve these gains  in spite of the severe resource constraints that we face  because of determined and committed leadership and our strong resolve to live up to our commitments to the international community.  According to the expert assessments of the United Nations agencies  the Gambia is among the very few African countries that will achieve the MDGs on target  if present trends continue. Our achievements in relation to the development agenda have been made possible only through strong and genuine partnerships  which we hope will continue and will grow to meet the task ahead.  The trade policy of our Government continues to be guided by the principles of liberalization  deregulation and investment promotion. We have brought about a progressive reduction of tariffs and continued improvements in infrastructure to increase our competitiveness as a production and trade gateway into West Africa.   We regard the private sector as an important engine of growth. Therefore  to further enhance its development  our Government has formulated policies for the systematic strengthening of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector of our economy. It is our hope that implementation of these policies will lead to the creation of conditions conducive to the speedy attraction of high levels of foreign direct investment which will  in turn  stimulate the growth of employment and incomes and lead to significant reductions in the incidence of poverty among the Gambian people.  We are conscious of the need for all our development partners to speak to us with one voice so as to increase coherence in the partnership. To this end  we have this year encouraged our major multilateral partners — the World Bank  the African Development Bank Group  the International Monetary Fund  the United Nations Development Programme and its Millennium Project — to work together with us in crafting a coherent Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which will form the basis for a coordinated framework of partnership in development.  The President returned to the Chair.  There are many commendable programmes and initiatives designed to assist countries like the Gambia. The Group of Eight initiatives for Africa  the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  the Blair Commission for Africa  the Millennium Challenge Account and the Third Tokyo International Conference on African Development  inter alia  will have an impact only if they do not raise the bar unrealistically high  such that the countries they are meant to assist are unable to meet the stringent criteria for gaining access to the funds. If aid is to be meaningful  it must be accessible  predictable and not fragmented. Moreover  a well-designed aid architecture that    06-53341 28  involves recipients in critical aspects of decision-making is part of the answer for achieving the much-sought effectiveness of official development assistance  a subject of concern in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  Yet  while those programmes and initiatives may encourage many least developed countries in their hopes for early relief  in reality  the accompanying enablers have not been forthcoming. The Doha Round is in limbo  our modest economic growth is being threatened by unpredictably high energy prices  and debt relief is still on the distant horizon. For many of us  it is one step forward before world economic trends take us two steps back. Of even greater concern is the fact that this plethora of initiatives has hardly made a dent in the poverty situation in our countries. The blueprints are manifold  the responses too few. Unfulfilled promises only dash our hopes  leave us frustrated and diminish our faith in the effectiveness of international partnerships for development.  We in the Gambia continue to deepen our democracy. Just four days ago  the Gambian electorate went to the polls to once again choose their leader in a free and fair manner. Let me take this opportunity to convey the thanks and appreciation of His Excellency Al Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh to the many delegations that have expressed to him their congratulations and best wishes on his resounding victory at the elections. The President considers that victory to be a mandate from the Gambian electorate to continue his service to the Gambian people and  indeed  to the international community at large. Our electoral process has been acclaimed throughout the world for its openness  fairness and transparency.  The subject of the High-level Dialogue held just a few days ago was international migration and development. For the very first time  we had the courage to address that issue within the walls of the United Nations — and rightly so  for international migration has been at the core of human history. It has driven the spread of human knowledge and civilization. It has enriched cultures and societies and caused mankind to make great leaps in science  technology  engineering and overall social and economic development. We are all migrants. Therefore  let us approach the issue of international migration with humanity  tolerance  respect and compassion.  Attempts to penalize or criminalize international migration will not work. In our globalized village  international migration is an undeniable  positive and indispensable force for keeping the wheels of national economies and human society in motion. We must look to the positive side of this natural human activity and desist from actions that trample on the dignity of migrants  as well as from acts of racism  xenophobia and abuse of human rights.  As the saying goes  injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. For decades  extensive illegal and extraterritorial measures have been pursued against Cuba  a small  friendly and democratic nation. They have not worked and will never work. My delegation joins the vast majority of the members of the international community in calling for the lifting of the decades-long embargo against Cuba in order to enable the hard-working people of that great country to pursue their development aspirations in an atmosphere of peace. Let us all strive to live and let live.   By the same token  we must also urgently address the question of Taiwan. The legitimate quest of the people of Taiwan for a voice and standing in the United Nations must be ignored no longer. Taiwan is an important actor in our global economy and contributes immensely to global peace and security. It must be formally granted recognition as a responsible member of the international community. A simple way to grant that recognition would be to give Taiwan its rightful place in the United Nations.  In that connection  the Government of the Gambia wishes to strongly protests the General Committee’s violation of the rules of procedure on 12 September this year by amalgamating two items proposed by its members into one agenda item  thus preventing members from participating in the discussion of those items. We will therefore require a legal opinion from the United Nations on an expedited basis to ensure that we are provided with the opportunity to engage in a debate on that issue  as we are duly entitled to do.   Before I conclude  let me salute  commend and bid farewell to one of Africa’s outstanding personalities  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  since this will be the last General Assembly session during his tenure as Secretary-General. President Al Hadji Yahya Jammeh had the honour to pay tribute to him during the Summit of Heads of State and Government   29 06-53341  of the African Union held in Banjul in July. Therefore  I should like to say only that the Government and the people of the Gambia salute his leadership  his astute diplomatic skills  his demonstrated commitment to international peace  security and development  and his unswerving faith in the international system. Mr. Annan’s term as Secretary-General may be ending  but I am sure that he will continue to be there for us and will willingly come to the rescue when we need his wisdom and vast experience in mediating complex global problems. We wish him well in his future endeavours  and we wish him and his family continued good health and happiness in their new life. "
"66",2744,"GNB",61,2006,"The sixty-first session of the General Assembly has begun its work in quite a disturbing context. We note the persistence of certain conflicts and the emergence of new hot spots of tension  which are serious threats to international peace and stability. World poverty and hunger have not decreased  despite the enormous efforts of our countries to improve the living conditions of our populations. In fact  we note a deterioration in the social and health conditions of millions of people as a result of endemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria  particularly on the African continent.   The political  economic  financial  social and environmental problems facing the world are assuming increasingly alarming proportions. That requires concerted efforts on the part of the entire international community. Therefore  we must work together to strengthen the existing multilateral system and the capacity of the United Nations to act in order to address those challenges more effectively.  Our people expect concrete  swift and effective measures from the Organization  involving the establishment of modern and efficient operational structures. In short  reforms within the United Nations system are necessary and urgent.   It is in that context that  on behalf of my country  Guinea-Bissau  which it is my honour to represent  I warmly congratulate you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at the present session. We believe that your many qualities and your long experience are guarantees of the success of our work. Under your guidance  we will experience a new dynamism capable of promoting joint efforts for peace. I would like to assure you of the availability and full cooperation of our delegation in contributing to the achievement of the our common goals.   Allow me to congratulate your predecessor as well  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his dedication to the cause of our Organization and for the important results achieved during the sixtieth session. I reference in particular to the creation of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  of which my country is a member.   We recently participated in the fourteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana  where a large number of world leaders gathered. Those eminent personalities  including the head of State of Guinea-Bissau  considered the world’s problems  the seriousness of which calls to us all and demands of us concerted and collective actions. The conclusions reached at the Summit  as well as the initiatives we intend to undertake on behalf of our Movement  are in line  to a large extent  with the opinions  recommendations and solutions set out by the Secretary-General in his annual report on the work of the Organization  delivered during a brilliant speech to the Assembly.   None today can doubt the seriousness of the situation in the Middle East  particularly in Lebanon. It is the same with regard to the tragic conditions in which millions of our African brothers live in Darfur. It is clear that we can no longer accept the systematic violation of international norms. Nor can we understand why we are incapable of taking concerted  negotiated and responsible measures to put an end to a tragic situation that threatens the lives of innocent and vulnerable people. Our brothers in Darfur have the right to the compassion and solidarity of Africa in particular  and of the international community as a whole.   If current trends in the world continue  poor countries will not be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The reforms that are planned or that have already been introduced into our systems of governance  respect for the rules of democracy and respect for human rights are     06-53341 30  unfortunately  insufficient to achieve the rates of growth essential to relaunch our economies.  In our countries  the economic and financial situation depends on internal and external factors that we do not control. Protectionist measures and subsidies for agricultural products such as cotton  sugar and wheat seriously compromise the competitive capacity of our farmers. The absence of an agreement on the rules that should govern international trade and the lack of political will and of progress in the negotiations within the World Trade Organization are aggravating factors.  We need to recognize that we are far from achieving the objectives set out in the Monterrey Consensus and Johannesburg Plan of Implementation  which concern developing countries  particularly the least developed countries. We also feel the imbalance in the globalization process. These are serious obstacles to our development. The midterm review for the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 has indeed shed new light on the shortcomings and on the still-insufficient level of development assistance. In this environment  our efforts to eliminate poverty and create better living conditions within our countries are at risk.   A large part of our populations  particularly our young people  are more and more despondent because of the very high level of unemployment and lack of hope for a better future. Thousands of young people are so desperate that they even risk their lives to seek other forms of existence  which  unfortunately  often turn out to be mirages. The international community must accord greater attention to this issue so that we might find the means to ensure the rebirth of hope in the hearts of our youth. I am thinking especially of creating professional training centres and promoting activities that generate jobs  thus ensuring more and better social integration.  I would also like to stress in this regard the importance of the High-level Meeting on International Migration and Development  which for the first time met here at the Headquarters of the United Nations. I am convinced that thanks to this type of dialogue and cooperation at the international level  we will be better equipped to put a brake on illegal immigration and on organized crime  to which this tragic phenomenon is more and more linked.   Guinea-Bissau  with a considerable number of citizens living abroad  pays particular attention to the issue of migration. Therefore we welcome the place it occupies on the agenda of the international community. We support the relevant recommendations emerging from the High-level Dialogue on Migration and Development that took place here in New York  two weeks ago. We are aware of the role played by our diaspora in the economy of developing countries  thanks to remittances and other forms of contributions. My country is committed to developing an appropriate national policy on this issue in cooperation with our development partners  especially with the countries of destination.   On 17 July Guinea-Bissau hosted the sixteenth Conference of the Heads of State Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). The heads of State of our community reaffirmed their determination to step up efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty. They also committed themselves to undertaking concrete measures to mobilize internal and external resources for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The consolidation of democracy  the rule of law and human rights issues were also subjects of particular attention for these leaders. They are indispensable preconditions for international peace and security. The heads of State also decided to strengthen relations between the CPLP and the United Nations and its specialized agencies in order to establish an effective partnership.   Allow me in this respect to thank  on behalf of the CPLP  all our partners for the important assistance they have given to the weakest members of our community. I would also like to appeal to our development partners in general and to the Group of Eight countries in particular  requesting that they assist us in addressing the critical issue of external debt burden.  One year after elections in Guinea-Bissau  which confirmed the return to constitutional normality in my country  I should like to reiterate here the commitment of the people  Government and especially that of Mr. João Bernardo Vieira  President of Guinea-Bissau  to spare no effort in consolidating peace and establishing political stability and national reconciliation. Significant progress has been made in this area. It must  however  be stressed that the complexity of the current reforms  especially within the defence and security forces  requires lasting and   31 06-53341  substantial support from the international community  given the lack of resources available to us.   I would like to express our appreciation to all our partners  especially our brothers in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP)  for their support and the creation of the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau  whose first meeting was held here at the United Nations Headquarters last week. I would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that my country will spare no effort to continue to deserve your confidence and solidarity. Nonetheless  it must be stressed that  despite our willingness and determination  Guinea-Bissau needs your urgent assistance in order to implement the measures contained in the national poverty reduction strategy paper. Just adopted by our Government  that document will serve as the basis for preparing a roundtable on Guinea-Bissau planned for next November at Geneva. It is a pleasure to invite all our traditional partners and others here present to take part in that roundtable  which will  indeed  be an event of great importance for stimulating our economy and for raising the living conditions of our people.   Today’s world is a genuine global village. Mankind’s progress in science  information technology  communications and transportation means that the destinies of our peoples are more and more interdependent. That is why we must combine our efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger in the world and to deal with endemic diseases  such as HIV/AIDS  and to put an end to injustices  violations of human rights and all forms of discrimination and intolerance.  When we discuss the issues of development and combating poverty  we must resist the temptation of taking the easy way and applying simplistic solutions. Economic and social development and its corollary  the eradication of poverty  require deep thought and courageous measures. No phenomenon can be explained simplistically  and there is no simple universal recipe. The signs of the times must be correctly interpreted. Peoples’ opinions  their culture  their religious practices and their concerns must all be understood and respected. We must find new ways of reorganizing and strengthening democratic States by giving priority to education and training. We must also think about the need to increase our collective capacity to combat terrorism and to deal with all forms of extremism through permanent dialogue between cultures and civilizations.  It is incomprehensible  and even less acceptable  that human beings are abandoned and condemned to die under the indifferent regard of the international community. International solidarity towards vulnerable populations must not be delayed or be given under post mortem conditions. The international community must demonstrate vigilance and be capable of preventing all humanitarian catastrophes resulting from conflicts  as the Secretary-General rightly recalled  in the name of a universal conscience. It is precisely because of the universal nature of the responsibility of our Organization that Guinea-Bissau will spare no effort in order to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations through concerted  pragmatic and efficient reforms. In fact  the effectiveness of our Organization would be even greater with the full participation of all Member States with a view to enhancing our multilateral institution  which needs greater democracy and transparency in fulfilling its mandate.  More than sixty years after its founding  the United Nations must adapt to the changes that have taken place in the world in order to take into account the existence and the emergence of new players on the world stage whose contribution to peacekeeping and international security are becoming more and more important. Among those States are countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America  which can legitimately lay claim to a permanent seat on the Security Council. Developing countries in Africa  Asia and Latin America have the right to greater participation and prominence on the Security Council.  Ten years ago  we elected Kofi Annan  an outstanding son of Africa  to guide the destiny of our Organization. As we assess his tenure  it is with pride and satisfaction that we note the achievements during his term of office. Recent years have not been easy  because the world is confronting new and longstanding challenges in various forms and scales and for which our Organization was insufficiently designed and prepared. On behalf of Guinea-Bissau  the President of Guinea-Bissau  João Bernardo Vieira  and our Government  I would like to add our voice to the vibrant tribute paid by the entire international community to the Secretary-General. I would also like to express the gratitude of our people to him for the contribution of the United Nations system in promoting    06-53341 32  peace  political stability and development in our country.  The great challenges of the new millennium will determine the development work facing us and the capacity of people to resolve  as quickly as possible  problems of peace  political stability  national reconciliation and social justice. All States and civil society must be able to count upon  whenever required  the transparent and democratic functioning of the United Nations system for the defence of their rights  in a perspective that creates consensus and which is compatible with human development  namely compatible with the well-being of humanity.  As the General Assembly prepares to select a successor to Mr. Kofi Annan  it will  I am convinced  be able to elect a Secretary-General with the essential attributes of skill  experience and dedication for promoting better understanding between peoples and nations of this world.  The determination and leadership of the next Secretary-General will also be necessary in order to establish synergy and international cooperation so as to transform the United Nations into a unique and irreplaceable instrument that can strengthen multilateralism in favour of development  of improved conservation of our planet and of international peace and security. "
"67",2783,"GNQ",61,2006,"Equatorial Guinea is participating in the debates of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly in the firm conviction that this world Organization remains the only forum with the authority necessary to resolve any situation facing the international community. Attempting to usurp that authority is irrational; it means negating the universal principles of international law  which govern our world with justice and equity.   That is why  before addressing any of the issues on our agenda  I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  and to His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  for the arduous task that they accomplished in the face of the conflicts that have threatened the peace and stability of the planet during 2006.  We should also like to welcome the election of Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  Legal Adviser to the Royal Court of Bahrain  who will preside over the General Assembly at this session. We believe that her election is an implicit recognition of the seriousness  dedication and dynamism that characterize her country’s quest for global equilibrium and its respect for the principles of international law  human freedom  the right of peoples to self-determination  national independence and sovereignty  mutual respect among nations  and international cooperation to promote development and respect for human rights.  This session opens at a time of uncertainty for humanity  due to the many conflicts and the increasing socio-political imbalance threatening the lives of millions of people throughout the world. Humanity today finds itself in a complex situation that raises several questions.  What is the current role of the United Nations  given the absence of priorities in its decision-making process? What has been gained since the end of the cold war? What kind of future can humanity hope for in a world of so-called globalization  governed by a political and economic system characterized by inequality and a lack of cooperation in eradicating poverty in the weakest nations? What kind of future is there for the developing countries when the gap in the acquisition of technology for development continues to grow  or when sprawling intelligence services are constantly devising plans to keep the world under the political dominance and economic influence of the most powerful nations?  Those and similar questions must be the focus of attention of politicians and this world body if we are to straighten this crooked path in international relations. Presently  there is no judge capable of adjudicating any international conflict equitably and impartially. From   23 06-52885  our point of view  the authority of the United Nations has been taken hostage by certain interests that are monopolizing the world. Nevertheless  I am convinced that we still have time to rescue the situation if we do not wish to see the international community completely derailed  because the results obtained to date are not satisfactory.  We must first democratize this world Organization by reinstating its rightful authority on the international scene. We must also set an objective value to the globalization of politics by adopting new  equitable political and economic strategies to protect the legitimate interests of the weakest States. If we do not  we must be prepared to endure a world crisis as a result of our inability to sustain the current pressures and jarring disparities among nations.  Many conferences held in various political  economic and social forums have identified a number of strategies to reduce the gap that separates us all  but such strategies have always been met with the complete indifference of those who are supposed to execute them.  We ought not be surprised  then  by the phenomenon of terrorism that threatens the world today  because  although its methods and destructive effects on humans are condemnable  it remains the recourse of the oppressed and a reaction of those who oppose prevailing injustices that have been denounced throughout the last quarter of a century.  The ongoing mass migration of peoples from the South to the North is another consequence of the huge imbalance caused by the present unjust international economic system. That migration will never cease if the North does not help the South to develop with programmes of support and solidarity.  We would like to see democracy  equity and solidarity in a more harmonious world become the rule that would enable international relations to function  especially those governed by the Bretton Woods institutions  the World Trade Organization  the relationship between the European Union and the nations of the African  Caribbean and the Pacific  and all other economic relations between the North and the South.  Moreover  nature has endowed the world with immense natural resources that are perfectly sufficient to allow all to live in dignity. We do not have to resort to draconian rules of exchange that favour some and discriminate against others. Those who seek to monopolize resources that belong to humanity and who still believe in the larceny of the past  or rather in their own ability to perpetuate illegal exploitation by force  are the same people who today support and maintain vast mercenary organizations that fall upon the weaker nations in order to create internal political instabilities for their own selfish interests.  Indeed  my country has been a victim of such plotting because we own crude oil  the product that is today dividing and destroying the world. My country was able to avert a mercenary invasion on 6 March  2004  that was organized by powerful countries that continue to dispute among themselves and to nurture ambitions to gain free control of the world’s petroleum. Fortunately  our security services were alerted in time and were able to prevent the anticipated genocide. Those directly responsible for the attempted coup are serving time in prison  while the brains behind the whole thing are still at large and thumb their noses at justice.  Nevertheless  my Government does not believe that this natural resource belongs to us alone. My country benefits from barely 30 per cent of the proceeds from that exploitation  because  as we have explained time and again  due to an unjust system of exchange  the operating contracts give the lion’s share of those profits to our partners of the North.  In that regard  I noted at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly that if the responsibility of transparency is to be borne equitably  there is a need to demand the same from the operators of the extracting industries and compliance with the contracts and regulations that guarantee equal benefits between the parties concerned.  To conclude  the message from Equatorial Guinea is that we must respond as human beings  because we still have time to make this planet Earth a better place for human beings. Therefore  let us turn our backs on greed  hegemonic ambition and the lack of sensitivity to the sight of such horror and misery that is rife in our world  so that we can respond to this system of injustice and inequality  and so that  as human beings  we will be able to join hands and face  with solidarity  intelligence and wisdom  the challenge to spare humanity from the scourges of war  poverty and underdevelopment.

"68",2829,"GRC",61,2006,"Allow me  Madam  to add my heartiest congratulations to you on being the third woman in the history of the United Nations to be elected President of the General Assembly  particularly at such a critical moment. Your election is an inspiration for women everywhere who are struggling to achieve equality and opportunity. You illustrate the truth that  as Plato wrote 2 400 years ago  any society that does not exploit the talents of its women is wasting half of its resources. I also wish to congratulate and thank your predecessor  my friend and colleague Jan Eliasson  for all he worked so hard to achieve during his term.   While we are recognizing service to the United Nations  we would be remiss if we did not extend our appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. I want to express the appreciation of my Government for all his efforts to maintain and strengthen the prestige and moral authority of the Organization.   I would also like to welcome Montenegro to the family of States. (spoke in French)  Greece fully aligns itself with the statement made by the President of Finland on behalf of the European Union (EU). We would also like to express our views on the major questions that the United Nations will be dealing with in the session that is now opening.  It is just the beginning of the twenty-first century  and the future looks threatening: we see poverty  war  humanitarian crises  refugee flows  terrorism  arms proliferation  human trafficking  drugs  sectarian violence  environmental degradation and natural disasters. In order to understand the full extent of these calamities  we must identify and understand  and then deal with  their roots  which have been formed over the centuries. We have to unite the force of our ideas and resources and mobilize what we have in common — that is  our humanity. As taught to us by the philosopher Isocrates  the condition for peace is not money  which buys men  or force  which subjugates them; it is the all-encompassing power of goodwill.  The United Nations is a unique forum  the place where  as individuals and as nations  we offer the best of ourselves. We need this Organization to be strong and productive. We draw from it the strength that frees us from mistrust to overcome conflicts  the strength that allows us to move forwards towards greater understanding and tolerance.  Terrorism is the scourge of our times. It is a blind evil that takes no account of our religion  our race or our gender. This danger must be confronted collectively. It is neither possible nor desirable to confront it alone. We will firmly support the efforts undertaken by the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee  and we are prepared to provide it with all necessary assistance. Finally  we would like to support the counter-terrorism policy that the Secretary-General will soon be presenting to the General Assembly. The best way to confront terrorism is to promote peace  tolerance  the acceptance of others and  above all  development: no longer to abandon anyone by the wayside and to give everyone the opportunity to access what is essential for life.  In the light of what I have said  and bearing in mind the General Assembly’s main theme for this year — to create a global partnership for development — this is both timely and appropriate. Translating this vision into fact must happen at the global level  and for this we need significant participation by all countries in the economic and financial decision-making process. The International Monetary Fund’s recent decision to increase the voting rights of countries such as China and India is an important step in the right direction.  The news coming from the Doha round  however  is not encouraging. The clock is ticking; and each day it becomes even more important for all parties to put their shoulders to the wheel to reach an agreement  with the objective of creating an effective multilateral    06-53323 22  trading system. The winners will be the developing countries — but also the developed countries.  Equally important is the need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in line with the agenda established by heads of State or Government at the Summits of 2000 and 2005. Among our objectives  clearly  is to reach the critical threshold of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to be allocated for official development assistance to the countries most seriously affected by economic difficulties. That is the keystone of a global partnership for development  which we are committed to forging as soon as possible.  Developing countries  for their part  need to follow sensible economic policies. They need to undertaken reforms that will encourage growth  and they need to finally improve governance by creating institutions that are accountable and operate with complete transparency. It is only together  through collective action  that we will be able to correct the inequalities that are at the root of many of the conflicts in the world.  Allow me to stress in this respect that Africa must be the highest of our priorities. We must pay heed to the dormant conflicts in West Africa  East Africa and Central Africa if we want to avoid the kinds of crises being played out in the Sudan and other countries on the continent. The African Union is best placed to put an end to these conflicts  and we must help it by finding lasting solutions to the problems that make life so cruel in very many of these regions.  Another urgent need is to act effectively and speedily to put an end to the suffering of the populations of these countries  so that we no longer see babies dying of AIDS when a few dollars’ worth of medicines can save them. (spoke in English)  The tensions in the Middle East demand equal attention. The Middle East is the region that will test the mettle of this Organization as a force for peace in the immediate future. If we fail in that test  all of us stand to pay a heavy price. During the past several months  we all witnessed unforgettable images of suffering and destruction in that part of the world.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the root of most problems in the region  and it is obvious that it should be at the top of the list of our priorities if peace and stability are to return to that area. The Road Map offers the strategic plan for a solution based on the principle of land for peace  especially since basic elements of it are well known and generally accepted by the international community. The Road Map is in essence a performance-driven guide to a settlement based on all relevant Security Council resolutions  including resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  and on the conclusions of the Madrid Conference and the Beirut Arab Summit. We must all make every effort to see that they are implemented.  On Lebanon  strict implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) provides the blueprint for resolving the basic problems that led to the recent crisis. We understand the difficulties before us  but we must push ahead resolutely  because determination and tenacity are essential to tackling long-standing issues in volatile regions.  The continued violence and instability in Iraq are a cause of great concern for all of us. It is critical that every possible effort be made to bring order and unity to that troubled country. Deaths  especially of civilians  have reached terrifying levels  with no end in sight to the slaughter. All who have any influence with the warring factions in Iraq must try to make them see what pain and suffering they have inflicted on their own people and what yet worse horrors they will unleash on their land if they continue to drift towards a devastating civil war.  Our own region  the Balkans  was once known as history’s cauldron. We endured a century of bitter ethnic  religious and ideological conflicts  up to very recent times. We are moving rapidly  however  to disown that label for the sake of our own peoples and of the new Europe we are building. Some trouble spots remain  but we are trying to deal with them in a new spirit of cooperation and tolerance.  Kosovo is one issue that still needs attention. The status talks are under way  and we hope that they will produce a viable settlement that will strengthen the security and stability of the entire region. Right now  this appears difficult. To overcome the impasse will require patient and careful diplomacy. Our goal in reaching a viable long-term solution should not be compromised by setting an artificial deadline.  I deeply regret the fact that the Cyprus problem remains unresolved. For all 32 years of the military occupation of one third of the territory of Cyprus by well over 40 000 Turkish troops  Greece has strongly   23 06-53323  supported every United Nations initiative aimed at the achievement of a comprehensive solution. We are committed to doing everything possible to achieve a just and viable solution  on the basis of the pertinent Security Council resolutions and of EU principles and values. We strive for a bizonal  bicommunal federation that will bring peace and prosperity to the island. Our goal remains a solution agreed between the two communities without arbitration and tight timetables  to be approved subsequently by referendums. To those efforts we are prepared to lend our wholehearted support.  Greece’s foreign and security policy is based on the principles enshrined in the Charter  especially those relating to the peaceful settlement of disputes and good-neighbourly relations. This basic framework is also reflected in my country’s continuing efforts to further improve relations with Turkey and to consolidate mutual understanding and cooperation. For our part  we are trying to overcome the remaining difficulties and are continuing to take initiatives to widen and deepen cooperation in all fields so that the relationship with Turkey becomes a win-win situation for both countries. In this context  we are hopeful that Turkey will reciprocate so that our countries can solidify good-neighbourly relations.  European integration is the bright promise on the horizon for the entire region of South-Eastern Europe — a future which will encompass greater cooperation and interaction among all the countries in the area and at long last heal the wounds of the past century.  We live in a troubled world  and the United Nations is always enmeshed in the worst of the troubles so that it sometimes seems that it is not accomplishing much. We must not forget  however  the conflicts it has resolved  the misery it has diminished  the suffering it has relieved and the pain it has eased all over the world in its brief lifetime.  “Man feeds on dreams of hope”  Aeschylus wrote. For men  women and children everywhere  the United Nations remains the best hope there is. "
"69",2870,"GRD",61,2006,"I am indeed honoured to join previous delegations in congratulating Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the Assembly at this sixty-first session. Let me assure her of Grenada’s support as she guides these important deliberations towards the implementation of a global partnership for development.  My delegation would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Eliasson  Foreign Minister of Sweden  who laboured tirelessly during his presidency of the sixtieth session  and for his efforts in guiding the follow-up process to the Summit Outcome.  My delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s tenth and final report  which gives a comprehensive review of the Organization’s achievements  challenges and preparation for the future. It is fitting at this juncture to convey to the Secretary-General the appreciation of the Government and people of Grenada for his sterling contribution to world peace and security during his tenure at the helm of this Organization. The road was not always smooth  but with his calm disposition  unmistakable eloquence and astute and dedicated leadership  the Organization was able to overcome the rough patches. We heartily commend his efforts to strengthen the United Nations through the reform process  and wish him well in his future endeavours.  We meet in very difficult times. The effects of rapid technological changes  new geopolitical and economic alliances  evolving rules in international trade  and in particular security concerns  continue to grip ordinary citizens in our small countries and regions  worsening the notion of an uncertain future.  My delegation believes that this year’s theme of implementing a global partnership for development is timely and one which  if we work together  will enhance our economies in all of their aspects.  It is for that reason that  within our region  we have taken the necessary steps in response to the challenges we face by deepening our integration arrangements with the creation of the Caribbean Community Single Market and Economy. Recognizing the changing trends related to the movement of skills  Grenada has placed great emphasis on the economic    06-53615 12  empowerment of its young people  as well as on the creation of a more diverse and non-traditional job sector. Having lost much of our traditional agriculture through natural disasters and the changing global environment  we have been forced to create alternatives through global partnerships.  Since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration  we have encountered untold challenges in attempting to achieve the prescribed goals. As this body is well aware  Grenada  as one of the small States which hold membership in this Organization  has on many occasions relied not only on our immediate regional partners  but also on the wider membership and respective United Nations agencies during some very difficult and trying times. Our most recent past is not yet overcome  since we are still rebuilding our shattered economy following the devastation of two hurricanes in 2004 and 2005.   However  despite those challenges  we pledge to continue to work towards the achievement of some of the Millennium Development Goals. We have made significant strides in our efforts to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. along with improvements in education  poverty eradication and environmental sustainability.  Grenada has over the years worked closely and successfully with the United Nations agencies in our region. Therefore  we are hopeful that  during this session  no effort will be spared to ensure the sustainability of those agencies.  My delegation has on numerous occasions made reference to the unfortunate reality that special and differential treatment for small and vulnerable economies is fast becoming a thing of the past. We have seen decreases in financial and technical support from traditional partners  and a reduction in the market for trade in goods and services.  In that vein  the suspension of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations in July 2006 was a major setback for my country. International trade and reduction in poverty are inextricably linked to development. Greater market access for products from developing countries can lead to economic growth and higher standards of living. Grenada therefore looks forward to the resumption of those negotiations.  In the past few months  the United Nations has been encumbered with the task of maintaining peace and security in many parts of the world. My delegation commends the efforts made in that respect and welcomes the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission  which will assist States in the post-conflict era. We extend condolences to the families of those brave men and women who lost their lives in the service of the organization. Grenada is proud to be a police-contributing country with the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and looks forward to continuing its involvement in that area.  My delegation is well aware that this Organization will have to increase its efforts in combating terrorism  and welcomes the recently agreed Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy as a positive step in that regard.  Grenada makes it clear that it uncompromisingly condemns terrorism and all acts of violence  and pledges its full cooperation in combating that phenomenon. Though my delegation is supportive of those measures  as a small island developing State we are faced with serious financial and technical constraints in maintaining continued peace and security within our region. The measures we have implemented in that respect will be tested as we host the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the Caribbean.  My delegation  in applauding the creation of the Human Rights Council  is hopeful that the new body will be able through its work to ensure that democracy and good governance are observed in all their aspects. We fully support the Secretary- General’s sentiments that mainstreaming all human rights  including the right to development  is necessary  and support to Member States in their efforts to build stronger national systems for the promotion and protection of human rights is of extreme importance.  Grenada was indeed honoured to participate at the highest level in the launching of the new Central Emergency Response Fund earlier this year and to lend its support to the growth of the Fund. We commend the work of the Organization in that regard and are well aware of the importance of maintaining and supporting the Fund  especially since  globally  there has been an increase in natural and humanitarian disasters. We are pleased with the decision to expand the relationship outside of the membership to include the private  individual and non-governmental sectors.  We call on the international community to honour its responsibility and commitment to the full   13 06-53615  implementation of the Mauritius Strategy and to support programmes in our region related to early warning systems  the Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility  and vulnerability reduction  while at the same time building resilience.  My delegation has taken note of the resolution on development. However  we are disappointed that this aspect of the Summit Outcome has not progressed with the kind of vigour we would have welcomed. That is of special importance to countries like my own  since support for development objectives is paramount to our economic sustainability. We cannot fail to reiterate our vulnerability and call for swift action at this session in order to ensure the stability of our small societies.  My delegation salutes the Secretary-General’s efforts to strengthen the Organization through its engagement with civil society and other non-State actors  and agrees that they are important to the legitimacy of democratic ideals.  Grenada has increased its efforts to strengthen the relationship between Government and the private sector through partnerships in trade  education  health  tourism and investment activities  and has already seen positive results from this type of engagement  especially in the aftermath of the recent hurricanes.  2007 will mark the bicentenary of the passage of the act abolishing the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the British empire  and it is anticipated that the General Assembly will hold a commemorative event to mark that historic occasion. The members of the Caribbean Community will submit a draft resolution to the General Assembly  and we expect the full support of all Member States in that regard.  We  along with other members of the Caribbean Community  feel compelled on a regular basis to make the plea for special attention to be paid to the threat facing the Caribbean Sea. Grenada therefore takes this opportunity to reiterate its concerns over the transshipment of nuclear waste and other hazardous material through the marine environment of the Caribbean. The Caribbean Sea provides for us a lifeline  the potential loss of which could be enormous to our people’s livelihood. As we are well aware  loss of economic opportunities brings with it poverty and social unrest and ultimately threatens democracy — a solid tradition on which the Caribbean Community continues to pride itself. We therefore urge understanding and solidarity with our cause.  My delegation applauds the Organization for its work in the areas of reform and looks forward to the continuation of that process  especially in the areas of development  Economic and Social Council reform  Secretariat and management reform  Security Council reform  system-wide coherence  disarmament and non-proliferation  and other areas that have received only partial attention. Let us pursue with vigour our work in ensuring that this body finds ways not only to sustain  but to continue to build on the successes of its past achievements.  The many challenges that we all now face make it necessary that we work together to make the planet a better place for future generations. Let us  then  commit ourselves to cooperating with and supporting each other in the journey towards genuine development.  Finally  my delegation  having listened to the debate over the past few days  is heartened by the pledges of support and is convinced that  together  we can make it work to our collective benefit. Grenada is pleased to join in that pledge and looks forward to working with the Organization and its partners in attaining that goal. "
"70",2917,"GTM",61,2006,"In 2006  several important anniversaries coincide and provide a background for our debate. For the United Nations  2006 represents a new opportunity to assess progress since the adoption six years ago of the package of commitments generally known as the Millennium Development Goals  which received renewed impetus during the 2005 World Summit. The outcome of that summit provides the main theme of our debate during this Assembly  as well as the guidelines for the reform of our Organization. For this great city  the site of the Headquarters of our Organization  2006 marks the fifth anniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001  which altered history forever. For Guatemala  2006 marks the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Peace Accords that put an end to a bloody internal conflict lasting over four decades. For our Secretary-General  it marks the end of his 10-year term  which has had a highly positive result: a result that I want to acknowledge and for which I would like to thank him.  I will move on to address some of these substantial issues. But before doing so  I would like to state our appreciation of Mr. Jan Eliasson’s stewardship and exceptional leadership of the previous session of this Assembly. At the same time  we welcome your election  Madam President  and have no doubt that you will bring us to a safe port.  I should like to allude very briefly to four matters: compliance with the Guatemalan Peace Accords  a process in which the United Nations participated very closely; follow-up of the 2005 World Summit  especially Millennium Goal 8  namely  to foster a global partnership for development; our views on certain aspects of United Nations reform; and our views on certain positive developments that affect international relations.  The brief time allotted to me does not allow me to go into detail  but it is undeniable that we have advanced substantially in the direction of giving concrete expression to the vision contained in the Peace Accords. More to the point  if we contrast today’s Guatemala to that of 1996  we now have a society that is more plural  tolerant  deliberative and participative than in the past. Our representative democracy is taking root  after three free and transparent elections. The army is truly subordinated to    06-52885 2  the civil Government. Important progress has been achieved in strengthening a multi-ethnic and multilingual society. The State is committed to respecting of civil  political and human rights and to promoting greater participation of women in our society. Significant efforts have been in strengthening the administration of justice and consolidating the rule of law. The proportion of public expenditure assigned to the provision of social services has increased significantly in the past few years. We have assisted the victims of the conflict through a programme of reparation payments. We promote the National Front against Hunger as a priority of my Government. Likewise  we recently adopted a policy on rural development  which was prepared and will be implemented with the participation of entrepreneurs  peasants and trade unions.  At the same time  we recognize that much remains to be done. Human rights violations persist  often linked to an increase in crime  including organized crime. It is for this reason that we invited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to open an office in Guatemala and to join us in strengthening our own capacity to defend and protect vulnerable groups. We have also invited the United Nations to support an initiative to establish a commission to investigate illicit and clandestine groups. Furthermore  we have promoted domestic legislation to combat the scourge of crime  including the recently promulgated law against organized crime.  The commitments contained in the Peace Accords entail serious budgetary implications. To address them  we recently sent to Congress  and Congress approved  an act to combat tax evasion. At the same time  we have forged a broad consensus on an agreed tax package that ensures the financing of future development through improvements in the allocation and administration of public expenditures and the collection of taxes.  My Government assigns priority to the recognition of the identity and rights of indigenous peoples. In this regard  we trust that the General Assembly will soon adopt the Draft Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  which saw light in the Human Rights Council and which will contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  In summary  our Government Plan has embraced the Peace Accords and is committed nationally to complying with them. In 2005  a Framework Act on the Peace Accords was passed in order to strengthen the institutional aspects of the peace process. One of our goals is to achieve socio-economic development that is participatory and responds to the needs of the entire population.  This leads me to the second item  namely  the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Indeed  a major part of our Government programme is entirely consistent with those goals  especially with regard to combating poverty and hunger and achieving universal primary education. Our policies  which emphasize rural development  take an approach that favours the poorest strata of our society. The efforts undertaken have been based mostly on domestic resources — Government and civil society — but we have also received support from the international community in the context of a genuine partnership.  The international community’s respect for our priorities has grown  and it has increasingly adapted its methods to our budgetary procedures. From our country’s point of view  significant progress has been achieved since the International Conference on Financing for Development was held in 2002. We have also noted a reversal  over the past four years  in the earlier trend towards declining official development assistance (ODA). It is hoped that the new trend of increasing ODA will persist and accelerate  especially in favour of the least developed countries.  In contrast to the relatively encouraging picture in the area of financing for development  it is a source of great concern that the negotiations of the Doha Development Round have been suspended. That is a serious setback for the global economy and especially for the chances of developing countries to improve their participation in international trade.  If the potential of the Development Round is not salvaged  which must include the dismantling of agricultural subsidies as well as other restrictive practices of trade in agricultural products that persist among the main developed economies  it will be difficult to continue referring to a global partnership for development as posited by the Millennium Development Goals. In that regard  it is urgently necessary to renew the negotiations of the Doha Round under the aegis of the World Trade Organization. On that subject  we also support the strengthening of South-South cooperation in all areas.   3 06-52885   Moving on now to the third part of my remarks  we believe that the reforms undertaken at the United Nations since 2000  and in particular since the 2005 Summit  have been significant and headed in the right direction. We identify with the new Human Rights Council  of which we are a member  and support the fulfilment of its role in promoting and protecting human rights at the global level.  We also understand the considerable potential of the new Peacebuilding Commission to contribute to the joint work of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council for the benefit of countries now in post-conflict situations. We promote the revitalization and strengthening of the General Assembly as the only universal body with enough legitimacy to debate and adopt policies  as prescribed by the Charter and as agreed in the Millennium Declaration and at the 2005 Summit.  We reiterate our strong support for the Economic and Social Council as a meeting place to foster sustainable development. We especially applaud the decision to convene a high-level meeting on development cooperation every two years. We add our voices to all the others urging an end to the stalemate in the discussions on Security Council reform. The parameters of that debate are well known. For our part  we have historically favoured a moderate expansion in the number of non-permanent members  but more recently  we have signalled that we could support any formula that would be capable of bringing about a consensus  including the expansion of members in both categories. We also support a more representative  transparent and effective Council.  We are candidates for a non-permanent seat on the Council for the biennium 2007-2008  because we believe that our experience as a country that made the transition from conflict to peace and democracy provides us with insights that would contribute to the work of the Council. In addition  we are one of the few original signatories of the Charter that have not yet had the opportunity to serve in the work of that body. If elected to the Security Council  we commit ourselves to carrying out our responsibilities in a professional  responsible and dignified manner — in the representation of our region — and also to promote from within the reform of that crucial forum for assuring peace and stability in the world.  My country’s foreign policy is in accordance with our national interests based on improved participation by Guatemala in the globalized world  as well as the strengthening of multilateralism and regional integration. We have promoted a deeper integration with our immediate neighbours in Central America  and important progress in the establishment of a customs union has been achieved. We  the five Central American countries  have also agreed on a free trade agreement with the United States of America  and in 2007  will begin negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union.  Moreover  my Government has endeavoured to deepen its bilateral relations with Belize  while at the same time seeking to find a definitive  just  equitable and honourable solution to the territorial dispute between our countries. Thus  on 7 September 2005  we signed  under the auspices of the Organization of American States  an Agreement on a Framework for Negotiations and Confidence-Building Measures  which covers a wide range of subjects and will bring us closer. One of the tangible results of that effort has been a free trade agreement signed just a few months ago.  Guatemala participated actively in the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development held in this same Hall less than a week ago. In that context  we emphasize that attention to the situation of Guatemalan migrants is another priority of my Government. An essential element of the public policy on that subject is full respect for the human rights of all migrants  an element which will only be fulfilled when all States become parties to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.  My Government is working with the recipient countries  in particular with the United States of America  to promote comprehensive migration reform that would include mechanisms to manage the supply of workers in the countries of origin and the demand for workers in the recipient countries. That would help regularize the situation of emigrants  whose contribution to the well-being of their communities is substantial  and would make it possible to overcome the great vulnerability of our population.  We feel solidarity with other countries that have endured under conflict situations. This is why we have taken part in an increasing number of United Nations    06-52885 4  peacekeeping operations. We are proud of our presence  along with many other Latin American countries  in our neighbour Haiti  and we celebrate the democratically elected Government of President René Préval. We also have troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and military observers in six other countries in the African continent.  We deplore the violence that has affected several countries in the Middle East  in particular Lebanon. We call for a solution that will allow Israel and a sovereign Palestinian State to live in peace within safe borders in the wider context of a region that finds its own destiny in harmony and progress.  Given the importance of coordination among States of the region  Guatemala organized  from 11 to 13 September 2006  the first regional security meeting of Central America and the Dominican Republic  with the goal of achieving a consensus among the countries of the Central American group  as well as Mexico  Colombia  Belize and the Dominican Republic  to develop a comprehensive strategy and to counteract the main threats to the area  a consensus to unify the security policies and procedures already agreed and contained in multilateral regional and international agreements  treaties and conventions  as well as those adopted at summit meetings. We hope we can continue to count on the support of the international community and of the United Nations to organize three more meetings to complete the development of that strategy.  It is important to emphasize that Guatemala is organizing  jointly with Transparency International  the 12th International Anti-Corruption Conference  from 15 to 18 November this year. The theme for the conference will be “Towards a fairer world: Why is corruption still blocking the way?” This effort reflects my Government’s firm commitment to fight the scourge of corruption that has corroded our institutions for many years and has prevented our citizens from making the transition to a more just country. On that note  you are all welcome  and we are eager to share our challenges  progress and difficulties in this common struggle.  Under your leadership  Madam President  at this session the General Assembly will have to address issues of great importance for humanity and for our Organization. Guatemala pledges to participate actively in the debates planned for this year. From this moment on  we offer you our full cooperation for the success of your presidency. "
"71",2960,"GUY",61,2006,"Just about a month ago  the people of Guyana went to the polls to vote for the Government of their choice. Witnessed by an unprecedented number of observers drawn from several countries and international organizations  including the United Nations  the elections were deemed to be free  fair and transparent. With a renewed mandate  the Government led by President Bharrat Jagdeo  has recommitted itself to the pursuit of democratic governance at home and to a progressive foreign policy abroad.  I am pleased  on behalf of the Government and the people of Guyana to convey to the President of the Assembly our warmest congratulations on her election and to wish her much success during her term of office. To her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  I would like to express our appreciation and thanks for directing the work of the Assembly this past year with considerable expertise and aplomb. And to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who demits his post later this year  I wish to offer our sincere gratitude for his impressive leadership of the United Nations during an uncertain and challenging period. He leaves with our best wishes for his future health and happiness.  As a fledgling democracy  Guyana is proud to be part of the family of free nations. We are dedicated to the creation of a society based on equity and social justice that guarantees to all our citizens their fundamental freedoms and rights. To this end  we have enshrined in our Constitution provisions for the full enjoyment of these entitlements. In the same spirit  we have acceded to the many international treaties and conventions that embody agreements on the rights of peoples. Article 154 A of our Constitution guarantees that “such rights embodied in these international instruments shall be respected and upheld by the executive  legislature  judiciary and all organizations and agencies of Government”. We are thus fully committed to international cooperation for global peace and development.  The President of the Assembly is to be commended for proposing for discussion by this Assembly the topic “Implementing the global partnership for development”. Ever since its establishment in 1945  the United Nations has laboured to produce an effective development strategy. Decade after decade  several proposals were laboriously drafted  only to be quickly relegated to the archives. It was not surprising  therefore  that countries  especially the developing nations  eventually became disillusioned owing to the little that was achieved.  The World Hearings on Development that were held during Guyana’s presidency of the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session sought a new approach to the issue of development by bringing together all the relevant actors — distinguished world leaders  member Governments  the private sector  non-governmental organizations and other elements of civil society — to analyse deficiencies in international cooperation. What was needed  it was said  was a new development architecture  not a tinkering with the old.  Following up on the promise of these hearings  the General Assembly proceeded in 1997 to elaborate an agenda for development. There could be no more comprehensive and compelling document than that. Yet  it too was soon buried and forgotten. By the year 2000  the international community had decided that enough was enough and that instead of forging yet another declaration it would set for itself certain precise and time-bound goals.   Our pursuit of these Millennium Development Goals thus far has shown that while our efforts may indeed lift some countries out of poverty  significant and sustainable development will be achieved only through the international cooperation required in Goal 8. It is worthy of note that  while there are clear measurements of progress under Goals 1 to 7  no well-defined indicators exist for Goal 8 — the global partnership for development — an omission that clearly limits the effort at cooperation and creates an imbalance in the partnership.  If I have delved into the history of the development challenge  it is not to dwell on the past  but rather to draw from it lessons that may help us in the future to translate our long-held aspirations into early reality. Allow me  therefore  to offer some thoughts on how the global partnership for development may be strengthened.     06-53615 20   As was determined at Monterrey  partnership  coherence and accountability are vital to the fulfilment of our development goals. Without close and genuine cooperation between donors and recipients  there is not likely to be significant progress. At the national level countries should own their development strategies  while at the international level there should be greater coordination and consistency of support in the trade  monetary and financial systems. Much too often it is the developing countries that are scrutinized and scolded for their shortcomings  while their developed partners are considered above blame. True partnership requires mutual accountability. Accordingly  we would propose that there should be some verification of donor pledges and periodic reviews of performance on both sides.  Implementation of the global partnership would be greatly facilitated if the task were to be seen in terms of mutual benefit and not of charity or obligation. Both sides must be involved in the decision-making process in all cooperation agreements. Such participation would produce a greater sense of ownership by the developing countries and  consequently  a deeper sense of commitment to execution. At the recent World Bank/IMF meeting held in Singapore and chaired by the President of Guyana  the IMF Managing Director is reported to have proposed a rearrangement of quotas that would enable developing countries to be more involved in decision-making. Although the change cannot be considered as comprehensive as necessary  it is  nonetheless  a first step toward more democratic governance in the management of development.   Furthermore  given the inadequacy of resources that have been available thus far for development  we must endeavour to identify  as we pledged in Monterrey  new and additional sources of financing. The Millennium Challenge Account and the International Finance Facility have been welcome attempts to provide fresh funding. More recently  at the initiative of France  Brazil and others a tax on air travel has been proposed — and implemented by some countries — and promises to provide substantial revenues to support development. Similar proposals  such as the Tobin tax  a tax on pollution and a low-elasticity commodities tax  are on the table. What is needed now is a serious evaluation of these suggestions to determine their feasibility for implementation by the international community.  Implementation of the global partnership undoubtedly suffers from the “beggar-thy-neighbour” attitude that exists in international economic and trade relations. As evidenced in the recent Doha Development Round negotiations  the predominant interests of the developed countries in such areas as agriculture  subsidies and services have effectively denied developing nations  more particularly the small and vulnerable  any prospect of significant participation in the global economy. Without expanded trade opportunities  investment and a comprehensive framework of support  development for many countries will continue to be elusive. We need  therefore  to ensure that the Doha Development Round is revived and that broad assistance is provided to serve the purposes of development.  An increasingly formidable challenge to implementing the development agenda is the spread of transboundary crime  including arms and drug trafficking  which has reached new and alarming levels that cripple economic growth. Governments can ill afford the resources needed to fight the drug lords  who are themselves endowed with considerable assets and artillery. Unfortunately  whatever assistance is provided by donor countries and relevant agencies is woefully inadequate to deal with the onslaught. This growing insurgency can be counteracted only by greater determination on the part of the United Nations system to collaborate fully to crush transboundary crime. Our developed partners therefore need to do more to assist in the fight against this scourge.  A more serious inhibitor to economic growth and social progress is the current unsettled international political climate  in which recourse to conflict is seen as a ready means of settling international issues. The egregious examples of Iraq and Lebanon  where force has been used to achieve political aims and objectives  have clearly shown that violence solves nothing. Indeed  the havoc and destruction wrought by war seriously diminish the prospects for development  whether in the Middle East or elsewhere. The agenda for peace cannot be implemented without due regard to the agenda for development.  The Government of Guyana has long been persuaded of the need for a new global human economic and social order that is capable of delivering true democracy and social justice to all peoples. First posited in 1994 at the World Summit on Social Development by the late President Jagan of Guyana    21 06-53615  the concept is premised on a comprehensive and holistic approach to development aimed at achieving more inclusive economic and social progress. The new global human order initiative  which is already being considered by this Organization and has been supported by many Member States  seeks to create a consensus on a new model of development that would be based on genuine partnership among States and a joint endeavour to secure peace and prosperity for all.  No less formidable and challenging to the development agenda than the international political and economic environment is the fragile ecosystem in which we now live. We have all witnessed the increasing number of earthquakes  floods  tropical storms and hurricanes  which cause catastrophic damage wherever they occur. Less than two years ago  my own country was struck by a flood  resulting in damage equivalent to 60 per cent of our gross domestic product. It would be foolish — perhaps fatal — if we did not prepare ourselves to anticipate and withstand such disasters. Early-warning systems should be established across the globe and financial resources made available to the United Nations fund to facilitate early responses and recovery. In short  disaster mitigation should now become an integral part of the development agenda.  Experience has taught us that development is a complex and complicated phenomenon  and that the many challenges we now face are such that they cannot be overcome without full international cooperation. Yet our responses continue to be ad hoc and woefully inadequate to deal with the resolution of the problems that we are confronting. The development agenda has now become more extensive and is very urgent. With courage and vision  we must renew our commitment to the implementation of the global partnership for development. Our common humanity and  indeed  a common sense of decency and morality  demand no less. "
"72",3005,"HND",61,2006,"I feel very honoured to be the emissary of the Honduran people  who send to all at this General Assembly brotherly  warm and effusive greetings on the occasion of the sixty-first session of the Assembly.  We come here today before the representatives of the nations of the world to merge the larger part of our dreams and hopes in order  together  to achieve the greatest goals for world peace. Our high aspirations  along with the worthiness of the members of the Assembly  are part of humanity’s common purpose of attaining international law and justice.  But we also have to recognize that there are things that are difficult to understand in an environment that is supposed to be conducive to peace and development: the contrast we see among different latitudes of the Earth; the immense needs of peoples; the contrast of poverty; drums of war that resound everywhere; nuclear threats; cruel situations for nations and peoples.  Rather than narrowing  social divides have grown wider in recent decades. Morality is not being combined with economy or science. Morality is moving away from the principles and values of a just and true God. That is why our presence in this important Assembly is needed to focus clearly on the fact that humanity needs to seek its objectives according to healthy principles that will dignify our peoples.  When the last half of the twentieth century came to an end  we sincerely believed that we had put an end to political  ideological and religious tyrannies. But today we see them cropping up again  together with the tyrannies of trade  which are often more cruel than the others. Today  they want to sell us a free-market policy  but ultimately that is a ruthless  insensitive economic policy that is protectionist for many sectors. Instead of opening the door to a social approach to the market  where freedom is for people  we only have freedom for investment  and we forget about individuals and citizens and the rights of women and children  the most vulnerable groups who  although lacking in power  yearn for a better life.    06-52737 16   Certainly  we need to have protection  but not just protection for investments and big capital. We also need protection for the vulnerable of the world: for children and young people  for farmers who sow their small plots; for those businesspeople who cannot get a foothold on the ladder of international trade; for the owners of microenterprises who are reaching out in search for the well-being and dignity they deserve.  All of us  of course  want a free market  but an ethical one. We want to live in a globalized world — but one in which respect for identity  patriotism and the dignity and sovereignty of peoples are also global. So we are here to denounce hypocrisy  double-talk and moral double standards on the part of those who proclaim and promote a solution to our problems through democracy and free trade  but who seize and hold hostage the concepts of internal and external spaces and promote a system of privileges  oligopolies and monopolies  half-truths and flawed markets that they hold captive. They are insensitive to the demands of the majority  very often tortured by hunger  unemployment  indifference and exclusion.  We have come to this Assembly to wish everyone the best  but also to point the finger at those who preach false free trade that only deepens poverty and seek to seduce us with the erratic mirage of remittances that we so easily accept but which in fact are the fruit of a labour force that we have exported; the result of the cruel fate of our emigrants; the inexorable and evil tragedy of people caught between freedom  marginalization and slavery.  My Government and the people of Honduras condemn the monopolistic controls  the privileges and the absurd exceptions that prevent us from building true freedom with democracy and market access  the paradigm that we all want to move towards without the protectionism we all condemn.  The Governments of the world must be led by men and women who long for peace and not by multinational corporations that promote war. Here  civil society organizations could play a major role in correcting this situation and denouncing it.  I represent Honduras  a country of the Isthmus of Central America  and  like our Central American brothers and sisters  we continue to face the innumerable paradoxes that arise between civilization and barbarism. We have been the historical theatre of absurd wars  ambitions and sterile battles  very often exported  and the horrors of death and pillage. Yet the peoples of Central America are in the vanguard of those looking for joint solutions. We have the creative capacity that keeps us from losing faith or hope in a better world.  America has been inspired throughout history by great men and women of renown. Here in North America  Lincoln was a splendid guide for democracy. In the South  it was Sucre  San Martín and Bolívar; José Martí in the Caribbean; Villa and Zapata in Mexico. And in Central America  we have Jerez  Mora  Valle  Darío  Turcios  Omar Torrijos and the pro-union martyr Francisco Morazán  among others. The Chilean poet  Pablo Neruda  Nobel laureate for literature  said it well:  “Deep in the night Morazán is watchful.  Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know the answer   Central ribbon  slender America   ...  Raised up on emerald sea-feathers:  Territory  unity  slim goddess  Born in the water-foam battle.  They destroy your sons  and worms  Spread their pestilence over you.  ...  Now comes the axe-brandishing tiger.  They come to devour your entrails.  They come  fragrant little America   To nail you to the cross  to flay you   To cast down the metal blazoned on your banner.  Invaders fill your dwelling-place  And toss you aside like lifeless fruit   ...  And others plunder your ports ...  Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know the answer.  Brothers  awaken. And Morazán is watchful.”  We  the Central American peoples  stand tall  ready to take the opportunities offered by development and genuine free trade  seeking our common destiny  seeking it today — which is not the end of history  but the beginning of a new era for humanity  if we shoulder our responsibility and commitment. We have not lost our desire for liberty or our longing for hope. We continue to fight for food security  for energy independence  for the social morality that we all   17 06-52737  deserve and for an economy that is at the service of markets  yes  but also at the service of people. We form a common front against poverty and against the corruption which today is invading our culture at many levels. Unless we overcome this  we cannot win genuine sovereignty.  Central America opens itself to the world so that the world can open itself to Central America. We are prepared for investment in tourism and in various areas of our economy and society. We are ready in Central America — El Salvador  Guatemala  Nicaragua  Costa Rica  Panama  Belize and now the Dominican Republic. We represent this central waistband of America  this bridge of trade and markets — a bridge to a free world  a better world.  Time limitations prevent me from addressing all the other important topics. Allow me to conclude this brief statement by expressing wishes for true peace and opportunity for everyone  in the conviction that the peoples of the world can exist only when in the heart of man there is fear of the wisdom of God.  Let us all say yes to the loving God  to that God that considers man a brother to man and not an enemy of man — to that God of non-violence. That is the God we hymn and glorify  and we in Central America and Honduras join together in a song of hope:  “Is it today? Yesterday? Tomorrow? You know the answer.  Brothers  awaken. And Morazán is watchful.” "
"73",3030,"HRV",61,2006,"At the outset  allow me to join other delegations in congratulating the President of the General Assembly on her election and to express my deep conviction that  under her skilful leadership  this session will achieve remarkable results.  Allow me also to extend my country’s sentiments of deepest appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His relentless work for a better world has been most remarkable. Leading the United Nations for 10 years in very sensitive times  his achievements  humanism  vision and initiatives have crucially contributed to the Organization. That has been recognized worldwide. I wish him all the best in his future engagements and thank him.  We live in a fragile world — a world disturbed and unsettled  a world that is marked by conflicts  controversies and confrontations of an entirely new nature. The architecture and mindsets of yesterday’s world are giving way to a web of new challenges. Yesterday  it was all about blocs  ideologies  the cold war and appeasement. Today  it is all about ethnicity  conflicts  burning regions  colliding religions  mass destruction  terror and poverty.  Today  international order is marked by three extremely demanding and global challenges: global tensions  global imbalances and global constraints. In that triangle  we need to strive to deliver sustainable solutions. Our responsibility is enormous — indeed  even as we seek to ensure global opportunities  freedom and shared values  this new world in the making is in danger of lapsing into mistrust  disagreements and divisions.  We live in a world of extraordinary inequalities in opportunity  but our world is also a global and interdependent one  where a broad sharing of economic and political opportunities could serve as an effective instrument for economic growth and development. In so doing  we can start turning the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals  into action.  My country is aware that a greater mobilization of domestic resources in developing countries is a necessity. Croatia has made significant progress in creating an enabling environment for partnership and innovation. Tremendous changes have taken place in the development of a market economy  changing ownership structures  creating a business environment  and reforms in the public and private sector. Above all  Croatia has progressed in ensuring domestic democratic stability and a prosperous international position as a framework for long-term development.  Croatia supports the commitments to the goals and targets deriving from the United Nations summits in Monterrey and Johannesburg  and the related processes  such as the Doha Development Agenda and the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. We also support the emphasis on achieving the targets in developed countries for official development assistance based on actual needs — rising from today’s 0.33 per cent of gross national income to at least 0.51 per cent by 2010 and 0.7 per cent by 2015 — to meet the Millennium Development Goals and each country’s absorption capacity. We recognize that mobilizing financial resources for development and the effective use of those resources in developing countries are central to a global partnership for development.  Still  simply raising the level of official development assistance is not enough to enable the international community to fulfil its obligations towards the countries in need. It is also necessary to contribute to a more equitable distribution of aid that  unfortunately  quite often remains outside the regular economic and financial flows. Croatia also welcomes initiatives to enhance the quality of aid and to increase its impact  bearing in mind the fact that progress both for donors and for partner countries can be facilitated by the harmonization efforts at the international and regional levels. Therefore  we stress the need for an integrated approach among international institutions.    06-52885 38   Croatia recognizes the needs of Africa  especially sub-Saharan Africa and the least developed and landlocked developing States  as well as the special vulnerabilities of small island developing States. We are therefore pleased that those groups of countries received specific reference in the Outcome Document of 2005  thus emphasizing their particular needs and circumstances. The less fortunate must not be left behind. Special attention should be given to countries emerging from wars and undergoing a costly  complex and highly demanding post-conflict management process.  Croatia strongly supports yesterday’s official launching of the International Drug Purchase Facility initiative. We see it as a significant step forward and express our hopes that all countries will render their contribution.  As a contributor to various United Nations programmes and funds  my country confirms its capacity to support the activities of the United Nations in numerous fields. We will increasingly continue to do so. During the past few years  Croatia has started to contribute voluntarily to a number of United Nations activities  programmes and bodies: the United Nations Children’s Fund  the United Nations Trust Fund for African Development and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  to mention but a few. Being a small country  Croatia has limited financial and human resources  but that will not hinder us from sharing  helping and assisting.  Global economic and human development must remain in our focus  but as we meet today  the focus is very much on global tensions and instability. Today  many ongoing regional crises continue to cause great humanitarian tragedies around the world  seriously destabilizing regional and global security. Those arcs of instability are creating a network of fear and anger across many parts of the world. Terrorism is taking on new dimensions and forms. Weapons of mass destruction are yet another cause of grave concern. Economic imbalances and social impediments are becoming new sources of instability across the world. Religious divisions and misunderstandings add a new and dangerous dimension to insecurity in the world.  The significant growth of international terrorism has caused an unhealthy atmosphere of mistrust  religious and cultural intolerance  and grave infringements of human rights. Those consequences have in time developed into their own separate and extremely dangerous problems that exponentially threaten already fragile international relations.  The Republic of Croatia  as a member of the global anti-terrorist coalition  strongly condemns international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and  bearing in mind the ever-evolving threat of terrorism — especially weapons of mass destruction and cyber-terrorism — calls for even stronger global cooperation in the suppression of that modern-day scourge.  We must prove to our nations that we will stay firm and united against terrorism. In that light  a strong commitment to achieving a global consensus on a definition of terrorism and a final adoption of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism are very much needed and would reaffirm the central role of the United Nations in the suppression of terrorism. It that respect  we welcome the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  launched yesterday  and express our hope that all countries will implement it.  The Republic of Croatia has established very good cooperation with the United Nations  especially the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee and its Executive Directorate. Additionally  on 15 and 16 May  a Monitoring Team for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) visited Croatia and met with representatives of all relevant Government bodies involved in the suppression of terrorism.  Year by year  we continue our great cooperation with the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna  which has resulted in a recently held national expert workshop on international cooperation in criminal matters related to terrorism  organized through our joint cooperation in June this year in Valbandon  Croatia.  Weapons of mass destruction and a common approach to non-proliferation must remain our focus. Responsibility for world peace and security must continue to be the key guideline in dealing with that grave challenge. The rules and standards must be globally accepted and the United Nations and its specialized institutions and agencies must continue to play a pivotal role.   39 06-52885   My country won its liberty only a decade ago. Aggression and crises in our part of Europe presented the entire international community with a new challenge at that time. Regional conflicts emerged as the new and disturbing roots of new dangers to international peace  and they remain a challenge in many parts of the world. In that light  stability and peace in South-East Europe and post-conflict management and cooperation must be viewed as a success for the international community and the countries involved.  My country played and continues to play a prominent and leading role in providing for long-term stability  cooperation and democratic development for all of South-East Europe  based on the commonly shared vision of a new  united and secure Europe. Already negotiating future full membership in the European Union  and based on the progress of reforms in the military and the security sector — as well as standing at the threshold of NATO membership — Croatia is today an anchor of stability  security and cooperation. Croatia is therefore an indispensable partner in the historical transformation of that often-troubled and critically important region for European and world peace  transforming it into a zone of modern society and democratic standards and values.  Croatia’s specific position as a Central European  Danubian and Mediterranean country provides added value in bilateral and multilateral contacts and experience  stemming from its participation in numerous global  European and regional organizations and initiatives in the fields of security  democratic development and economic cooperation  including Croatia’s current presidency of the South-East European Cooperation Process.  Stability  democratic development and cooperation  as well as the resolution of remaining open issues and completing the security architecture of that part of Europe  will also have to be closely linked to the indispensability of the protection and promotion of universal values  the rule of law  human rights and democracy  as well as their interrelationship with security and development.  Croatia supports efforts to accelerate democracy’s movement around the world  particularly through such intergovernmental organizations as the Community of Democracies. Last year  as a signatory of the Warsaw Declaration of the Community of Democracies  the Republic of Croatia contributed to the founding of the United Nations Democracy Fund to reaffirm its commitment to encouraging other countries on their path to democratization.  Croatia welcomes the fact that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has begun work on its first cases. We attach great importance to the continuation of the ICC’s successful work. Croatia also welcomes the fact that the number of States parties to the Rome Statute has reached and surpassed 100  and we hope that the number will continue to rise. The Republic of Croatia also supports the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in pursuing its completion strategy. Croatia continues to fully cooperate with the ICTY as part of our own advancement towards the rule of law  and also as an indicator and impetus for the region  with the aim of overcoming the legacy of the recent past in South-East Europe.  The Republic of Croatia has been a member of numerous United Nations bodies and very active in organizing and hosting conferences and other multilateral activities. My country is now ready to take the next step in strengthening our responsibility as a Member of the United Nations. For that reason  the Republic of Croatia has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2008-2009 at the elections to be held in 2007.  Croatia recognizes the importance of global multilateralism  as well as the growing significance of regional organizations in tackling the challenges of today’s world. The role of the United Nations in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the achievement of the development goals agreed by the international community must remain fundamental  pivotal and re-energized. We also welcome the strengthening of coordination within the United Nations system  in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial  trade and development institutions  in order to support sustained economic growth and sustainable development.  Allow me to refer to one of the messages of the Outcome Document of last year’s Summit — namely  the notion that there will be no development without security and no security without development. We acknowledge that peace and security  development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system and the basis of our collective security and    06-52885 40  well-being. We recognize that development  peace  security and human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. In facing that challenge  the United Nations system is called on to play an enhanced development role.  Croatia welcomes the inauguration of the Human Rights Council and considers it to be a milestone for the global promotion of human rights. My country also welcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  which arose from the need for a coordinated and integrated approach to post-conflict peacebuilding.  My country is pleased to have been elected to the Peacebuilding Commission in May  and I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the States that voted for us and placed their confidence in Croatia. Our wish is to contribute actively to the United Nations system of collective security in an effective and transparent way  as embodied in the Charter and aligned with the Millennium Declaration.  Croatia welcomes another visible result of the efforts to reform the United Nations — the establishment of the Human Rights Council as the main standing body of the United Nations on human rights.  Now  allow me to share some remarks on one of the most important tasks we need to address.  In this fragile world  the need for an efficient and democratic world body is ever increasing. The Summit of heads of State and Government held in 2005 provided us with a platform for further action toward the reform of our Organization. There has been noted progress on several important reform issues  but we cannot be satisfied with the pace of the process. My country believes that the reform of the Organization and of the Security Council must justly take account of the interests of all. Croatia advocates the enlargement of the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership  based on appropriate regional representation in which the Eastern European Group would have two non-permanent seats. It is of the utmost importance in a new  enlarged Council to have an appropriate number of representatives of the developing countries of the South and better representation of small and medium-sized countries.  Additionally  the reform of the Council should extend to its working methods and its interaction with other principal bodies of the Organization  first and most importantly the Economic and Social Council. That would strengthen the United Nations in a wide range of areas  including peace and security  development and human rights. There is also a need to improve United Nations management practices and working methods to raise the whole system to a higher level of transparency and accountability.   Mindful that peace and security are prerequisites for economic and social prosperity  Croatia would like to remain engaged in and responsive to current concerns on reforming the United Nations system in order to make it a stronger and more effective Organization for times to come. That is our common responsibility. We need to act today in order to prepare ourselves in a timely manner for the challenges of tomorrow.  Although one third of the entire Millennium Development Goals period is already behind us  the targets set are  regrettably  not being met at the desired pace. That must be changed as a matter of urgency  as it is undoubtedly an issue affecting the future security and stability of the world. We must move forward in assisting developing countries and other countries in need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  As I mentioned at the outset of my address  Croatia has presented its candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term 2008-2009  the elections for which are to be held in 2007. I feel the need to stress that Croatia’s candidacy is  above all  a measure of Croatia’s responsibility.  I have mentioned the fragility of today’s world. I have not mentioned the fragility  uncertainties and challenges that Croatia experienced in the recent past. They are well known  but at the same time they are the source of our understanding of and responsiveness to the needs of a fragile world. We believe that we can contribute to building a new cooperative world in responding to our new challenges and to enhancing our Organization. Croatian membership in the Security Council would also serve as a telling demonstration of the success of the peace process in South-East Europe.  My country went through a successful transition from being a country receiving peacekeeping forces to one that is now a contributor to 11 of the 18 United Nations peacekeeping operations in various regions   41 06-52885  throughout the world. Croatia also provides training and hosts international courses in the field of peacebuilding. We are therefore well aware of the added value that countries that have rebuilt their national capacities bring to the credibility of such an important body for the cause of international peace  security and development. Croatia stands determined to continue to support peace efforts and a strengthened United Nations role on a regional and global level. "
"74",3075,"HTI",61,2006,"I am honoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the Government and people of Haiti. Allow me  first  to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly in its sixty-first session. I am convinced that her wealth of legal training  her profound knowledge of public affairs  her national and international career and her keen negotiating skills mean that this session will be a success. Allow me to reiterate to the President the full support of my country and of the Haitian delegation in discharging her lofty tasks.  I wish also to congratulate Ambassador Jan Eliasson  whose practical spirit  his sense of compromise and great know-how  meant that the sixtieth session was a successful one. I wish him every success in his new job as his country’s Minister for Foreign Affairs.   I wish to convey to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  sincere thanks for the skill with which he has conducted the Organization over the past 10 years. I congratulate him also on his continued commitment to my country. The people of Haiti is profoundly grateful to him for his subtlety and determination demonstrated in the quest for viable lasting solutions to the long crisis that has beset my country in recent years. Mr. Annan deserves the full appreciation of the international community for his laudable  indefatigable efforts for peace  justice  human rights  democracy and development.  On 3 July 2006  the Republic of Haiti regained its seat in the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM)  thus putting an end to an absence of two long years. We recognize that during this period our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean never lost interest in Haiti’s affairs. Quite the contrary: they were strongly committed to finding appropriate solutions  which have allowed my country today to have the honour to participate side by side with them in the great debates concerning the region. On 11 September  Haiti finally rejoined the great family of the Non-Aligned Movement  whose purpose is to strengthen South-South cooperation. This was most welcome. Those two events clearly show that we want to be open to the world.   I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the accession of the Republic of Montenegro to political sovereignty and to the great family of our Organization.  Today  more than ever before  our world is facing manifold threats that imperil its very existence. Despite the Organization’s intensive efforts to make the world more human and more liveable  the spectre of major pandemics  poverty  hunger  organized crime  terrorism  armed conflict  civil war and natural disasters continues to haunt us. We therefore need to redouble our efforts to refine our diplomatic approaches and to give priority to dialogue  honest  open negotiations  flexibility and compromise. Those principles lie at the very basis of the creation of the United Nations and reaffirm its strength and its raison d’être. Our Organization remains the ideal forum  the reference point for finding appropriate solutions to the problems that beset our world. Nothing should make us abandon that spirit.  The Republic of Haiti unreservedly supports all of the international community’s initiatives to resolve conflicts in Africa  in East Asia and in the Middle East by finding peaceful negotiated solutions respectful of the sovereignty of States.    06-53958 6   Terrorism is today assuming apocalyptic proportions. The attacks of 11 September 2001 against targets in the United States and subsequent attacks elsewhere in the world were wake-up calls to us  forcing us to silence our petty interests in order to face this scourge which  unless it is swiftly curbed  will lead to catastrophes with untold consequences. We cannot make mistakes and we cannot hesitate. Recently  we have been impotent  as we witness an infernal cycle of violence  massive destruction of innocent human lives and property. We are seeing attempts to annihilate our institutions and our society. The very future of humanity seems to be taken hostage by unbridled groups that stop at nothing to destroy wherever they can. The Republic of Haiti reaffirms once more its resolve to fight terrorism in all its forms  using the few resources that it has. It supports the preventive measures taken against terrorism  measures taken in a legal context. We encourage States to agree on a global convention on terrorism based on a clear definition acceptable to all.  Haiti welcomes the major steps taken to reform the United Nations at the previous session. We are still far from our goals  but some very significant progress has  nonetheless  been made. We hope that the changes decided on will continue to give our Organization the resources it needs to carry out its global vocation. We must adapt to new requirements  as we reaffirmed at the World Summit of 2005. Accordingly  I applaud the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission. It should play an important part and its purpose is political stability  creating sustainable foundations for socioeconomic development in post-conflict situations  as well as to help strengthen democratic institutions and make them effective in a constitutional framework and under the rule of law.   Similarly  I also welcome General Assembly resolution 60/251  which created the Human Rights Council. I congratulate the 47 members of the Council  who were elected in May in order to put their experience to use in promoting and protecting human rights. I hope that this new body will  in many respects  help to develop our society  to make it more open to dialogue  understanding  mutual respect  social justice and tolerance.   Haiti also welcomes the creation of the Central Emergency Relief Fund. It will provide upfront resources to enable the United Nations to finance humanitarian relief operations  as soon as a catastrophe occurs  in other words  to do more  faster.   My Government agrees with the idea of revitalizing the Economic and Social Council. As one of the main organs of the Organization  it should be more involved in development activities in countries that have been sidelined by history  especially the least developed countries (LDCs). It should provide greater cohesion in adopting the best approach for attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The question of harmonizing strategies and actions among the entities of the United Nations system that work in the area of development is  for us  a crucial one.   Through the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council  my country enjoys the support of the Council and  recently  at the high-level substantive meeting held in Geneva last July  the Council extended the mandate of that group through July 2007  with the possibility of being renewed once more. I welcome the idea that this extension will enable various sectors involved in the sustained development of Haiti to achieve tangible results for my country.   Since 1945  date of the creation of the United Nations  of which my country was a founding Member  the international landscape has undergone profound change. However  after more than sixty years  the institutional framework of the Security Council has remained the same. Any reform of the Organization would  therefore  be incomplete were it not to include a reorganization of the Security Council. The composition of the Security Council must  therefore  reflect the realities of the twenty-first century and include Member States that are capable of shouldering responsibilities of area of the maintenance of international peace and security. In this new desirable configuration  it is crucial that developing countries from Asia  Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean enjoy equitable representation.   In February 2006  Haiti held historic  fair and democratic elections. This process will be completed at the end of the year by municipal elections and territorial elections  which will help restore democracy and open the way to political stability. The people of Haiti as a whole decided in favour of change capable of giving it security and improved living conditions. I welcome the activities of the international community for the support and assistance it gave and has continued   7 06-53958  to give to Haiti. I salute the Group of Friends of Haiti and all Members of the Organization that have spared no effort or sacrifice to support the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) by providing it with military or police personnel.   I also welcome the adoption of Security Council resolution 1702 (2006) of 15 August 2006  which renewed the mandate of MINUSTAH. I hope that this mission  which is doing a very difficult job — sometimes a dangerous  but noble job — will  together with the national police of Haiti and the Government  manage to control the wanton insecurity that is besetting Haitian society. I therefore call upon the mission to work closely with the Haitian authorities to make the necessary changes depending on the priorities of the moment.   I hope that international assistance will also focus on reforming the judicial system  on the professionalization of the police and on strengthening democratic institutions  such as the parliament  municipal bodies and the territorial collectives.  To the parents  friends and colleagues of peaceworkers who died in Haiti in the line of duty  I would like to reiterate the pain and sorrow of our Government and the Haitian people  who recognize the importance of the United Nations presence in Haiti  the ultimate goal of which is to help the country to recover its stability.   The new team that the head of State of Haiti  Mr. René Garcia Préval  has the privilege of leading since he assumed office in May  has embarked on the long-term task of rebuilding the country. The task is to restore security  to build a modern State  to strengthen democratic institutions and to offer favourable conditions for investment in order to create wealth that benefits everybody. In order to attract investors and create conditions that favour sustainable development  the implementation of basic infrastructure projects is imperative  e.g.  the building of roads  ports  airports  providing electricity to the main towns of the country  improving telecommunications networks  all of which requires the support of the international community.   Lack of security is a fertile ground for all kinds of temptation. It favours destabilizing elements that exploit the subhuman conditions under which a large number of our poor live  by arming them to sow death and destruction in the Haitian family  thus imperilling the very future of our Republic. Attacking this lack of security and the climate of violence marked by dramatic kidnappings and deadly clashes between armed gangs and the police is one of the top priorities of my Government. Dialogue  on the one hand  and toughness  on the other hand  are necessary in finding a viable solution to banditry  which in recent times has been spreading in the country  causing a flight of capital as well as a brain drain. Accordingly  the technical and financial support of the international community is therefore essential in the effective implementation of the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration programme. We are aware that Haiti is not a classic case  but that does not mean that we should do nothing.   In order to provide speedy relief to the sufferings of the masses and to reduce  even eliminate  the sources of gang recruitment  my Government has launched a social pacification programme. This programme provides for the establishment of a database of more than 300 projects and actions in various sectors of our national life and throughout the territory. It will help create labour-intensive jobs and will enable the State to reduce unemployment  to guarantee some relief and thereby to reduce wrongdoing.   Moreover  in order to create a climate conducive to good governance our head of State initiated an open  honest dialogue with all political sectors upon his election to the presidency. They understood the urgency and responded positively to the invitation by agreeing to participate in the current outward-looking Government  which includes members of various political parties  which are also represented in parliament. The point is to achieve social cohesion and political reconciliation  which are essential for stability  security  economic recovery and the rebuilding of an inclusive society.  The international conference for the economic and social development of Haiti  which was held in Port-au-Prince on 25 July 2006  produced promises of financial commitment by the international community. My Government intends to carry out a long-term development plan. That attests to our strong commitment to take control of the destiny of the country  and that of our international partners to respect the priorities defined by the Government.   In order to facilitate the task of the Government to create the necessary conditions for true economic    06-53958 8  and social development  I call upon donors to live up to their promises and to support Haiti in the long term. Financial aid from the international community will facilitate the consolidation of democracy and will help us to establish the basis for sustainable development. In order to attain those results and to strengthen its credibility  the Government is determined to comply with the requirements of good governance  to ease the poverty of the disadvantaged and to continue the ceaseless fight against insecurity and corruption in order to facilitate private national and foreign investment.  In conclusion  I would note that the Government of Haiti is counting on the active cooperation of the international community to assist it in its quest for peace and socio-economic development. Throughout the general debate and listening to the statements made by our many friends from CARICOM  the Americas and all over the world  Haiti has been aware of the keen desire of our partners to work side by side with Haiti in order to meet the challenges faced by our Government. Here  I wish to express the gratitude of the Government of Haiti. Haiti is faced with a daunting challenge  but there is no lack of political will. My country will — with our Organization and with all of us working together — attain our goals. "
"75",3121,"HUN",61,2006,"I first congratulate Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as the third female President of the General Assembly. I firmly believe that the involvement of women in the decision-making processes at the national and international levels can contribute to the better management of today’s global problems. In fulfilling her challenging tasks during the sixty-first session  the President may rest assured of the support and cooperation of the representatives of the Republic of Hungary. I also wish to salute her predecessor  Ambassador Jan Eliasson  who served us with distinction  dedication  an innovative spirit and a good sense of humour. He made great efforts and achievements to advance the reform of the United Nations.  During the 2005 World Summit  our heads of State or Government agreed to proposals with the potential to adapt the world Organization to the realities of our contemporary world. While we have accomplished only modest reforms so far  we should remind ourselves that United Nations reform is more a process than a single event.  In order to foster public confidence in the United Nations  we must agree on substantial management reform  with greater accountability and transparency and better allocation of resources. The reform process should include all the main bodies of this Organization  including the General Assembly  which  in our view  must remain the most important deliberative body of the Organization.  Hungary supports the expansion of the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories to better reflect the political realities of today. However  new approaches need to be identified to facilitate the emergence of a compromise. The enlargement of the Council should be combined with enhanced efficiency and improved working methods.  Hungary condemns all forms of terrorism  which give rise to fear and distrust in our daily lives. It is our firm conviction that the United Nations should remain a key player in the international fight against the scourge of terror. It is therefore natural that Hungary welcomes the recent adoption of the new United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) and looks forward to the elaboration of a comprehensive convention on terrorism by the General Assembly.  The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission was one of our top priorities. We believe that the Commission is well equipped to deal with fragile post-conflict situations.  With the establishment of the Human Rights Council  the international community has opened a whole new chapter in its joint efforts to protect human rights. My Government has wholeheartedly supported this ambitious project from the outset. We sincerely hope that with the completion of the Council’s first year of existence  adequate machinery will be put in place to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. The universal periodic review is one of the initiatives on the Council’s agenda and holds the promise of making a real difference. The full and unhindered participation of non-governmental organizations in the activities of the Council is also of vital importance for us.  Protection of minority rights  including those of national minorities  is a pivotal element of Hungary’s human rights policies. The turbulent history of our region has all too often demonstrated the potential of inter-ethnic tensions to trigger crisis situations. Conflicts based on ethnicity  both past and present  must remind us all that multi-ethnic societies are in desperate need of a sensitive and careful approach to minority issues  sound legal arrangements  generosity in practice and firmly embedded institutional guarantees  safeguarding the rights of minorities.  The interdependence of democracy and human rights is clearly demonstrated in countries and regions with a deficit of democratic practices. As the late Sergio Vieira de Mello  former High Commissioner for Human Rights  stated so eloquently  “Imperfect as the ship of democracy may be  no other vessel has proved    06-53329 28  as seaworthy in bringing us safely to the shores of human dignity”.  Driven by the policy objective of promoting democracy  the Government of Hungary launched the International Centre for Democratic Transition last year in Budapest. The Centre intends to provide guidance regarding transition in a supportive manner by collecting experience from past democratic transitions and sharing it with those determined to follow that path. Hungary fully supported the Secretary-General’s decision to establish the United Nations Democracy Fund. Being a member of the Advisory Board and a contributor to the Fund  we are pleased to recognize that the projects approved by the Fund properly reflect local  regional and global demands.  Fifty years have passed since the citizens of Hungary rose up against a brutal dictatorship  demanding democracy  human rights and dignity. The totalitarian regime crushed the dreams of the Hungarian revolution and took cruel revenge during its return to power on top of foreign tanks.  The spirit of 1956  however  was not to be defeated. Fifty years ago  the Hungarian revolution began with a peaceful demonstration to show solidarity with the Polish nation. Today  I am proud to confirm that Hungary will show solidarity with every nation that seeks freedom and democracy for its people.  It is my moral obligation to express our profound respect for the activities of the dedicated politicians and diplomats who kept the so-called Hungarian question on the agenda of the world Organization for several years. Hungary will never forget the devotion of Povl Bang-Jensen  the Danish United Nations officer who served as Secretary of the United Nations Committee entrusted with the examination of the Hungarian events of 1956. His efforts and sacrifice made for the sake of the Hungarian revolution are etched on our collective memory forever.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems constitutes a major threat to international peace and security. The most important challenge faced by the international community in this context is non-compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My Government sincerely hopes that the next NPT review cycle will ultimately bring tangible results  and it urges all nations to make genuine contributions to that effect.  Working out lasting solutions for unresolved issues relating to the western Balkans is of paramount importance for peace and stability in the European continent. Hungary is convinced that the success of the status talks in Kosovo will depend on the ability of the parties to build mutually acceptable arrangements  which  in turn  will require a proper time frame. A functioning multicultural society in Kosovo is inseparable from the sincere implementation of standards  respect for minority rights and effective decentralization  all of which are essential preconditions for the successful outcome of the status talks.  Hungary is fully committed to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is essential to revitalize the peace process on the basis of the Road Map and other agreements accepted by the parties concerned. Israel has the right to live in peace and security  and the Palestinians have the right to an independent and viable Palestinian State peacefully coexisting with its neighbours.  Peace and stability in Lebanon are vitally important for the entire Middle East. The international community  along with the parties concerned  must make every effort to ensure the swift and full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).  The Republic of Hungary is strongly committed to building a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Our resolve has been manifested by my Government’s recent decision to take over the leadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Baghlan province. Although major efforts are being undertaken by the international community to assist in the reconstruction process in Afghanistan  the primary responsibility for the stabilization and development of the country lies with the Afghan people themselves.  Hungary remains gravely concerned about the prolonged and dramatic security situation in Iraq. We welcome the resolve of the Iraqi Government to engage all communities in order to achieve reconciliation and strengthen national cohesion. I would like to reiterate Hungary’s continued commitment to assisting the people of Iraq in their endeavour to build a free and prosperous country.  The deteriorating situation in Darfur is another matter of grave concern. The Government of the Sudan should agree to the swift deployment of a United   29 06-53329  Nations peacekeeping force with a mission to halt the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. In this regard  Hungary also hopes that at this session the General Assembly will make advances in the elaboration of the important concept of the responsibility to protect.  Six years ago  the Governments of the world made a solemn pledge to strive to eliminate global poverty by signing the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). A great deal remains to be done to achieve the objectives set out in the Millennium Development Goals  in developing countries  by the donor community and here at the United Nations. We need to make sure that development  in rich and poor countries alike  is sustainable. As a new EU member  Hungary is gradually increasing its official development assistance and recognizes the special development needs of the world’s poorest regions.  In conclusion  I would like to thank and commend the outgoing Secretary-General for his tireless efforts during the past 10 years  often under difficult and challenging circumstances  to promote the principles of the Charter. His devotion  diplomatic skills and vision have earned him profound respect all over the world. "
"76",3168,"IDN",61,2006,"I wish to congratulate you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. It signals the increasing role of women  especially women from the Muslim world  in international affairs; and this is a very welcome and positive development. May I also thank and commend His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson for his able stewardship at the sixtieth session.  Let me now join colleagues in paying tribute to the outstanding service of His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  whose 10-year term of office as Secretary-General is about to conclude. Among the valuable services he has rendered is to give the world community a way of firmly grasping the fundamental challenges of our time: the challenge of security  the challenge of underdevelopment and the challenge of human rights and the rule of law.  We have contemplated these challenges well enough to know the answers. We know that long-term security can be achieved only through a durable and just peace  not one that is imposed on the weak by the strong. We can overcome the challenge of poverty only through a global partnership for development that will equitably distribute the benefits of globalization. The challenge of human rights and the rule of law can only be met by Governments that rule by the consent of the governed  Governments that are elected by and accountable to the people. In a word  democracy.  Peace  development and democracy are inseparable. Development is paralysed and democracy is meaningless in situations of violence and bloody conflict. Nowhere is this more poignantly true than in the Middle East. Over the years  Lebanon has rebuilt its civil-war-ravaged economy  only to be bombed to the ground recently by Israel. Hundreds of innocent civilians were killed in those military strikes  many of them women and children. The carnage stopped with the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  but this came only after a very lengthy process during which time the Lebanese people underwent so much unnecessary suffering and loss. The frustration and inability to take immediate action is radicalizing many people in the Muslim world.   17 06-53329   This serves to prove the importance of reforming the Security Council  in its composition  as well as the way it works  so that it can take effective action when action is a matter of life and death for thousands of people  as was recently the case in Lebanon.  Deeply committed to being a part of the solution to this crisis  Indonesia is sending an 850-strong mechanized infantry battalion to form part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)  as mandated by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). It has become an Indonesian tradition to contribute troops to United Nations peacekeeping forces. The first contingent was deployed as part of the United Nations Emergency Force I in Suez in 1957.  As for the Arab-Israeli conflict  it is essential to recognize that the problem of Palestine lies at its core. There are no military solutions to this problem  as military might can never guarantee security. There can only be a two-State solution  with the parties to the conflict assuming their responsibilities and taking concrete measures to lay down the foundations of peace. In this regard  we encourage the formation of a Palestinian government of national unity  as that will open a window of opportunity for the resumption of dialogue and for the revival of the Quartet’s Road Map for peace.   We appeal to the Security Council to act on this issue with dispatch  for Muslims everywhere have a strong emotional reaction to what they perceive to be the oppression and humiliation of their Palestinian  Iraqi and Afghan co-religionists. Terrorists operating as far away from the Middle East as South-East Asia justify their heinous crimes as retaliation for what they consider to be aggression against Islam.  Thus today we are witness to the error of some Western circles attributing to Islam a propensity for violence  matched by the error of terrorist groups claiming that violent means are sanctified by Islam. The only way to liberate the human mind from these errors is through intensive and extensive dialogue.  That is why Indonesia has been actively promoting interfaith and intercultural dialogue in the Asia-Pacific region and within the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). It is our way of debasing the ideology of the terrorists and at the same time empowering the moderates and strengthening the voice of moderation.  Earlier this month  we collaborated with Norway in holding the first global intermedia dialogue  which was attended by leading mass-media practitioners from five continents. For while the media can be a force for good  it can also do a great deal of harm  as shown by the recent cartoon controversy. Through this dialogue  we aimed to promote mass media sensitivity to other cultures and faiths  while upholding freedom of expression. As with the interfaith dialogue  the intermedia dialogue has been institutionalized and will be carried out annually.  There is also a great need for dialogue to address the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Asia. While the threat of nuclear weapons has subsided in other regions  a new nuclear theatre may be developing from West to East Asia.  It is therefore important that we find a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue regarding Iran and North Korea. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  as the cornerstone of disarmament  must be strengthened. In fact  all weapons of mass destruction should be abolished.  Indeed  we must work for peace in a relentless day-to-day struggle. Even when the guns are silent  that is not enough for the long-term survival of humankind. There must also be development. There must be an end to poverty as a basic problem of the human condition; otherwise social grievances will be a constant threat to peace.  We in the international community have the resources and the skills to conquer poverty. For that goal to be attainable  however  the developed and the developing world must be able to faithfully carry out a contract of partnership that stipulates for each side a set of obligations.  We do not need to negotiate that contract; it already exists. For the past decade and a half  the international community  within the framework of the United Nations  has produced a substantial body of documents to which we have formally committed ourselves. These constitute a contract for the conquest of poverty and its attendant maladies. It is not just a contract between and among States; it is also a contract with our peoples and with future generations.  Hence  it is appropriate that the theme of our sixty-first session should be “Implementing a global partnership for development.” As President Susilo    06-53329 18  Bambang Yudhoyono pointed out recently  all we need to do is bind ourselves to this contract and carry it out according to its letter and spirit. This means political will  which is often lacking  and a streak of sincerity  which is very rare in our time.  The developed nations have four basic obligations under this contract. The first is to tear down the walls of protectionism and open up their markets to the products of the developing world. They must salvage the Doha Development Round.   Their second obligation is to relieve their developing counterparts of some of the burdens of the debt crisis. Developing countries are often unable to fund their development programmes because they have to make huge debt payments.  The third obligation of the developed countries is to ensure sufficient volumes of financial flows to developing countries  especially in the form of foreign direct investment. Many developing countries are simply too poor to muster the capital they need to get them out of poverty.  Another essential requirement of development is technology. Hence  the fourth obligation of the developed countries is to share their technology with the developing world  striking a balance between social responsibility and respect for intellectual property rights.  The obligations of developed countries must be matched by those of the developing countries  otherwise the partnership will not be equitable. The first obligation of developing countries is to practise good governance. We must therefore wage a relentless battle against all forms of corruption. The only form of capital that is abundant in the developing world is human capital. It is therefore the second obligation of the developing countries to protect and enhance that capital through education  human resources development and health care.  The third obligation of the developing countries is to provide a climate that is friendly to foreign capital  particularly foreign direct investment. This normally means a package of incentives. It also means a level playing field and a reputation for good governance.  It is our fourth and particular obligation to make use of our natural resources with wisdom so that we meet the needs of today without robbing our future generations of their legacy. These obligations are not easy to fulfil  but they must be carried out if the global partnership for development is to work.  In the case of Indonesia  we carried out the first obligation as a matter of survival: it was the only way we could climb our way out of the limbo to which the Asian financial crisis relegated us almost a decade ago. We had to make our transition to a more fully democratic system of governance  becoming  in the process  a full-fledged democracy.  We instituted reforms in every aspect of national life. Our economic recovery is a product of reform  and our new drive for economic growth is driven by reform. In the spirit of reform and dialogue  we were able to forge a peace agreement with the separatist Free Aceh Movement. The peace has been holding for more than a year and promises to be durable.  As for our human resources  our Constitution mandates that 20 per cent of our budget be allocated to education. As part of our effort to achieve universal education  we are providing free schooling to some 60 million primary through high school students. To alleviate poverty  we are continuing to extend direct cash subsidies to some 19.1 million households.  Last year  one fourth of our total population of 220 million benefited from the medical services of community health centres. We recently reduced the price of generic medicines by 30 to 50 per cent.  With regard to foreign investment  Indonesia is sending out some very positive signals. We are legislating a new package of investment incentives  including a law on tax reform  a law that rationalizes the labour market and regulations to streamline customs procedures. We are establishing special economic zones. The response of foreign direct investors was to pour some $6 billion into Indonesia last year.  To ensure the sustainability of our environment  we have launched a national programme entitled “Towards a green Indonesia” aimed at building the capacity of local government to conserve natural resources and control environmental degradation. In sum  Indonesia is ready for partnership — ready to be an active participant in that global partnership for development that will enable the developing world to reach its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). I believe that many other developing countries are just   19 06-53329  as ready for that partnership; and  if they feel they are not ready at the moment  it takes nothing more — but nothing less as well — than political will to get themselves to a proper state of preparedness. That also applies to the countries of the developed North — they must also have the political will to fulfil their end of the partnership. Otherwise  that partnership will not be worth the paper on which so many Summit documents were printed. Given that development  peace and human dignity are inseparable  the destiny of this partnership parallels the destiny of the entire human race; a partnership for development is also a partnership for peace and for the dignity of the human being. "
"77",3215,"IND",61,2006,"At the outset  Madam  let me join previous speakers in welcoming your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. On India’s behalf  I would like to assure you of our constructive support and wholehearted commitment to work with you to achieve both the larger goals of the Charter and the more specific goals of the reform of this Organization that were set out in last year’s World Summit Outcome Document.  The topic of this general debate is “Implementing a global partnership for development”. It is difficult to contest its relevance or topicality. Today  whether we look at issues such as international trade  international financial mechanisms  methods to improve economic and social well-being  or even the various threats to peace and security that challenge our collective existence  one common theme that emerges is the lack of an effective and equitable global partnership. This is an imperative even for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  The important annual report of the Secretary-General highlights several successes in moving ahead with United Nations reform. During the previous General Assembly session  the Central Emergency Response Fund  the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council were established  and the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy was agreed upon. We have also gradually moved forward on management and budgetary reforms. While these are certainly important — indeed  critical — if we are honest  we must acknowledge that significant unfulfilled tasks and challenges lie ahead  particularly with regard to unaddressed issues  including the reform of the architecture of our multilateral bodies that oversee security  trade  financial flows and development. Without this reform  the discontent associated with globalization will only deepen. Without it  there cannot be substantially enhanced and assured resource and technology flows to developing countries  which are necessary for real economic transformation and for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  It is sometimes argued that private sector investment is today replacing the traditional reliance on aid and development assistance. While we appreciate the important role of private sector investment  it cannot replace public investment in developing countries  whose absorptive capacities are often limited and where the physical and social infrastructure is often weak. Official development assistance (ODA) remains an important means to   7 06-53952  augment public investment in areas such as human capital development and rural infrastructure  which rarely attract private sector investment.  The process of increasing the available pool of resources for investment in the social and economic infrastructure of developing countries can be promoted at one level by developed countries  expeditiously reaching the target of setting aside 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product for official development assistance.  At another level  there is also a need to develop innovative sources of financing. We must evolve a broader understanding of ways to encourage the least developed countries to get out of the debt trap by extending debt-cancellation programmes  without insisting on conditionalities  such as encouraging privatization  which  applied indiscriminately  may recreate the original difficulties that necessitated recourse to debt in the first place.  The impasse in international trade negotiations is disappointing  to say the least  considering the hopes raised after the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference and at the Group of Eight Summit in Saint Petersburg in July. Early resumption is desirable  but adherence to the existing mandate is imperative — the mandate of the Doha Declaration  the July framework and the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration. When agriculture was brought into the ambit of negotiations at the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO)  the developing countries were given a clear understanding that trade-distorting agricultural subsidies would be phased out in a time-bound manner. Minimizing the vulnerabilities of poor farmers must be our collective priority. Demanding market access from developing countries  which displace low-income and subsistence farmers to satisfy commercial interests  cannot be supported.   Proportionately lower overall tariff reduction commitments  operable  effective development instruments for special products and a special safeguard mechanism are essential if we are to ensure food and livelihood security and meet the rural development needs of developing countries. The overarching principle of special and differential treatment therefore remains a categorical imperative  and is the underlying basis of the position of developing countries.  In our view  there exists an overwhelming logic for giving the United Nations a role in providing direction to the comprehensive reform of the international financial and trading systems. These reforms must be aimed at building an international architecture that reflects the realities of the twenty-first century and is able to create an environment that effectively supports national efforts to eradicate poverty. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have given hope to the poor and the underprivileged of the world  and these goals are to be achieved by 2015. In this context  the World Bank must remain steadfast in its mission to build a world free of poverty  and its strategy must remain embedded in the historical development-centric approach.   The Outcome Document of last year’s World Summit emphasized that enhancing the voice and participation of developing countries in the Bretton Woods institutions remains a continuous concern. The bridging of this voice deficit requires fundamental reforms in the quota structure which are long overdue and absolutely necessary to enhance the credibility and legitimacy of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The quota reforms have to begin with the revision of the formula so as to reflect the relative economic strengths of countries in the twenty-first century. The United Nations should encourage immediate steps being taken to initiate the second stage of IMF quota reform  involving a basic revision of the quota formula and the subsequent increase of quotas for all under-represented countries. All of this must be done in a time-bound manner.  Change is the law of life. The acute dissatisfaction heard in many statements is the result of institutions having been prevented from changing. What is true in the economic field is equally true of the architecture of our international security system as reflected in this unique Organization that is supposed to reflect the collective will of our world  a system which remains mired in the past. Recent tragic events in Lebanon and the stasis in the peace process in the broader Middle East have highlighted the growing failure of the institution designated by the Charter as having primary responsibility for issues relating to peace and security.  It is widely accepted that the Security Council can no longer be regarded as reflecting the changed international environment that has emerged since the time of its creation. The Security Council must not    06-53952 8  only be more representative but also more effective if it is to be able to satisfactorily perform the role mandated to it by the Charter.  At the same time  the Security Council has needlessly diverted its attention to issues and areas that go beyond its mandate. For instance  the inclusion of items on its agenda which have nothing to do with peace and security represents an encroachment on the roles mandated to other United Nations bodies. In order to ensure that the international community exercises real ownership of the process of securing our world  it is essential that comprehensive reform of the Security Council be undertaken and that its membership be expanded in both the permanent and the non-permanent categories. It is no accident that the Secretary-General’s report refers to the enhancement of legitimacy and the urgent need for reform to ensure the Security Council’s relevance and credibility.  The revitalization of the General Assembly is intertwined with the reform of the Security Council. It is no coincidence that its reform too has long been frustrated. A strengthened and more effective United Nations presumes a revitalized General Assembly that exercises its role and authority in the areas of responsibility assigned to it by the Charter. These include its effectively addressing topics such as international law and human rights  financial  budgetary and administrative matters  as well as the global economic architecture and important issues related to development.  I now turn to one of the most crucial issues of our times: the problem of terrorism. While this phenomenon has become increasingly global  our collective response to it has remained rather inadequate. The multiple ways in which terrorism challenges the core principles of humanity and the mandate of the United Nations are underlined by the outrages perpetrated in India over the last few months. Barely two months ago  on a single black day  more than 200 lives were lost and more than 1 000 were injured by dastardly bombings in Mumbai and elsewhere in India. These and other such outrageous incidents were clearly designed to spread maximum terror among ordinary people. Ours is not the only country to be singled out for vicious and senseless acts of murder. A strong response to terrorism requires broad-based international cooperation  denying to terrorists the space that has been available to them and increasing the capability of States to address terrorist threats. It requires sustained and specific cooperation by a variety of national  regional and global agencies.  Earlier this month  we joined in the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  even though  ideally  we would have liked the United Nations to convey a far stronger message in order to counter terrorism. We must collectively and unanimously reject the notion that any cause can justify terrorism. No cause can ever justify the targeted killing of innocent men  women and children. The international community must signal that it will no longer tolerate the actions of the sponsors and abettors of terrorism  including States which wilfully fail to prevent terrorists from utilizing their territory. We hope that the Strategy will provide the impetus to unite the international community in its fight against terrorism via practical measures that facilitate cooperation by way of extradition  prosecution  information exchange and capacity-building.  We went along with the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  but the comprehensive convention on international terrorism  which remains a work in progress  would have provided the requisite legal framework upon which a counter-terrorism strategy could have been based. It cannot be beyond our collective ingenuity to reach an agreement on such a comprehensive convention  even though we have missed the target of doing so at the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. We must work together to finalize and adopt the comprehensive convention  at least during this session of the General Assembly.  The existence of nuclear weapons continues to threaten international peace and security. In our view  the best non-proliferation measure is universal disarmament  and the international community needs to take immediate steps to eliminate the threat of the use of nuclear weapons. We have to revive momentum for achieving what the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called a nuclear-weapon-free and non-violent world  to be achieved  through negotiations  in a time-bound manner. India will be presenting a working paper at this session of the General Assembly on the issue of nuclear disarmament  on which we look forward to working with Member States.  In recent years  new dangers have emerged due to the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction-related materials and technologies to non-  9 06-53952  State actors and terrorist groups. The international community must work together to meet those challenges. India’s record in that regard is impeccable  and we have instituted effective measures to ensure that the technologies we develop are not leaked in any way.  It is true that the developing countries bear the heaviest burden from pandemics  epidemics and chronic diseases. The scourge of HIV/AIDS  malaria  avian influenza and tuberculosis seriously threatens the future of many developing countries by robbing them of the most productive segment of their society — their young people — thereby affecting the future of those countries. An enhanced global collaborative effort is called for to confront the proliferation of challenges affecting the lives of the majority of our citizens.  We also need to address the central issue of the special needs of the developing countries  especially in Africa  and of the vulnerable small States. On our part  we will continue to expand our programme of South-South cooperation also through the New Partnership for Africa’s Development  through Team 9 — our special programme for West African countries — and by means of the connectivity mission in Africa  as well as through assistance  capacity-building and technology transfer aimed at reducing the vulnerability of small States.  Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru  who embodied our commitment to the United Nations ideals  said that  “in a world of incessant and feverish activity  men have little time to think  much less to consider ideals and objectives. Yet  how are we to act  even in the present  unless we know which way we are going and what our objectives are?”   Confronted as we are by the globalization of threats and by the limitations of our international system to address such challenges  the need for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations has never been more imperative. We need to enfranchise the United Nations to meet the challenges of our time by reinforcing its role and authority as the core of real multilateralism.  We look forward to working closely with other Member States  under your leadership  Madam President  to press ahead with essential reforms at the United Nations and to implement an effective global partnership for development that encompasses everyone and enables every individual to live a life of dignity in a clean  safe and healthy environment. "
"78",3261,"IRL",61,2006,"Let me begin by congratulating you  Madam President  on your appointment and assuring you of Ireland’s full support for the coming year.   This session of the General Assembly is the last under the stewardship of Secretary-General Annan. I salute his achievements and pay tribute to his leadership. He has carried out his heavy responsibilities with wisdom and dignity. He can step down from office fully satisfied with the service he has given to the peoples of the United Nations. I was proud last year to act as one of his envoys in the vital reform agenda that he pioneered.  Since the 2005 World Summit significant progress has been made. The Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council have been established. But there is more to be done. Management reform is essential to revitalizing the Organization and ensuring that the Secretariat can focus on the priorities we all share. It is in the interest of us all — developed and developing countries alike — for it to succeed.   The continuing stalemate over the reform of the Security Council leaves it insufficiently representative of the world as it now is. That serves those who for their own reasons would challenge its legitimacy. This situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely  so I welcome recent efforts to restart negotiations on possible options likely to win widespread support.  The true test of the United Nations is  however  not the efficiency of its structures  but the effectiveness of its actions. As the Secretary-General said last week  three key challenges face the world: first  achieving sustainable development and the elimination of poverty and disease; secondly  the promotion of universal human rights and the rule of law; and  thirdly  ensuring security  the prevention of conflict and the ending of war.   In setting our own national aid target of meeting the goal of 0.7 per cent of gross national income by 2012  three years ahead of the European Union schedule  Ireland has put the Millennium Development Goals at the heart of its aid programme  with a special focus on Africa  poverty reduction  tackling hunger  and HIV/AIDS. Last week we published a White Paper which sets out clearly and in detail how we aim to achieve our development objectives. Sustainable development must include addressing the immense global threat of climate change. Development is also the key to addressing the enormous challenges posed by migration.  Ireland is deeply committed to Africa. Despite its huge problems  there are encouraging signs. We are inspired by the efforts to shape new institutions and more cohesive societies in the aftermath of conflicts and cruelties in Sierra Leone  Burundi  Rwanda  Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Ireland is honoured to assist these and other countries through their difficult transitions  including through aid and the presence of our troops in the United Nations   7 06-53609  Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). We particularly support the efforts of the African Union to bring peace and prosperity to Africa  helping to place Africans firmly in control of their own destiny.  However  not all of our collective efforts have met with success. The suffering of the people of Darfur shames the world. There has been human tragedy there on a massive scale  with the intimidation  rape and murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents and the displacement of vast numbers from their homes. Just two months ago I visited a displacement camp myself  in Aboushouk in Darfur. I have seen how precarious the lives of the people are there and also their determination to return home to a better future for themselves and their children.   The people of Darfur have three essential needs. First  humanitarian aid must be delivered safely and without restrictions. Secondly  there must be an international peacekeeping force with a robust mandate. As set out by the Security Council  it should be a well-equipped and substantial United Nations force. I again appeal strongly to the Sudanese Government to agree to the deployment of such a force  and to all those with influence on it to persuade it so to do. I cannot emphasize enough the urgency of this. Pending the arrival of a United Nations force  the African Union force — whose continuation I welcome — should have the resources necessary to play a more effective role. Thirdly  long-term security can only be guaranteed by the full implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement.  Last year the World Summit defined the international community’s responsibility to protect populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity should national authorities fail to do so. It would be a disgrace if this major advance became an exercise in empty rhetoric. The Government of Sudan has fundamental responsibility for the safety of its own people. The international community must find ways to persuade it to live up to that responsibility  if need be including further measures against it. We cannot indefinitely stand by and watch with horror from the sidelines.  There can be no lasting development or security without full respect for human rights. The human rights of the most vulnerable are especially important. I strongly welcome the recent conclusion of negotiations on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Human Rights Council must  in developing its new ways of working  build on the achievements of its predecessor. It must demonstrate that it can provide strong leadership  particularly in dealing effectively with grave human rights abuses. The human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar remains particularly grave. I again call on the regime to move towards democracy and to release all political prisoners  in particular Aung San Suu Kyi.  The centrality of the United Nations to international peace and security is once again underlined by the issues dominating the debate in the Assembly. The question is not whether the United Nations is relevant  but  rather  whether it can respond effectively to all the situations which clamour for its attention. The Peacebuilding Commission adds an important new dimension. It must be properly resourced  and Ireland is pleased to be contributing €10 million to that fund.  The single greatest challenge to international peace and security is the situation in the Middle East. The dreadful events of recent months have again brought before the eyes of the world the continuing suffering being borne by the peoples of the region. Frustration at the long agony of the Palestinian people creates and sharpens wider divisions across the world. A comprehensive settlement of the interrelated problems of the region is more urgently required than at any time in the past 60 years.   In Lebanon there are signs of hope  but there is no room for complacency. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) offers a path to a stable peace  and good progress is being made in its implementation. European countries in particular have responded well to the call for contributions to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) II. Ireland will very shortly be in a position to offer its own contribution to that force.   But the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians will continue to generate surges of conflict across the region until it is resolved. Any illusion that there can be a unilateral or a military solution has surely been shattered. This is a conflict about the sharing of space. The only solution lies in a negotiated outcome. It is time for a major international effort to launch serious negotiations for a settlement — the establishment of two sovereign democratic States living together in peace and security.    06-53609 8   But to achieve peace there must be partners for peace. Ireland strongly supports the continuing efforts of President Abbas to create a national unity government committed to the peace process and reflecting the Quartet principles. If he succeeds the international community must be generous and creative in response. Israel’s absolute right to exist in peace and security should be unchallenged. But  not least in its own interests  Israel must engage seriously and openly with the Palestinians. It must cease all activities  in particular the expansion of settlements  which are against international law and which make a lasting peace harder to attain.  Ireland shares the Secretary-General’s continuing outrage at the failure of last year’s Summit to make any reference to nuclear disarmament. It is simply folly to let this issue languish. In the next review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons we must do better. Ireland will work with like-minded partners to keep this issue on the agenda. Dr. Hans Blix has already offered us a range of fresh and practical ideas from which we can draw. The world is right to insist on nuclear non-proliferation  but progress on disarmament would make that insistence still more compelling. Ireland  with its European partners  wants to see a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iran’s nuclear programme  and we call on Iran to respond positively and rapidly to the wide-ranging proposals that have been put to it. We equally support efforts to renew the six-party talks on North Korea.  The world must also act to reduce the supply of small arms and light weapons  which facilitate the escalation of local tensions into all-out conflicts. Ireland strongly supports the negotiation of an arms trade treaty. The disturbing reports from Lebanon also highlight the need for further restrictions on the use of cluster bombs.  On behalf of my Government  I pay particular tribute to Prime Minister Blair for his commitment and dedication to the peace process in Northern Ireland. He and my Prime Minister  Taoiseach Bertie Ahern  have devoted almost 10 years to driving it forward. Credit is also due to the parties in Northern Ireland  who  despite deep and abiding divisions reaching far back into our history  are committed to addressing those divisions purely within the political arena.   In Northern Ireland the word has finally replaced the weapon as the way to resolve disputes. The Northern Ireland peace process is now at an important juncture. We have worked hard to implement the 1998 Good Friday Agreement  but its capstone  a sustained power-sharing government  has for far too long proved elusive. The British and Irish Governments are demanding that the political parties there agree by 24 November this year to form such a government. That deadline is real  reflecting our shared belief that drift and uncertainty on the political front are not in the interests of peace and reconciliation  and cannot be sustained.  If the parties fail to agree  both Governments will deepen their cooperation to deliver improvements in peoples’ daily lives. But that is not our preferred option. We want local politicians in Northern Ireland taking responsibility for the issues that concern their people. The conditions for a power-sharing government have never been more favourable. It is what the people want. Inevitably it will happen some time. But if it does not happen in November the opportunity may not come again for a considerable time.  The great Irish writer George Bernard Shaw once said that making war was hard  but that making peace was infinitely more arduous. Peacebuilding and conflict resolution are ultimately about psychology — addressing fears  perceptions and beliefs about the past and about the future. A conflict does not begin when the trigger is pulled; it begins in the heart and mind of the person who pulls that trigger. We have learned this at first hand in Ireland. We know the pain and difficulty of dealing with the legacy of division. But over the years we have learned some things about building peace  encouraging reconciliation  improving human rights and the rule of law and addressing social and economic alienation.   Our own national experience reinforces what we have learned at the United Nations and from our development programme. That is why we have just established in Ireland an Irish Conflict Analysis and Resolution Support Unit. It will seek to harness our experience and help to share it. It will work closely with the Peacebuilding Commission. We do not overestimate what we can do  nor do we underestimate the difficulty of peacebuilding  but I genuinely believe that our track record means that we can bring something distinctive to the table. I would encourage all countries represented here to find ways of sharing their own experience and exchanging and enhancing   9 06-53609  our collective knowledge of how to prevent and resolve conflict.  Since the establishment of the United Nations the world has been spared a repeat of the catastrophic global conflicts that made the first half of the twentieth century the bloodiest era in human history. But the challenges ahead of us remain grave and pressing. When we met here last year we agreed an ambitious agenda for the twenty-first century. We have made progress since then  but there is still so much to do. We must now focus on making our ambitions real. "
"79",3308,"IRN",61,2006,"I praise the merciful  all-knowing and almighty God for blessing me with another opportunity to address this Assembly on behalf of the great nation of Iran and to bring a number of issues to the attention of the international community. I also praise the Almighty for the increasing vigilance of peoples across the globe  their courageous presence in different international settings  and the brave expression of their views and aspirations regarding global issues.  Today  humanity passionately craves commitment to the truth  devotion to God  the quest for justice and respect for the dignity of human beings. Rejection of domination and aggression  defence of the oppressed  and longing for peace constitute the legitimate demand of the peoples of the world  particularly the new generations and the spirited youth who aspire to a world free from decadence  aggression and injustice  replete with love and compassion. The youth have a right to seek justice and the truth. They have a right to build their own future on the foundations of love  compassion and tranquillity. I praise the Almighty for this immense blessing.  What afflicts humanity today is certainly not compatible with human dignity. The Almighty has not created human beings so that they could transgress against others and oppress them. By causing war and conflict  some are quickly expanding their domination  accumulating greater wealth and usurping all the resources  while others endure poverty  suffering and misery as a result.  Some seek to rule the world relying on weapons and threats  while others live in perpetual insecurity and danger. Some occupy the homeland of others  thousands of kilometres away from their borders  interfere in their affairs and control their oil and other resources and strategic routes  while others are bombarded daily in their own homes  their children murdered in the streets and alleys of their own country  and their homes reduced to rubble.  Such behaviour is not worthy of human beings and runs counter to the truth  to justice and to human dignity. The fundamental question is this: under such conditions  where should the oppressed seek justice? Who  or what organization  defends the rights of the oppressed and suppresses acts of aggression and oppression? Where is the seat of global justice?  A brief glance at a few examples of the most pressing global issues further illustrates the problem. The first is the unbridled expansion of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons. Some Powers have proudly announced the production of second- and third-generation nuclear weapons. What do they need those weapons for? Is the development and stockpiling of such deadly weapons designed to promote peace and democracy? Or  are the weapons actually instruments of coercion and threat directed against other peoples and Governments?  How long should the people of the world have to live with the nightmare of nuclear  biological and chemical weapons? What binds the Powers that produce and possess those weapons? How can they be held accountable by the international community? Furthermore  are the inhabitants of those countries content with wasting their wealth and resources on the production of such destructive arsenals? Is it not possible to rely on justice  ethics and wisdom instead of on such instruments of death? Are not wisdom and justice more compatible with peace and tranquillity   37 06-52737  than nuclear  chemical and biological weapons? If wisdom  ethics and justice prevail  then oppression and aggression will be uprooted  threats will wither away and no reason will remain for conflict.  This is a solid proposition  because most global conflicts result from injustice and from the fact that the powerful are not content with their own rights  but want to deny the rights of others.  People across the globe embrace justice and are willing to make sacrifices for its sake. Would it not be easier for the global Powers to ensure their longevity and win hearts and minds through the championing and real promotion of justice  compassion and peace  rather than by continuing the proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons and threatening their use?  We have experienced the threat and the use of nuclear weapons. Has it achieved anything for the perpetrators other than the exacerbation of tension  hatred and animosity among nations?  The second issue is the occupation of countries and the exacerbation of hostilities. The occupation of Iraq has continued for the past three years. Not a day goes by without hundreds of people being killed in cold blood. The occupiers are incapable of establishing security in Iraq. Despite the establishment of a lawful Government and the National Assembly of Iraq  covert and overt efforts are being made to heighten insecurity  magnify and aggravate differences within Iraqi society and instigate civil strife.  There is no sign that the occupiers have the necessary political will to eliminate the sources of instability. Numerous terrorists were apprehended by the Government of Iraq  only to be let loose under various pretexts by the occupiers. It seems that the intensification of hostilities and terrorism serves as a pretext for the continued presence of foreign forces in Iraq.  Where can the people of Iraq seek refuge  and from whom should the Government of Iraq seek justice? Who can ensure Iraq’s security? Insecurity in Iraq affects the entire region. Can the Security Council play a role in restoring peace and security in Iraq when the occupiers are themselves permanent members of the Council? Is the Security Council capable of making a fair decision in this regard?  Let us consider the situation in Palestine. The roots of the Palestinian problem go back to the Second World War. Under the pretext of protecting some of the survivors of that war  the land of Palestine was occupied through war and aggression  resulting in the displacement of millions of its inhabitants. It was placed under the control of some of the survivors of the war  who brought even larger population groups from elsewhere in the world who had not even been affected by the Second World War. A Government was established in the territory of others with a population collected from throughout the world at the cost of driving millions of the rightful inhabitants of the land into diaspora and homelessness.  That is a great tragedy with hardly any precedent in history. Refugees continue to live in temporary refugee camps  and many have died while still hoping one day to return to their land. Can any logic  law or legal reasoning justify this tragedy? Would any Member of the United Nations accept such a tragedy if it occurred in its own homeland?  The pretexts for the creation of the regime occupying Al-Quds al-Sharif are so weak that its supporters want to silence any voice that tries merely to speak about them  as they are concerned that shedding light on the facts would undermine the raison d’être of the regime — as  indeed  it has done. The tragedy did not end with the establishment of a regime on the territory of others. Regrettably  from its inception  that regime has been a constant source of threat and insecurity in the Middle East region — waging war  spilling blood and impeding the progress of countries in the region. It has also been used by some Powers as an instrument of division  coercion and pressure on the people of the region.  Reference to those historical realities may cause some disquiet among supporters of that regime. But these are simple facts  not myths. History has unfolded before our eyes. Worse still is the unwarranted blanket support provided to the regime. We need only watch what is happening in the Palestinian land. People are being bombarded in their own homes and their children murdered in their own streets and alleys. But no authority  not even the Security Council  can afford them any support or protection. Why?  Meanwhile  a Government has been formed democratically and through the free choice of the electorate in a part of the Palestinian territory. But instead of receiving the support of the so-called champions of democracy  its ministers and members of    06-52737 38  parliament have been illegally abducted and incarcerated in full view of the international community.  What council or international organization is standing up to protect this brutally besieged Government? Why cannot the Security Council take any steps?  I should like now to address the issue of Lebanon. For 33 long days  the Lebanese lived under a barrage of fire and bombs  and close to 1.5 million of them were displaced. Meanwhile  some members of the Security Council practically chose a path that provided ample opportunity for the aggressor to achieve its objectives militarily. We saw the Security Council practically incapacitated by certain Powers so that it could not even call for a ceasefire. The Security Council sat idly by for many days  witnessing cruel scenes of atrocities against the Lebanese  while tragedies such as the one that occurred at Qana were persistently repeated. Why?  In all of these cases  the answer is self-evident. When the Power behind the hostilities is itself a permanent member of the Security Council  how can the Council fulfil its responsibilities?  The third issue is lack of respect for the rights of members of the international community.  I now wish to speak about some of the grievances of the Iranian people and about the injustices against them.  The Islamic Republic of Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is committed to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). All our nuclear activities are transparent and peaceful and are under the watchful eyes of IAEA inspectors. Why then are there objections to our legally recognized rights? Which Governments object to those rights? Governments that themselves benefit from nuclear energy and the fuel cycle. Some of them have abused nuclear technology for non-peaceful ends  including the production of nuclear bombs  and some even have a bleak record of using them against humanity.  Which organization or council should address those injustices? Is the Security Council in a position to address them? Can it stop violations of the inalienable rights of countries? Can it prevent certain Powers from impeding the scientific progress of other countries? The abuse of the Security Council  as an instrument of threat and coercion  is indeed a source of grave concern. Some permanent members of the Security Council  even when they are themselves parties to international disputes  conveniently threaten others with the Security Council and  even before any decision by the Council  proclaim the Council’s condemnation of their opponents.  The question is: what can justify such exploitation of the Security Council  and do not such acts erode its credibility and effectiveness? Can such behaviour strengthen the ability of the Council to maintain security?  A review of recent historical realities would lead to the regrettable conclusion that justice has become a victim of force and aggression. Many global arrangements have become unjust  discriminatory and irresponsible as a result of undue pressure from some of the powerful nations. Threats to use nuclear weapons and other instruments of war  by some powers have taken the place of respect for the rights of nations and the maintenance and promotion of peace and tranquillity.  For some Powers  claims of promoting human rights and democracy can last only as long as the claims can be used as instruments of pressure and intimidation against other nations. But when it comes to the interests of the claimants  concepts such as democracy  the right of self-determination of nations  respect for the rights and intelligence of peoples  and international law and justice have no place or value. That is blatantly manifested in the way in which the elected Government of the Palestinian people is treated  as well as in the support extended to the Zionist regime. It does not matter if people are murdered in Palestine  turned into refugees  captured  imprisoned or besieged; that  apparently  does not violate human rights.  Nations are not equal in exercising their rights as recognized by international law. Enjoying those rights is dependent on the whim of certain major Powers. Apparently  the Security Council can only be used to ensure the security and the rights of some big Powers. But when the oppressed are being bombarded and decimated  the Security Council must remain aloof and not even call for a ceasefire. Is this not a tragedy of historic proportions for the Security Council  which is charged with maintaining the security of countries?   39 06-52737   The prevailing order of contemporary global interactions is such that certain Powers equate themselves with the international community and consider that their decisions supersede those of over 180 other countries. They consider themselves to be the masters and rulers of the entire world and give other nations a mere second-class ranking in the world order.  The question needs to be asked: if the Governments of the United States or the United Kingdom  countries which are permanent members of the Security Council  commit aggression  occupation and violation of international law  which of the United Nations organs can call them to account? Can a Council in which they are privileged members address their violations? Has that ever happened? In fact  we have repeatedly seen the reverse. If they have a difference with a nation or State  they bring the matter to the Security Council as claimants  then simultaneously arrogate to themselves the roles of prosecutor  judge and executioner. Is that a just order? Can there be a more vivid case of discrimination and more clear evidence of injustice?  Regrettably  the persistence of some hegemonic Powers in imposing their exclusionist policies on the international decision-making mechanisms  including the Security Council  has resulted in a growing mistrust on the part of world public opinion that is undermining the credibility and effectiveness of the most universal system of collective security. How long can such a situation last in the world? It is evident that the behaviour of some Powers constitutes the greatest challenge before the Security Council  the entire Organization and its affiliated agencies.  The present structure and working methods of the Security Council  which are legacies of the Second World War  are not responsive to the expectations of the current generation and the contemporary needs of humanity. Today  it is undeniable that the Security Council  most critically and urgently  requires legitimacy and effectiveness. It must be acknowledged that as long as the Council is unable to act on behalf of the entire international community in a transparent  just and democratic manner  it will be neither legitimate nor effective. Furthermore  the direct relationship between abuse of the veto power and erosion of the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council has now been clearly and undeniably established. We cannot and should not expect the eradication  or even the containment  of injustice  imposition and oppression without reforming the structure and working methods of the Council.  Is it appropriate to expect this generation to submit to decisions and arrangements established over half a century ago? Does not this generation or future generations have the right to make their own decisions about the world in which they want to live?  Today  genuine reform in the structure and working methods of the Security Council is more necessary than ever. Justice and democracy dictate that the role of the General Assembly  as the highest organ of the United Nations  must be respected. The General Assembly can then  through appropriate mechanisms  take on the task of reforming the Organization and  in particular  rescue the Security Council from its current state. In the interim  the Non-Aligned Movement  the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the African continent should each have permanent-member status in the Security Council  with veto privilege. The resulting balance would hopefully prevent further trampling of the rights of nations.  It is essential that spirituality and ethics find their rightful place in international relations. Without ethics and spirituality  attained in the light of the teachings of the divine prophets  justice  freedom and human rights cannot be guaranteed. The resolution of contemporary human crises lies in observing ethics and spirituality and in the governance of righteous people of high competence and piety. Should respect for the rights of human beings become the predominant objective  then injustice  ill temper  aggression and war will fade away.  Human beings are all God’s creatures and are all endowed with dignity and respect. No one has superiority over others. No individual or State can arrogate to themselves special privileges; nor can they disregard the rights of others or position themselves  through influence and pressure  as the “international community”.  Citizens of Asia  Africa  Europe and America are all equal. Over six billion inhabitants of the Earth are all equal and worthy of respect. Justice and the protection of human dignity are the two pillars in maintaining sustainable peace  security and tranquillity in the world.    06-52737 40   It is for this reason that we state that sustainable peace and tranquillity in the world can only be attained through justice  spirituality  ethics  compassion and respect for human dignity. All nations and States are entitled to peace  progress and security. We are all members of the international community  and we are all entitled to insist on the creation of a climate of compassion  love and justice.  All Members of the United Nations are affected by both the bitter and sweet events and developments in today’s world. We can adopt firm and logical decisions  thereby improving the prospects for a better life for current and future generations. Together  we can eradicate the roots of bitter maladies and afflictions  and instead  through the promotion of universal and lasting values  such as ethics  spirituality and justice  allow our nations to taste the sweetness of a better future.  Peoples  driven by their divine nature  intrinsically seek good  virtue  perfection and beauty. Relying on our peoples  we can take giant steps towards reform and pave the road to human perfection. Whether we like it or not  justice  peace and virtue will sooner or later prevail in the world with the will of Almighty God. It is imperative  and also desirable  that we  too  contribute to the promotion of justice and virtue.  The Almighty and Merciful God  who is the Creator of the Universe  is also its Lord and Ruler. Justice is His command. He commands His creatures to support one another in good  virtue and piety  and not in decadence or corruption. He commands His creatures to enjoin one another to righteousness and virtue and not to sin or transgression. All divine prophets  from the Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) to the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him)  to the Prophet Jesus Christ (peace be upon him)  to the Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him)  have all called humanity to monotheism  justice  brotherhood  love and compassion. Is it not possible to build a better world based on monotheism  justice  love and respect for the rights of human beings  and thereby transform animosities into friendship?  I emphatically declare that today’s world  more than ever before  longs for just and righteous people with love for all humanity; and above all  it longs for the perfect righteous human being and the real saviour who has been promised to all peoples and who will establish justice  peace and brotherhood on the planet.  O  Almighty God  all men and women are Your creatures  and You have ordained their guidance and salvation. Bestow upon humanity that thirsts for justice the perfect human being promised to all by You  and make us among his followers and among those who strive for his return and his cause. "
"80",3355,"IRQ",61,2006,"With confidence  Iraq is making qualitative steps in the transition to nationhood. Under extremely difficult circumstances  Iraq is pursuing this goal and the inherently complicated task of rebuilding the country. Iraq continues courageously to reach for the promise of a democratic  federal and pluralistic State  where generations of long-oppressed Iraqis will regain their dignity and freedom and their right to join the civilized and progressive nations of the world.  As we make our way forward  we are keen to establish a deep-rooted experiment with seeds from Iraq’s authentically rich and enlightened ancient heritage. We will pay attention to the lessons of older civilizations in Iraq and the national diversity that embodies the Iraqi vision.  The new Iraq has passed through crucial transitional stages in an incredibly short period of time.    06-53317 8  The political process has been strengthened and expanded through the participation of broader and more effective social  political and civil forces. Last year  the first parliamentary elections were held  leading to the formation of a Transitional National Assembly; these were followed by a national referendum on a permanent constitution for the first time in the history of modern Iraq. A second round of elections was held on 15 December 2005  which elected members of a Council of Representatives for a four-year term. The Council convened on 1 February 2006.   These developments  supported by the will of the Iraqi political forces and with the help of our friends  have galvanized the Iraqi majority with its varied political  social and intellectual background. They have created a positive political process  which has produced a Government of National Unity and Salvation under the leadership of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.  The region of Iraqi Kurdistan elected a Council of Representatives  followed by the formation of a united Kurdistan Regional Government. This demonstrates that political harmony does indeed exist in the midst of the country’s broader political process. It demonstrates significant development in our economy  our culture and our social fabric as a whole where security  stability and economic prosperity prevail. A market economy has been successful and prosperous for Iraq.   What we have achieved so far in the political arena reflects a united national will to succeed in the process of building an Iraq that can confront all of its challenges  ranging from defeating the terrorists — who label others as infidels — and extremist ideologies  to achieving security and stability.   Terrorist operations and activities of those who label others as infidels and organized crime groups in our country are not merely characterized by the killing of innocent people or provoking security chaos; they also aim at destroying the country’s infrastructure and hampering our ongoing efforts to rebuild the country and place it firmly on the path of peace  security and democracy.  We must emphasize that the forces of extremism  those that oppose democracy and human values  are intent on making Iraq a stepping stone for reaching other goals and for wreaking even more destruction. These forces comprise regional and Arab elements that export their crises beyond their borders in the hope that Iraq will prove to be fertile ground on which they can deal with those crises by fighting their battles on Iraqi soil and among the people of Iraq. Those groups are mainly composed of remnants of the former dictatorial regime in league with organized criminal elements  themselves a product of the oppression of the old regime and the lapses of security that followed its collapse.   The supply line of money and weapons for those groups extends to neighbouring Arab and regional States. They are further supported by individuals who infiltrate the borders  many of them Al-Qaida operatives and runaway Saddamists. Such groups harbour the illusion that they can suppress the will of our people by continuing to kill  terrorize and spread despair among innocent Iraqis.   To confront such evil intent  national determination will flourish  welcoming all the people of Iraq to participate in the process of building a national consensus. The Prime Minister has launched a national reconciliation plan in the hope of providing the protection and conditions that are necessary for political stability  calm and security. This initiative was formulated and developed through the contributions of a number of political parties holding seats in parliament and represented on Iraq’s National Security Council. That is how the first steps towards success were taken. The initiative has received the support of several political opposition groups  including militant groups that were previously part of the armed opposition.  We continue to make efforts within the tripartite Presidential Council — the President  the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Legislature — to expand the range of participation for groups that are genuinely interested in the initiative  regardless of their intellectual  political or organizational orientation. We are encouraging them to join the national effort until all forces are mobilized to bring about political stability and security in Iraq. As we are working tirelessly for a secure and stable Iraq  we are also striving to re-establish an advanced and developed State where everybody can enjoy peace and security. We aspire to that not only for Iraq  but also for all States of the Middle East. This reflects Iraq’s concern  despite its preoccupation with its internal situation    9 06-53317  about the suffering of its Arab brothers  especially the Palestinians.  Iraq recognizes the implications of the destruction suffered by the brotherly State of Lebanon and its proud people as a result of the Israeli military onslaught. Therefore  we call for implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy for resolving the Palestinian question  which is at the core of this chronic conflict. We call for implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) concerning the brotherly State of Lebanon  which deserves sympathy and genuine support through funding and technology from all civilized nations  not solely from its Arab brethren.  The ongoing crises and wars in our region impose an enormous responsibility on the international community and the States of the region themselves to reach a just and permanent political settlement that would defuse crises  conflicts and wars. It also makes it incumbent upon us to reach a just and lasting peace that rids the area — and humanity — of the scourge of war  bloody conflict and terrorism.  Iraq  through its Minister of Foreign Affairs  has endorsed the latest decisions of the League of Arab States. Therefore  I call on the international community to accept these fair  logical proposals that are capable of ending strife and achieving security and peace for the peoples of the region.  States with influence at the international level have weightier responsibilities because of the strategic importance of the Middle East with respect to the policies  economies and global objectives of those influential States. They should  therefore  adopt a decisive approach in endorsing solutions that respect the rights and interests of the States and peoples of the region  as provided for in United Nations resolutions and human rights law. The decisive factor in establishing a firm foundation for a regional understanding  leading to just solutions  to a permanent peace based on transparency and the principle of respect for the rights of all parties and to stability in the Middle East  is embodied in collaborative efforts  the will of neighbouring countries and a serious resolve to defeat terrorism and eliminate its hotbeds and causes. A global war on terrorism limited only to military means will not be sufficient to defeat terrorism. We should  therefore  explore and adopt political  economic and other means and tools to strengthen the elements that will lead to victory in that war. In our view  it is beneficial here to consider General Assembly resolution 60/4  which calls on Governments  the United Nations and civil society organizations to develop ways and means in that direction and to work to promote a culture of peace and to condemn violence. It also calls for the formulation of ways and means to expand the circle of dialogue among civilizations in its religious  cultural and civil society dimensions.  What I have referred to serves to strengthen Iraq’s vision of making the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction — especially nuclear weapons — similar to zones in Africa and Latin America. Such zones safeguard the right of countries to develop technical capacity for the scientific and peaceful use of nuclear energy in order to achieve the goals of sustainable development. In that regard  I would like to emphasize that  in accordance with its permanent constitution and its higher national interests  the new Iraq is committed not to produce such weapons. Iraq will also join the Chemical Weapons Convention and other international instruments pertaining to such weapons.  We would like to take this opportunity to emphasize that there are no weapons of mass destruction of any type in the new Iraq  as has been confirmed in the reports of the most recent United Nations team to visit Iraq. Given that fact  and taking into account the interests of our country  we urge the Security Council to dissolve the United Nations Monitoring  Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC)  either by decommissioning it or by transforming it into an international body associated with the United Nations and funded through the Organization’s regular budget. UNMOVIC  which in its current form is financed through Iraqi accounts  is a waste of Iraq’s resources. Our people are in desperate need of those funds at this point in our country’s development.  Major international objectives can only be achieved by joining efforts and harnessing the goodwill of the international community in the service of all humankind. The United Nations has taken it upon itself to play a constructive role in establishing global environment conducive to international peace and security.     06-53317 10   Changes on the international stage oblige us to keep abreast of progress in every field  so as to enable the United Nations to carry out its functions. That should be done by better utilizing resources and capabilities to benefit the peoples of the world  as well as by strengthening the role of the Organization in the maintenance of international peace and security. There is also a need to respect the principle of the equality of all countries and their right to participate in the formulation and adoption of decisions and policies that affect the international community.   We also need to establish appropriate democratic mechanisms to make possible the participation of countries with the desire and capabilities to support efforts and decisions conducive to the implementation of programmes and the achievement of our common goals. In that connection  we believe that the reform of the international Organization must take account of the interests of all  and must seek to bring about equality and justice by reaching a balance through transparency and consensus.  In the light of those principles  Iraq appreciates the effective role played by the United Nations to resolve international problems. We are grateful to Mr. Ashraf Qazi  the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq for the role he is playing. Iraq hopes that the specialized agencies and programmes of the United Nations will return to Iraq to resume their part in its development and reconstruction.  In that context  I cannot fail to refer to the International Compact with Iraq. The Compact is the result of an initiative by the Government of Iraq to establish an international contact group that brings together countries and organizations willing to help Iraq and promote its reconstruction efforts. The group will also help establish a sustainable partnership between Iraq and the international community to overcome the challenges resulting from our economic and political transition. It is our hope that the international community will fulfil its obligations by providing the resources required to address key priorities and achieve a common vision in the framework of an economic transformation process and a sustainable development programme through agreed mechanisms.   I express our gratitude to the ministers for foreign affairs who took part in the successful meeting on the Compact that was held in this building a few days ago. The meeting proved that the new Iraq is no longer isolated from the international community. It also illustrated the fact that the new Iraq is on its way to assuming its proper place in a free and developed world.   With regard to reconstruction and the commitments of donor States towards Iraq  we would like to thank those States that are providing assistance to effectively contribute to generating optimism vis-à-vis leaving the past behind  launching the reform process and achieving comprehensive development. However  we also look forward to further support and determination in fulfilling those commitments  because we believe that launching reconstruction projects and stimulating the economy will be decisive in strengthening the security situation and restoring stability to Iraq  the region and the whole world. In that connection  I would like to emphasize that  with our free national will  we are committed to moving forward in reconstructing and implementing our national development programmes and plans.   We believe that it is our right to seek the cancellation of the numerous and exorbitant reparations payments and debts of the new democratic Iraq  which must not be made to pay for the sins of a dictatorship that committed many crimes against its people and betrayed the nation. Iraq believes that achieving sustainable development goes hand in hand with respecting human rights  providing security  achieving justice  ensuring the fair distribution of wealth and developing the agricultural  economic and service sectors.   In order to rise to the challenge posed by those tasks  we must respect women and their rights and ensure that they play their role in the development process and in the political arena. That goal has now become a firm principle in our pursuits  as stipulated in the Iraqi constitution  which confirmed the right of women to contribute to our country by holding no less than 25 per cent of the seats in the Council of Representatives. Iraqi women also now head four ministries in the Iraq Government of National Unity.  In conclusion  I would like to address anyone and everyone who harbours doubts that we are as committed and determined as we were three years ago   11 06-53317  to achieving national reconciliation. I assure them that the reconciliation process is a promising one. It is receiving all possible support and is moving forward with the backing of all political blocs. Our efforts will be focused on making reconciliation a permanent living reality that reflects the aspirations and hopes of the people of Iraq. That is especially so given that important steps have been taken that have resulted in national consensus and support from all the influential political forces in the country. We have also succeeded in charting a road map to resolve all remaining key issues  including those pertaining to the constitution  federal regions  militias  oil  de-Baathification and the new national flag  emblem and anthem.  As we underscore our determination  we also express the hope that Arab and regional parties  including neighbouring countries in particular  will share our determination and make every effort to halt any activities  support for or encouragement of the forces of terrorism — including those who label others as infidels and the remnants of dictatorial fascist gangs in the country. We also call upon neighbouring States to take the necessary measures to seal their borders against infiltrators.  We reaffirm our keen desire for security and safety for all our neighbours. We also express our adherence to the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States  so as to prevent our territory from being used as a staging ground to carry out acts against our neighbours. However  our people’s patience is wearing thin  in particular when we see the blood of our innocent sons and daughters being spilled and defiled  our infrastructure destroyed  our mosques and holy shrines ruined and the rebuilding of our armed forces and security services impeded in an attempt to delay the achievement of full sovereignty. It is difficult for our political leadership to keep quiet forever.   The ferocity of the terrorist attacks that target our people and country will not dissuade us from working persistently and with unwavering determination to defeat the terrorists. In so doing  we shall rely on our people’s vigilance  our political forces and our military and security capabilities  which are visibly being developed and strengthened in a number of Iraq’s governorates as the tide of terrorism recedes.    The building of Iraq’s national armed forces and its strengthening to the desired levels continues apace  in an effort to ensure that our capabilities reach the necessary level  degree of competency and readiness to gradually bring about the departure of Coalition forces from our country. Those forces are present in Iraq in accordance with an international resolution. In the current circumstances  their presence is essential as we carry out the task of building up our armed forces that will be capable of putting an end to terrorism and of maintaining stability and security. Once that has been achieved  it will then be possible to talk about a timetable for the withdrawal of multinational forces from Iraq.  The President returned to the Chair.  At this point  I would like once again to express our gratitude to the forces that participated in liberating our country from the worst dictatorship in history. In particular  we would like to thank President George W. Bush for his leadership in the campaign to liberate Iraq from tyranny and opening up the way for a new  democratic  pluralistic and federal Iraq that is at peace with itself and the world. That historic mission has well served the people of Iraq and peace and security in the region.   In conclusion  allow me  on behalf of the people and Government of Iraq to congratulate you  Madam President Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We wish you every success in achieving the goals set for this session  and we reaffirm our determination to cooperate with you fully in that noble undertaking.   I also wish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude and appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his dedicated efforts to re-energize the United Nations to work towards international peace and security and to promote development and respect for human rights throughout the world.

"81",3402,"ISL",61,2006,"Let me begin by congratulating you  Madam President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I am especially pleased to see a woman in this important position after a break of nearly 30 years. I join those who have expressed thanks to the Secretary-General for his leadership and commitment in recent years in addressing the very serious challenges facing the international community.     06-53609 14   Allow me also to take this opportunity to congratulate the Republic of Montenegro on its accession to membership of the United Nations.  The commitment to global partnership for development is a timely  yet sobering  theme in light of the long road we have still to travel and the setbacks already encountered. A major setback has been the crisis in global trade talks. Trade can be the single most important vehicle for global development  and we should not let the opportunity presented to us by the Doha Development Agenda slip from our grasp. We must ensure that gains from trade liberalization benefit the poor and are fairly distributed. Iceland remains strongly committed to the Agenda.  Many developing countries  particularly in sub-Saharan Africa  have little chance of achieving the Millennium Development Goals by the target date  unless significant additional resources are made available. We welcome and support international efforts for debt relief to the poorest countries. We also applaud those countries that have committed to increasing official development assistance. Iceland is also shouldering its responsibility. Over the next three years Iceland’s development assistance will have almost tripled in size  and we are determined to do even more. Beyond 2009 our assistance should increase even further  with the ambition of reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income.  The global partnership rests on the principles of transparency  accountability  good governance  equity and commitment to poverty reduction. Iceland also attaches special importance to the rights of women and children. As the Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner  Shirin Ebadi  so rightly pointed out in her Nobel Peace Prize Lecture on 10 December 2003   “To disregard women and bar them from active participation in political  social  economic and cultural life would in fact be tantamount to depriving the entire population of every society of half its capability.”   We want to see more determined efforts by development partners and United Nations agencies to pursue gender equality. The work of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) must be given more weight within the United Nations. Iceland has increased its support for the work of UNIFEM more than tenfold over the past two years  and we will increase our support even further.   The mission statement of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) correctly insists that the survival  protection and development of children are central to human progress. Nobody questions this statement  yet more than 10 million children die from preventable causes every year. Iceland will further increase its contributions to the vital work of UNICEF. I am proud to say that the people of Iceland have been particularly active and make the highest contribution per capita of national societies to UNICEF.  At least half of the eight Millennium Development Goals relate to resource use and environmental conservation  that is  to sustainable development. We will not be able to eradicate extreme poverty or hunger if we cannot safeguard the environment  the basis of food security around the world. We cannot hope to reduce child mortality unless we deal with the contamination of fresh water. There is a close relationship between the health of the earth’s ecosystem and human welfare  security and peace. Icelanders base their livelihood on the living resources of the sea and abundant renewable energy. Iceland rose from relatively recent poverty to affluence through the application of technological innovations and by drawing on international cooperation. We are convinced that our success could be replicated in many other parts of the world  given the right incentives and an enabling environment.  In this connection  I should like to refer in particular to two areas of sustainable development: ocean issues and energy issues.   Ocean issues have far-reaching development implications. Ninety-five per cent of those who make their living from fisheries are in the developing world. A billion people depend on fisheries for their main intake of protein. At the same time  we are seeing a rapid increase in pollution of the ocean and depletion of its living resources. That is why Iceland has prioritized this area in its development cooperation and in the work of the fisheries department of the United Nations University in Iceland.   Energy issues also loom large. While Icelanders enjoy the good fortune of having clean  renewable energy for 70 per cent of our total energy use  energy issues are increasingly becoming one of the main drivers of the sustainable development agenda within   15 06-53609  the United Nations. Two billion people lack access to electricity. All eight Millennium Development Goals will require greater energy consumption.   Unfortunately  more energy consumption in most cases means greater greenhouse gas emissions. One of our greatest challenges today is to square the development circle  to meet our development needs while safeguarding the environment. One way certainly is to increase substantially the share of renewables in world energy demand. That is why Iceland is taking an active part in promoting renewables and new technologies through its development cooperation and the work of the geothermal department of the United Nations University. Another example of our commitment in this area is the international seminar on hydrogen use for the developing world  to be held in Reykjavik later this week. It will be co-hosted by Iceland and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.  Much has been achieved over the past 12 months in implementing the outcome of the World Summit. In this connection  I join others in expressing appreciation for the outstanding work done by Jan Eliasson as President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. We now have a Peacebuilding Commission. The new Human Rights Council has also been established. It is the duty of all of us to make sure that we strengthen its credibility and turn it into a powerful defender and reinforcer of basic human rights. Its credibility will depend to a large extent on its even-handedness.   Useful work has already been done on internal reform of the United Nations. The success of these reforms — I think in particular of the mandate review — will affect the long-term credibility of the United Nations. It is with great interest and high hopes that we await the outcome of the work of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence.  Peace and security is fundamental to implementing a global partnership for development. In the face of the crippling effects of terrorism  we welcome the agreement on the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. In the fight against terrorism  human rights must not be compromised; otherwise  we undermine the values that we seek to defend. Torture cannot be justified. As we have seen recently  years of careful development can be reversed almost overnight by war. Conflict prevention  restraint by the parties involved and a commitment by other actors to urge restraint  rather than encourage conflict  are also fundamental to the partnership.  Sixty years ago  on 19 November 1946  Iceland became a Member of the United Nations. Iceland has since then strongly supported the principles of the United Nations as written in the Charter. With the full support of the other Nordic countries — Denmark  Finland  Norway and Sweden — Iceland decided in 1998 to present for the first time its candidature for a seat on the Security Council for the period 2009-2010  with elections to be held in 2008. This candidature  which was declared within the Western European and Others Group in April 2000  is based on our readiness to shoulder the responsibility of serving on the United Nations body charged with maintaining and strengthening peace and security. As one of the almost 100 smaller States of the United Nations  Iceland makes every endeavour to cultivate mutually beneficial relations with all Members of the Organization and believes itself to be favourably positioned to exercise with fairness and firmness the role of a Security Council member.  The task of building a global partnership for development is not easy. But it is the only way in which we can realistically address the challenges facing us  whether they be challenges of poverty  security  the environment or health. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan has put it  “the cause of larger freedom can only be advanced by broad  deep and sustained global cooperation among States”. "
"82",3449,"ISR",61,2006,"These days  the days of the general debate of the General Assembly  fall this year at a time of unique significance for the Jewish people. They come on the eve of the Jewish New Year and the Day of Atonement and are known as the Days of Awe.  In Jewish tradition  these are days of soul-searching and prayer  of judgement and of renewal. That concept of reflection is fitting not just for the faithful. It should be a time of reflection for nations as well. Let us use this time and this gathering to look deeply and honestly at the world in which we live — the world as it is and as it might be. The United Nations emerged from the horrors of war and offered a vision of a new and peaceful world  but we see the suffering of the people of Darfur  we see bloodshed and violence across the globe  and we know that that is not yet the world in which we live.  Our planet remains torn by conflict  At its heart  this is a conflict about values — a battle of ideas. It is a conflict about whether to respect or to reject the other — a conflict between tolerance and tyranny  between the promise of coexistence and the hopelessness of hate. We see it played out in internet chat rooms and in houses of prayer  in classrooms and newsrooms  on the battlefield and in the corridors of power. It is the challenge of our time.  We  the people of Israel  have lived for many years on the frontlines of this conflict. Our nation has felt its fury; our soldiers have fought and died in its battles. An ancient people in the heart of the Middle East — great in history but small in number — we have been a constant target of those that oppose our very existence. We face this conflict on different fronts — as Jews against the dark forces of anti-Semitism  as Israelis against the enemies of our statehood  and as members of the free world against the merchants of global terror.  We have been guided in this conflict by two core values that are embodied in our declaration of independence and shape our national identity. The first is that Israel  with Jerusalem at its heart  is the national homeland of the Jewish people  their refuge from persecution  their first and last line of defence. The second is that Israel is a democracy and that the values of justice  peace and humanity — first expressed by the prophets of Israel — are an integral part of our nation’s sense of mission. We share the same values as the community of democratic States. We are ready and proud to be judged by them. They are our own.     06-52885 44   But too often there is a gap between perception and reality. Too often  Israel is not seen for its unique creativity and spirit of enterprise  or for its contribution — well beyond its size — to the sciences and to literature  to human development and innovation. In many parts of the world  we are seen mainly through the lens of the Arab-Israeli conflict. And too often  that lens is distorted. To many  this conflict is portrayed as a clash of David and Goliath  with Israel perceived unjustly as Goliath  but this simplistic image ignores the fact that Israel remains a threatened democracy in a hostile region.  We have  of necessity  the capacity to defend ourselves  but we will always be constrained in its use by our values. And yet  we face an enemy willing to use all the means at its disposal to kill without restraint and without distinction. Every innocent casualty in this conflict is a tragedy. There is no difference between the tears of a grieving Israeli mother and a grieving Palestinian mother  but there is a critical moral difference between the terrorists who hunt down civilians and the soldiers who target terrorists while trying to avoid civilian casualties.  To protect its integrity  the international community must uphold that basic moral distinction. Terror is terror  even when it is called resistance. It cannot be justified and it cannot be equated with the actions of those seeking only to defend themselves against it.  If we want to protect our values  it is not enough to believe in them — we must act according to them. There is no greater challenge to our values than that posed by the leaders of Iran. They deny and mock the Holocaust. They speak proudly and openly of their desire to wipe Israel off the map. And now  by their actions  they pursue the weapons to achieve that objective  to imperil the region and to threaten the world. The moment of truth is here.  The international community is faced with no greater responsibility than to stand against that dark and growing danger — not for Israel’s sake  but for its own; for the sake of the values it claims to embrace; for the sake of the world we all wish our children to inherit. What more needs to happen for the world to take the threat seriously? What more needs to happen to end the hesitation and the excuses? We know the lessons of the past. We know the consequences of appeasement and indifference. There is no place for such leaders in this forum. There is no place for such a regime in the family of nations.  For any who still had doubts  the Iranian threat was exposed to all in the recent conflict in Lebanon. Armed  financed and directed by Iran  Hizbullah kidnapped Israeli soldiers and targeted Israeli cities  but it was the hopes of an entire region that they sought to take hostage. Out of the conflict — and because of Israel’s response to it — opportunity has emerged  but much is needed to turn opportunity into reality. Hizbullah can never again be allowed to threaten the future of the region. The world faces a critical test — to ensure the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006) and the immediate and safe release of the Israeli hostages.  As we gather here  we think of anxious families that ache for the return of their loved ones — parents waiting for a son  a brother for a brother  a wife for a husband. Israel will not rest until all the Israeli hostages are returned safely to the arms of their devoted families and to the embrace of a loving nation. Let us all make them the same promise today.  Last year  a great leader of Israel  Ariel Sharon  stood before this forum and said:   “The Palestinians will always be our neighbours. We respect them and have no aspirations to rule over them. They are also entitled to freedom and to a national  sovereign existence in a State of their own.” (A/60/PV.5  p.46)  That was not only the voice and vision of one man. It is the voice and vision of a nation. We do not believe that Israeli-Palestinian relations are of necessity a zero-sum game. Not every Israeli interest is at odds with Palestinian interests. There is  in fact  a common vision that binds together Israelis  moderate Palestinians and the international community. It serves the goals of both peoples and represents the basis of a genuine and lasting peace. At its heart is the vision of two States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. Israel believes in this vision  and from this vision we have drawn our principles for peace.  The first is inherent in the very idea of two States. For the Jewish people  Israel was established to be our national homeland. It was the solution for Jewish refugees and the realization of Jewish rights. And this is the true calling of the future State of   45 06-52885  Palestine: a national homeland for the Palestinian people — the solution to Palestinian claims  the fulfilment of Palestinian dreams  the answer for Palestinian refugees  wherever they may be. If Palestinian leaders are unwilling to say this  the world should say it for them. Instead of giving false hope  it is time to end the exploitation of the refugee issue and to begin to resolve it on the basis of the vision of two States  two homelands.   That is the real and only meaning of the two-State vision. It requires each people to accept that their rights are realized through the establishment of their own homeland  not in the homeland of others.   The second principle for peace is drawn from the concept of living in peace and security. On the basis of this principle the international community has insisted that the State of Palestine that emerges next to Israel cannot be a terror State. A terrorist State is the last thing our troubled region needs. It is for that reason that the road map requires an end to terror. It is for that reason that the international community has demanded that any Palestinian Government fulfil three basic conditions: renounce terrorism  recognize Israel’s right to exist and accept existing Israeli-Palestinian agreements. Those conditions are not an obstacle to peace or to the establishment of a responsible Palestinian State; they are a crucial ingredient for the realization of those goals.   An end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will also require agreement on a common boundary. There are those who believe that if only we could turn back the hands of time to 1967 all would be resolved. But  in 1967 there was no Palestinian State; there was no link between the West Bank and Gaza; and there was no commitment to lasting peace. A two-State solution requires the creation of a new reality which never existed in the past. For it to succeed  both sides will need to commit themselves to compromise and to believe in coexistence.  If only we could end the conflict today. But we have learned from bitter experience that to reach lasting peace it is not enough to have a vision. Peace must be built on the solid foundations of shared values  not the shifting sands of false promises. Without this  the political horizon will always be out of reach. We have seen negotiations doomed by mistrust and frustration. We have seen them lay the ground for greater violence  not greater understanding. We cannot afford to repeat that experience.  Unfortunately  the Palestinian Authority is dominated today by a terrorist organization that teaches children to hate and seeks to transform the conflict from a resolvable political dispute into an endless religious confrontation. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the consequence and not the cause of this ideology of intolerance and hatred. We cannot reach peace by ignoring these realities. We cannot find the solutions for tomorrow without addressing the problems of today.  But we also cannot give up hope  and I refuse to do so. In a Middle East where being moderate is often the same as being weak  our challenge is to empower the peacemakers and disempower their opponents. The road map phases and the three international conditions are designed precisely for that purpose. But if the world hesitates in enforcing these standards  the extremists sense opportunity. And if it appeases  they sense victory. This is the moment for determination not half-measures and vague formulations. It is the moment to demand that those Palestinian leaders that believe in peace determine the future on these terms  not on the terms of terrorists.  Unfortunately  there are no shortcuts on the road to peace. But stagnation is not in our interest  and it is not our policy.  It is in this spirit that Israel embarked on the painful process of disengagement  to create an opportunity for progress. But  sadly  we received terror in return. And it is in this spirit that I met with Chairman Abbas two days ago  and we agreed to re-energize the dialogue between us and create a permanent channel to pursue ways to advance together. The parties do not need another forum to act out their differences  and the only forum that will resolve them is the bilateral negotiating table. We have no illusions about the difficulties before us. We must face them not ignore them. But we can advance along the road to peace if we have the strength to defend its principles and the courage to confront its enemies.  In these days  while Jews prepare to welcome a new year  Muslims around the world prepare for the holy month of Ramadan. As two great faiths begin their annual journey of reflection and decision  let the nations of the world begin it too.    06-52885 46   The Jewish prayers tell us that this is a time of decision not just for individuals but also for States: “which for the sword and which for peace  which for famine and which for plenty”.  Those are sobering words  but they are also empowering ones. The message of these special days is that no future is predetermined; no conflict is inevitable. It is up to us to make the right choices. History will judge us by them. In the words of the traditional greeting: may the curses of the last year end; may the blessing of the new year begin. Shana tova: may it be a good year. "
"83",3496,"ITA",61,2006,"I wish to offer you my congratulations  Madam President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your experience in international affairs is the best guarantee of the success of your term. At the same time I express to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  our sincere thanks for his effective and    06-52879 16  balanced leadership of the sixtieth session. My special appreciation goes also to Kofi Annan for having dedicated his life to the Organization  particularly in the past 10 years as Secretary-General  leading it through difficult challenges and laying the groundwork for its reform. Thank you  Kofi.  It was in this city on 11 September five years ago that the dramatic realization was forced upon us of just how dangerous the world has become. On that day we knew that the new millennium would hold unpredictable and complex threats extending beyond national borders; global threats against which notions of protection inside national borders are illusory; asymmetrical threats that are difficult to counter effectively with the instruments previously used to settle conflicts.  Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction have changed traditional society and its values. They have rendered obsolete systems of collective defence and security based on deterrence. The old solutions to the world’s problems — the logic of balance and hegemony — are no longer enough to guarantee stability and security. These new threats add a new element to a list that includes regional conflicts in the Middle East  Asia and Africa; pandemics; problems of development and the gap between North and South; human rights abuses; mass migrations; and issues concerning energy and the environment. These are phenomena that it is also impossible to resolve without a collective assumption of responsibility.  If we wish to govern these phenomena we need to be equal to their dimensions. No country  however strong and powerful  can take on such complex challenges single-handedly. Global threats demand a global response. In the final analysis  this means collective partnership. To have chosen as the theme of the sixty-first session “Implementing a global partnership for development” was thus particularly appropriate. Without collective action by the countries in the northern and southern hemispheres  international organizations and institutions  the public and private sector and civil society  it will be impossible to achieve the goals we have set.  First and foremost we need to reinvigorate multilateralism  by which I mean above all restoring the central  fundamental role of the United Nations. The recent experience in Lebanon and the strengthening of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is one example of how the United Nations can regain its crucial importance in the resolution of international controversies. Above all  it demonstrates — and this is the key point — that if the stakeholders are willing to confer upon the United Nations a strong  central role  the Organization is well able to fulfil it.  In Lebanon we are still at square one  and much remains to be done. To underestimate the risk of this mission would be a serious mistake. We must  however  be pleased with how the United Nations  its Member States and — allow me to add — the European Union have addressed a situation that only two months ago risked getting out of hand  but which today presents a series of opportunities for the Middle East as a whole. We should be pleased to have set up a mission that represents the entire international community  a tangible expression of the very global partnership that we are discussing today. For  while it is true that Europe provides the backbone of UNIFIL  it cannot carry out its mission effectively without the contributions of China  India  Indonesia  Malaysia  Russia  Turkey and the many other non-European countries participating.  The question we must ask at this point is this: what do we need to do in order to continue the work just begun in Lebanon? More generally  in view of the crises and emergencies that surround us  what does the United Nations need in order to fulfil the principles of the Charter? It needs two things: first  quick completion of the reforms  and  secondly  the strong and unconditional support of its Members.  On the issue of reform  last year  after an intense series of negotiations  a moment of summary allowed us to lay the groundwork for giving the United Nations a more incisive role  to the benefit of the international community. The Peacebuilding Commission is the first major result  because it highlights the indestructible bond between development  security and human rights. A priority commitment to human rights and their safeguarding should be the goal of any country that wishes to lend greater ethical authority to its foreign policy. The results achieved by the reform on this point  through the establishment of the new Human Rights Council  are still being examined. The other significant outcome is the affirmation of the principle of the responsibility to protect  so that the international community will no longer be indifferent to acts of genocide.   17 06-52879   But it is on the General Assembly and the Security Council that we must focus our attention  by restoring the central role of the General Assembly as the main decision-making  representative and policy-making body of the United Nations; and by renewing efforts to reform the Security Council  in terms both of its working methods and its composition. In the current situation Member States thus need to send a strong political signal that will help us to begin a new chapter and open the way to an innovative approach.  In other words  we need to enter a period of negotiation which has thus far eluded us  a period in which  rather than seeking to impose positions and models  we can undertake a true comparison of positions for the purpose of achieving solutions that are not divisive but  rather  enable the widest possible consensus. But a word of caution: everything is negotiable except for the ownership of the Organization by the Member States  by all of us  an ownership that represents the true pillar on which United Nations multilateralism must rest.  Another way for the United Nations to regain the forcefulness and credibility it needs to fulfil its mission is by strengthening the role of its great regional stakeholders. I am thinking first of the European Union  because if Europe is stronger the United Nations will be stronger. The world and the United Nations do not need a Europe that hesitates. Rather  they need a Europe that is able to play its part in meeting the challenges that await us. Europe  in turn  must become more aware that only by contributing to the resolution of global tensions can it give greater security and prosperity to its citizens.  The conditions for performing this role are there. The numbers alone make the European Union a global actor — 25 countries with a total population of more than 450 million  representing one fourth of the world’s gross domestic product and every month allocating €500 million to third countries. Yet these numbers do not correspond to a comparable ability for the European Union to make a difference outside its own borders.  In the work of the Assembly and its various committees  the European Union is becoming a key actor. At every debate and on every resolution its position represents a point of reference in shaping the attitudes of the other regional groups. Our goal should be to acquire a similar ability within the Security Council. It may be a slow process  which will have to take into account points of resistance and stubborn legacies  but it should be pursued with determination. Only if Europe wields a more incisive influence on the issues of peace and security can it be considered a true global actor. The Balkan tragedies in the early 1990s were the result of an absent Europe. But when it is present  and when it is united  Europe can make the difference. That is what we are seeing in the Lebanese crisis. During the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  and in the course of its biennium in the Security Council  Italy will make a special effort to increase the commitment and role of the European Union at the United Nations.  Our aim is to make the Organization more effective in the areas and on the issues in which  by history and vocation  it can provide the most added value. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  in particular nuclear weapons  has to be seen today in the context  above all  of the negotiation under way with Iran. But it is our duty to look further ahead and to strive  all together  to consolidate the general non-proliferation system. That principle will inspire the action of Italy when it enters the Security Council.  With regard to the Iranian nuclear file  we are ready to make our contribution to a negotiated solution that promotes regional security and stability.  In the Middle East  as I mentioned earlier  we need to seize our opportunities and openings   aware that there will be no peace until the Palestinian question has been resolved  with an independent  sovereign  vital and contiguous Palestinian state next to the state of Israel  and both within secure and internationally recognized borders.  That grave regional crisis should not lead us to forget Africa — long suffering  prey to ongoing crises  and even poorer than it was two decades ago. The situation in Darfur is critical. We cannot stand by and watch  for the simple reason that time has run out. We need to act quickly and strive for a gradual assumption of responsibility by the United Nations  in compliance with the decisions of the Security Council. The situation in the Horn of Africa is also a source of concern. Here a strong commitment is required from the Security Council  where  starting on 1 January 2007  Italy will make its contribution also  on the basis of its experience in the region. When I speak of Africa     06-52879 18  I mean primarily the gap between the northern and southern hemispheres  the phenomenon at the root of almost all the ills afflicting our era. It is that gap  above all  that causes the massive migratory flows that we cannot ignore and that we must address with realism  responsibility  equanimity  and especially solidarity.  In the Mediterranean we are working with our partners to address immigration on the basis of those principles  and seeking to facilitate legal flows and to counter both the illegal flows and the parties that profit from them  seeking to facilitate the integration into our countries of those who have immigrated legally  filled with hope and the desire to work.  But there is another dangerous gap that risks leaving an even deeper gash in the world. I am referring to what until a few years ago was called a clash of civilizations and religions between the Christian and Islamic worlds. I refuse to believe that such a clash exists. Extremists and fanatics do exist  but civilizations and religions were made for the sake of dialogue  exchange and mutual enrichment. We can promote  and we want to promote  this relationship by building new policies to bring us closer to the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean  with the goal of making that sea a basin of peace and harmonious coexistence among diverse civilizations and religions.  Let me return to the central issue of this session  the global partnership for development  in order to clarify one point. There is a risk that the reinvigoration of multilateralism  United Nations reform  and a collective commitment to the various theatres of crisis will produce no lasting effect unless development issues are treated as priorities. It is up to the United Nations as the driving force  the glue of solidarity among peoples  and the fullest expression of multilateralism  to keep development at the top of the international agenda. For it is in the connection between security  solidarity and development that the added value of the United Nations lies  in the full awareness that there can be no peace without development and no development without peace.  It is not enough to enunciate at this rostrum  as speakers have been doing for six years now  the words “Millennium Development Goals”. We must get to work and carry them out  starting with the adoption of the financial  trade  technological and environmental steps required and aiming for a very specific  ambitious goal that responds above all to a moral duty: to guarantee a dignified life for every human being.  I wish to conclude with a few considerations on the fundamental principles and values that inspire our action when we deal with multilateralism  the search for peace  security and development  and north-south relations. All these issues coalesce in a defence of life and struggle against all forms of hatred  violence  discrimination and marginalization  undeniable values that  together with democratic principles  are the foundations of coexistence among peoples and should inspire the action of the world’s nations. Today  sadly  these values are still denied and trampled upon  as if we had learned nothing from the horrors of the past. We cannot sit by watching indifferently in the face of barbarous acts. We are for peace and solidarity. We are against the death penalty  injustice and human suffering. That is something we must always remember  especially on the eve of major decisions. That is what is expected of us from those who sacrificed their lives for peace  for a righteous cause  for an ideal  to defend freedom  the same freedom that we enjoy every day in a democracy. "
"84",3542,"JAM",61,2006,"It is an honour for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-first session on behalf of my country  Jamaica.  I would like to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the Assembly. It is a particular pleasure for me today to acknowledge that achievement  as she is one of only three women in the history of the General Assembly to have occupied that post  and — significantly — the first since 1969  nearly 40 years ago.  I would also take this opportunity to express deep appreciation for the work carried out during the sixtieth session of the Assembly by Mr. Jan Eliasson  under whose leadership so much was accomplished in an extraordinarily challenging year  notably the adoption of the World Summit Outcome Document.  As we begin this new United Nations year  we ask ourselves  “What is the state of our world?” We ask this particularly in the context of the determination and resolution of our leaders in 2005 to urgently address the issue of the storm clouds which were threatening the vast majority of humankind  particularly in the developing world. We see a continued challenging time ahead for development  for peace and security  for democracy and social institutions and for multilateralism. We see an environment in which the credibility of the international system to deliver fairly and equitably is being increasingly questioned.  These were the very issues and circumstances which world leaders sought to address at the beginning of the sixtieth session in 2005. Their Summit Outcome Document contained a raft of resolutions  commitments and recommendations to deal with fundamental issues and constraints  and was intended to give political momentum to achieving the commonly agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. The leaders  while recognizing that development  peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing  reaffirmed that development is a central goal in and of itself.  Jamaica remains deeply committed to the three pillars of the United Nations  but considers development to be at the very core. For this reason  Jamaica is concerned about the fact that we have not discerned any significant focus on implementation in the area of development over the past year — a year dedicated to implementation. The implementation gap has been greater in this area than in either of the other two areas.  Increased  albeit still insufficient  attention is being accorded to those who live in extreme poverty — those living on less than $1 per day. The Secretary-General cited some startling statistics in his report on    06-53615 22  the work of the Organization. I would like to refer to two examples: 10 million children die before their fifth birthday  and women in developing countries are 45 times more likely to die during pregnancy than women in developed countries. That is irrefutable evidence that the situation remains in absolute and comparative terms  deeply unsatisfactory and unsustainable in an interdependent world.  Jamaica and other developing countries consistently argued in all the debates leading up to and during the 2005 Summit that  in addition to the poorest countries  the situation of vulnerable middle- and lower- middle-income countries  especially small island and highly externally dependent economies  needed to be addressed. A number of potentially very useful provisions were incorporated into the Summit Outcome document to address their particular circumstances. But  frankly  Jamaica has seen little resolve on the part of the international community to implement those commitments. We have seen no work  for example  to implement the commitment to support the development efforts of middle-income developing countries to help them meet  among other things  their financial  technical and technological requirements. Nor have we seen any effort to develop a framework for providing significant debt relief or restructuring for middle-income developing countries with unsustainable debt burdens that are not part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative  or to comprehensively address the debt problems of those countries. Thirdly  there has been no effort to implement the development dimension of the Doha Work Programme  in particular the World Trade Organization’s Work Programme on Small Economies.  We recognize that there was a welcome increase in official development assistance from $69 million in 2003 to $106 million in 2005. Much of the additional funding was targeted to a small number of admittedly very deserving countries — mainly for debt relief — and to peacekeeping. There was little new money for investment in development projects  even in the poorest countries.  It has always been recognized that many of the resources for financing development must come from trade. That was clearly stated in the Monterrey Consensus (A/CONF.198/11) and repeated in the 2005 Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). In the Outcome Document  leaders of developed and developing countries committed to work expeditiously towards implementing the development dimensions of the Doha Work Programme. They also emphasized the need to address weak and volatile commodity prices and to support the efforts of commodity-dependent countries to restructure  diversify and strengthen the competitiveness of their commodity sectors.  Instead of expedition and facilitation  we have seen stalemate and breakdown in the Doha round of negotiations. Perhaps even more significant is the fact that  in the negotiations that did take place  the development dimension — especially as it relates to small and vulnerable economies such as that of Jamaica — was conspicuously absent from the debate. These issues must be addressed in any effort to restart the negotiations.  Jamaica strongly supports the view that fundamental to a viable and equitable trade regime is the need to take account of the wide disparity in structural characteristics and approaches to economic policy among the many members of the World Trade Organization  and the consequent need for flexibility. We would add  for clarity  the need to include the differences in levels of development among economies and the asymmetries existing between developed and developing countries.  As a small country with a debt burden of more than 125 per cent of its gross domestic product; a country whose exports have been falling in value and whose markets are threatened by the current uncritical approach to globalization and trade liberalization; a country dependent on imported petroleum for more than 90 per cent of its commercial energy and whose energy bill was more than $1 billion in 2005; an island vulnerable to a range of natural hazards and still working to recover from major hurricanes and droughts in 2004 and 2005; and a country whose skilled professionals — doctors  nurses  teachers and scientists in particular — are targeted by some major developed countries  Jamaica understands the need for a collaborative and facilitative international environment and for coherence in policies. Successful implementation of the Millennium Development Goals cannot be assured in the face of those challenges.  Jamaica recognizes that there can be no sustained development  no poverty eradication and no lasting peace without the advancement  equality and empowerment of women. Women’s advancement is a   23 06-53615  priority of our national policy  and we support all international initiatives to that end.  We are encouraged by action aimed at implementing some of the mandates agreed at the 2005 Summit. In the area of international peace and security  the Peacebuilding Commission has been established  with an emphasis on addressing post-conflict situations. Jamaica has the honour to be a founding member of that body and will be actively involved in the achievement of its objectives. With regard to human rights  the Human Rights Council has been established. In the field of humanitarian affairs  the Central Emergency Response Fund has been established  and an agreement has been reached on the protection of humanitarian personnel. We welcome the finalization of the draft Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities and look forward to its formal adoption later this year. We welcome also the 2006 Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (resolution 60/262)  adopted at the High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS. We urge the full implementation of those decisions to comprehensively tackle this scourge in the most seriously affected countries and regions. For the Caribbean region  HIV/AIDS is a major human  social and economic challenge.  The recent High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  convened in keeping with the mandate of the 2005 World Summit  and the publication of the United Nations Population Fund’s 2006 State of World Population report have been very timely. They highlighted  among other things  the multidimensional nature of international migration  its importance in the globalization process and the potential for further widening of the development gap between rich and poor countries. They raised a number of critical issues for the attention of the international community.   Jamaica is particularly concerned about the selectivity in the policies of developed countries  their deliberate targeting of critical skilled professionals of developing countries  accompanied by the tightening of their general immigration laws against the unskilled and the young  and their systematic and wholesale repatriation of those who run into difficulty with their laws — especially hardened criminals  many of whom have little or no connection  if they ever did  with the receiving developing country. Those policies are inconsistent  counterproductive and  with all due respect  frankly wrong. They demand the urgent attention of the international community. We look forward to these issues being studied and given the required attention at the follow-up meeting to be held in Belgium in March 2007.  We note the continued emphasis on the strengthening of the United Nations and the adoption of reform measures aimed at improving accountability and transparency and at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the work of the Secretariat in implementing the programmes mandated by Member States. We stress that reform should ensure the strengthening of the United Nations. That should be our motivation. We should never allow reform to erode the fundamental institutional framework of the United Nations or the right of each Member State to be fully involved in the Organization’s decision-making processes and to contribute to advancing its goals and ideals. That right has been the fundamental strength of the United Nations and what sets it apart from many other multilateral institutions. It is and should remain the standard.  Geopolitical realities have changed significantly since the establishment of the United Nations. It is therefore logical that the Security Council should be reflective of the contemporary international community as a whole  on the basis of equitable geographical representation and greater representation of developing countries. How can it be that less than 5 per cent of the membership of the Organization continues to wield inordinate power over the rest of us? That is undemocratic and  ultimately  unsustainable. It is on that basis that Jamaica supports expansion in both categories of Council membership  with increased representation for all regional groups.  Jamaica underscores the vital importance of coherence in policy action and advice among the United Nations and other international institutions  including the international financial institutions  as well as regional organizations  in the effort to facilitate and encourage development  especially that of the small  vulnerable and otherwise disadvantaged countries.  Over the years  Jamaica has experienced more than its fair share in terms of the adverse impact of incoherent international policies and advice. I will provide just three examples. First  Jamaica has been    06-53615 24  forced to hold a large fund of international reserves in developed countries. At the end of August 2006  Jamaica’s net international reserves stood at approximately $2.2 billion  or 18 weeks of imported goods and services  while the country needs foreign exchange to facilitate investment projects.   Secondly  Jamaica has entered into international commitments under the Millennium Development Goals  inter alia to expand education and health care  to enhance environmental protection  to strengthen rural development and to improve housing and sanitation. These are all labour-intensive activities. The International Monetary Fund  without providing any analysis  is giving advice and insisting that Jamaica reduce its public service drastically.   Thirdly  Jamaica is forced to compete with the salaries being offered by developed countries such as Canada  the United Kingdom and the United States to large categories of employees  including teachers and nurses  while seeking to reduce its fiscal deficit. This is one of the major difficulties that the Government is facing in its current wage negotiations with the members of some of these categories  with a view to completing its second memorandum of understanding with public sector workers.  The United Nations has a major responsibility to lead in the quest for coherence in international economic programmes and policies. Jamaica believes that a fortified United Nations  in particular a strengthened Economic and Social Council  is vital if that role is to be effective.  We continue to live in very turbulent times. Global peace  security and stability continue to be elusive. All the multilateral gains that we have made in recent years will come to little if existing conflict situations are not resolved and if new military interventions  acts of terrorism and other debilitating threats to peace  security and development arise.  We must continue to emphasize the critical importance of multilateral diplomacy  even-handedness and maximum restraint. We must reinforce the mutually beneficial relationships among us as a community of nations. We must equip the United Nations to act  and act decisively  when necessary. In that regard  we welcome Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and look forward to every effort being made to build on this new platform to secure a lasting peace in the Middle East.  We cannot remain indifferent to the tragic plight of the people of Darfur  the Sudan. History has repeatedly demonstrated that indifference emboldens those who seek to act with impunity  resulting in even greater atrocities and humanitarian crises. The international community must act urgently to promote human security and to protect the lives of innocent civilians.  Disarmament and non-proliferation go hand in hand. It is only through the total elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction that international peace and security can be assured. Jamaica is therefore disheartened that the international community failed to seize the opportunities provided by the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and by the World Summit to make significant progress on this issue.  Jamaica and other countries in the Caribbean region have to confront major security concerns as a result of the ease of access to illicit small arms and ammunition and the linkages to transnational organized crime  including drug trafficking. Jamaica feels a deep sense of disappointment that the 2006 Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects failed to conclude an outcome document which would have introduced improvements in the implementation of the Programme of Action. Jamaica will continue to advocate for the creation of a legally binding instrument which more strictly controls the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons and ammunition.  The recent adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) is a very clear demonstration that the international community can come together to confront major threats to civility  the rule of law and international peace and security. This should be our modus operandi.  We have been particularly encouraged by developments in Haiti  which have led to the democratic election of the Government of President René Préval. In July  Haiti was able to again take its rightful place in CARICOM. Coupled with the renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti until February 2007  attention can now be focused on institution- and capacity-building    25 06-53615  as well as on reconstruction and other initiatives for economic and social development in that country.  The bicentenary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the British Empire will be marked in 2007. For all CARICOM countries this is a special anniversary based on shared history. To symbolize the occasion  CARICOM members will be introducing a draft resolution at this session of the General Assembly with the expectation that the Assembly will appropriately recognize the event. We look forward to the support of all delegations.  Jamaica strongly reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations and the multilateral process. Our continued commitment at all levels  including our support for the work of the International Seabed Authority  remains firm.  Before closing  I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General for his outstanding leadership in guiding the work of the Organization over the past 10 years. He has faced the challenges of our times. He has re-engineered the position of Secretary-General to become the face  voice and conscience of the international community. He has brought civil society  non-governmental organizations and the private sector into the United Nations. He has leveraged and brought into international service high achievers in a range of disciplines. And he has increased opportunities for consultation and dialogue. We wish him the very best.  Jamaica looks forward to a transparent and inclusive process to provide our Organization with a new Secretary-General who enjoys the confidence of the full membership. "
"85",3588,"JOR",61,2006,"May I extend the warmest congratulations to you  Sheikha Haya  on your election as President of the General Assembly. Allow me also to say a word of gratitude and admiration to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Jordan applauds the progress achieved in United Nations reform under Secretary-General Annan’s tenure. In particular  we welcome the recent creation of the Human Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding Commission.  I come before the Assembly today with a deep sense of urgency. Never has it been more important for the world community to act decisively for peace in my region. The recent crisis in the Middle East is a crisis for all nations. There can be no just global order when aggression and occupation are permitted to take the place of international law. When these occur in a region as strategic as the Middle East  the shockwaves run worldwide. Our young people are asking  where is the justice  where is the will  of the global community? We must answer them by establishing a lasting peace    06-52737 10  based on the international legality that we have pledged to uphold.  That means a new focus on the core problem. The region’s contemporary crises are outgrowths of a central grievance felt throughout the Middle East and  indeed  the world. That grievance  plain and simple  is Israeli occupation and the denial  over decades  of Palestinian rights. Until we end that wrong  conflict will breed more conflict  year after year.  The Middle East conflict has repeatedly come before this institution. And the United Nations position has been repeatedly articulated in resolutions condemning aggression and occupation  affirming Palestinian self-determination and supporting a process for peace. Yet  each year without progress has brought us another crisis  more suffering and more division. It is time to take a better path.  We must  of course  respond immediately to help those who suffer the terrible destruction of conflict. In Lebanon we must ensure that the Government can extend its sovereignty and control over all Lebanese territory. The Arab world and the international community must make every effort and must support reconstruction and development. Those are vital measures; but in the Middle East they are only partial measures.  We can solve the Arab-Israeli conflict only by addressing the issue at its core: the restoration of internationally recognized Palestinian rights. In 2002  the 22 Arab States — agreeing unanimously — led the way with a breakthrough peace proposal. Our vision and our commitment is a viable and independent Palestinian State living side by side with a secure Israel. Under the Arab peace initiative  Israel’s security would be guaranteed and the occupation of Palestine would end  in accordance with United Nations resolutions.  Events show clearly that there can be no unilateral solution to the conflict. There must be a genuine partnership among all parties  in the context of international legality and justice.  Such a global partnership for peace is directly connected to the global partnership for development. Around the world  nations at peace are moving forward with economic growth and development: investing in education  building communities and helping to shape the future of the world. But no nation succeeds in isolation. All nations and all people — especially our young people — must be able to share in a promising future.  We must make peace a priority. We must do so now. No session of this great institution could make a greater contribution to a future of justice and hope. "
"86",3635,"JPN",61,2006,"I wish to congratulate Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her assumption of the presidency of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  and I wish her every success. I would also like to pay high tribute to the past President  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his outstanding leadership during the last session. Japan’s sincere thanks also go to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his dedication and many achievements in leading the work of the Organization over the past decade.  Japan congratulates the Republic of Montenegro on its accession to the United Nations as its 192nd Member.  Fifty years ago  in December 1956  from this very podium  the then Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan  Mamoru Shigemitsu  expressed the nation’s great honour and delight at becoming the eightieth Member   31 06-53615  of the United Nations and declared Japan’s firm determination to contribute to the high goals of this Organization.  Since then  Japan  as a nation committed to peace  has worked hard in promoting disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  supporting the undertakings of the United Nations for peace and stability in the world such as the peacekeeping operations  and contributing to world development and prosperity. The Japanese people take pride in the contributions they have made over the years to the United Nations.  The challenges we face today differ significantly from those of 50 years ago. Yet  the common goals of humanity that the United Nations has strived for — peace  development and human rights — remain unchanged. Japan reaffirms the commitment it made at the time of its accession  and  building on its experiences since then  will rededicate its efforts to achieve those goals.  As Member States  we are responsible  not only for the actions we take  but also for our inaction. Within the United Nations  it is the Security Council that bears the responsibility of delivering swift and decisive action in the face of a crisis. This summer  the ability of the international community to mount a collective response through the Security Council was tested on several occasions. Let me cite three major events on which the Council acted: the ballistic missile launches by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  Iran’s nuclear-related problem and the conflict in Lebanon.  After the launch of ballistic missiles by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on 4 July  the Security Council  in a unanimous decision in resolution 1695 (2006)  sent a firm message  on behalf of the entire international community  condemning that reprehensible act. In accordance with that resolution  all Member States are now required to take concrete action as specified therein  and call strongly on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to implement the resolution  fully and without delay. In that connection  Japan introduced on 19 September a set of measures for the prevention of the transfer of financial resources to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  in addition to the long-standing strict export control measures.  Furthermore  Japan will continue to make its utmost efforts so that the nuclear issue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  and the abduction issue will be resolved comprehensively and in accordance with the Pyongyang Declaration of 2002.  With regard to Iran’s nuclear issue  it is our belief that the adoption of resolution 1696 (2006) will serve as an important step towards a peaceful settlement of the issue through diplomatic negotiations. Japan strongly urges Iran to comply fully with the resolution by promptly suspending all enrichment-related activities  and to return to the negotiation process.  Concerning the recent crisis in Lebanon  Japan welcomes the adoption of resolution 1701 (2006) by the Security Council and supports the efforts under way for its implementation. At the same time  the protracted negotiating process for that resolution reminded us once again of the importance of the ability of the Council to respond  swiftly as well as comprehensively  in such a crisis situation. That is never an easy task  but one we must always strive to fulfil.  In response to some of the recent events affecting international peace and security  the Council succeeded in arriving at concrete decisions for the Member States to act upon. Japan is pleased to have played a proactive role in that process as a member of the Council  and we intend to cooperate closely with other Member States in following up on those resolutions.  In countries and regions emerging from conflict  the key to realizing sustainable peace and prosperity lies in the consolidation of peace and laying the foundations for nation-building. It is encouraging to see the ongoing  concerted efforts of the international community towards peace consolidation and nation-building in a number of countries and regions.  Iraq is one such country. Though currently still in the grip of great hardship  we have every confidence that Iraq will overcome the difficulties and develop as a democratic and stable State  and prosper as a responsible member of the international community. The International Compact for Iraq  which aims at forging a new mode of partnership between Iraq and the international community  will help accelerate the country’s reconstruction. Japan intends to fully take part in those international endeavours.    06-53615 32   In Afghanistan  Japan has also been an active supporter and a leading donor for its reconstruction and development. We have led the disarmament  demobilization and reintegration (DDR) efforts in collaboration with the United Nations  and  upon the successful completion of the DDR process  are now taking the lead in the projects for the disbanding of illegal armed groups.  With regard to Timor-Leste  Japan hopes that the newly established United Nations mission will effectively support the country’s nation-building efforts. As the lead country on Timor-Leste in the Security Council  Japan will continue to take the initiative to promote peace and stability and achieve the early restoration of law and order in that country.  In Africa  as a whole  we begin to see the situation on the continent moving towards less conflict and greater peace. The ministerial conference on the consolidation of peace  that was held under the framework of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in February this year  not only made an intellectual contribution to the understanding of peace consolidation  but also strengthened the will and solidarity of the African States for peacebuilding. Japan  for its part  has been expanding assistance for the consolidation of peace in Africa  with particular focus on the Sudan  the Great Lakes region and West Africa.   Against such a backdrop  the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission represents a significant milestone in the history of the United Nations. We must ensure that the Commission’s work is translated into tangible  practical value-added support to peacebuilding efforts in countries recovering from conflict and that it thus helps to make a difference on the ground. Burundi and Sierra Leone  the first two countries on the agenda of the Commission  will provide test cases  in which we must not fail. Japan has contributed $20 million to the Peacebuilding Fund and intends to contribute actively to the work of the Commission.  Post-conflict peacebuilding requires knowledge and expertise in a wide range of fields  including ceasefire monitoring  refugee assistance  administrative and judicial institution-building  and reconstruction and development. Our experts have been working in Asian countries to assist their peacebuilding efforts  such as the establishment of legal and judicial systems. In order to strengthen our cooperation in this area even further  we are now considering concrete measures to train civilians not only from Japan but also from other Asian countries. We envisage that  one day  civilian practitioners who have been trained in my country will find themselves working side by side as fellow Asian peacebuilders  including  for example  in Africa.  Regional conflicts continue to pose serious challenges. In addition  the Secretary-General  as he pointed out earlier from this rostrum  is concerned about “those who seem eager to foment a new war of religion” (). While poverty remains the main scourge in many developing countries  globalization has also brought to the fore transnational issues such as terrorism  infectious diseases and environmental degradation. It is clear that the international community still has a long way to go to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In tackling these issues  a spirit of tolerance  compassion and closer international cooperation is indispensable  and a strengthened United Nations must be at the centre of the concerted efforts of the international community. At the same time  new concepts should also propel these efforts. Japan has advocated the importance of human security as a concept that stresses the protection of individuals from threats to their life and dignity  as well as the value of their individual empowerment. Together with other interested countries  we will promote human security and the approach based on it during this General Assembly session.  Along with human security  respect for the ownership of developing countries  based on good governance  should be a pillar underpinning the strategy for reducing poverty through economic growth. Given these principles  Japan intends to enhance its development assistance to achieve the MDGs  by faithfully implementing the commitments made last year to increase the volume of its official development assistance (ODA) by $10 billion over a period of five years and to double its ODA to Africa over a period of three years. On trade  Japan will do its utmost to bring about the early resumption and successful conclusion of the WTO Doha Development Round negotiations.  Close international cooperation is vital in our fight against terrorism. In this regard  Japan welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution   33 06-53615  60/288) and calls for the early conclusion of negotiations on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism.   Health is another area in which Japan has worked extensively in cooperation with the international community  including efforts against avian and pandemic influenza and HIV/AIDS. Japan recognizes the importance of the activities of the World Health Organization and will further strengthen its cooperation with that organization  particularly in Africa.  As is often emphasized  peace  development and human rights are linked and complement one another. Japan’s own experience in the 60 years since the Second World War is eloquent testimony to this fact. We have high expectations for the newly created Human Rights Council and look to it to open a new page in the promotion of respect for human rights. As a member  Japan will play a constructive role in the Council. Japan also supports the early adoption of the draft conventions on enforced disappearance and on the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.  The United Nations has heavy responsibilities  in today’s and tomorrow’s world  as an indispensable global instrument for resolving conflicts  building peace  addressing emerging global threats and laying the foundation for prosperity. To fulfil such a mission  it must be efficient and effective  as well as accountable and broadly representative in its decisions and operations. Reform of the Organization’s structure and the manner in which it functions is  therefore  critically important. In September last year  leaders expressed their resolve to achieve comprehensive reform of this universal body. One year on  some encouraging progress has been made  including the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. However  reform of the Security Council remains outstanding on the institutional reform agenda.  Perhaps a limited few may find it in their interest to leave the Security Council configured in the way it was in 1945. It is clear  however  that no one stands to gain from the waning credibility that failure to reform could entail. The call for a more effective  representative and transparent Council that can meet the demands of the new century is not mere rhetoric; it is real and urgent. An overwhelming majority of the Member States  including Japan  agree that the international community should approach and carry out reform with a sense of urgency  and Japan is determined to continue to take the initiative in this critical endeavour. The Member States now need a new proposal on Security Council reform — one that is both creative and persuasive — in order to take an early decision during the current session of the General Assembly. At the same time  other important areas for reform must also be addressed. We need concrete results in management reform if we are to demonstrate that the United Nations is capable of reforming itself. It is also our hope that there will be a constructive dialogue on the question of United Nations system-wide coherence  based on the report of the High-level Panel to be issued later this year.  In this connection  I would also remind the Member States that world leaders resolved last year to delete the long-obsolete “enemy State” clauses from the United Nations Charter. This is another indication that the United Nations is ready to step out of the past and into the new era.  Having made a significant contribution to the activities of the United Nations since its inception  Japan has an exemplary record with regard to the fulfilment of its duties as a Member State  including assessed contributions. Nevertheless  we strongly believe that the United Nations needs a reformed scale-of-assessments structure — one that is more equitable and fair and duly takes into account the status and responsibilities of each Member State. Japan will work together with other Member States to formulate such a structure  which will bring financial stability to this Organization.  Our common task for the sixty-first session is to continue our work and translate the decisions on reform made at the World Summit into reality. Let us join forces once again and create an efficient and effective United Nations  so that Member States can better respond to the aspirations and expectations of the international community for a better future. "
"87",3660,"KAZ",61,2006,"First of all  I would like to congratulate you  Madam  on your election to your high office and express confidence that  under your skilful stewardship  the sixty-first session of the General Assembly will be successful and fruitful.  Last year’s World Summit reaffirmed the role of the United Nations as an indispensable and universal forum for taking important action on today’s burning issues. The Summit’s decision to carry out United Nations reform  the most radical in its history  is a case in point. We are now in a position to give a preliminary assessment of the work in that area. The results  unfortunately  are mixed.  On the one hand  helpful decisions have been taken to establish new elective bodies within  the United Nations system — the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. They were set up thanks to the intensive efforts of all delegations  which were able to reach a compromise through negotiations. On the other hand  the lack of any progress on the issue of reforming the work of the General Assembly and the Security Council is seriously impeding the institutional reform of the Organization. In our view  further delays in that process might have a negative impact on the United    06-53323 30  Nations efforts in the areas of international stability  security and development.  For the delegation of Kazakhstan  the current session is  in a way  an anniversary session. We are taking part in the work of this forum for the fifteenth time. While consistently advancing its national interests in the international arena  my country is firmly committed to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.  The establishment in Asia of a mechanism of cooperation to enhance regional security and stability  known as the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA)  was one of Kazakhstan’s first initiatives  put forward from this rostrum in 1992. We can safely claim that the initiative has proved its viability and has become an important factor of international relations at this juncture  as evidenced by the outcome of the second CICA Summit  held in Kazakhstan last June. The documents adopted by CICA  such as the Catalogue of Confidence-building Measures and the Agreement on the Establishment of the CICA Secretariat  have created propitious conditions for regional cooperation and multilateral dialogue in Asia.  Kazakhstan has consistently called for an enhanced nuclear-weapons non-proliferation regime. That position is rooted in the sufferings of our people  who are still reeling from the negative effects of nuclear explosions at the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground  shut down exactly 15 years ago by decree of President Nursultan Nazarbayev. The position was bolstered by the historic decision of my country to voluntarily renounce its nuclear arsenal  which used to be the fourth largest in the world.  We want that step to serve as a commendable example in the light of the ongoing large-scale crisis that has struck the global security system. Regrettably  the lack of any result at the last Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the United Nations Disarmament Commission remains a major challenge for the international community.  It is time to make coordinated efforts to overcome that crisis. The process to that end has already made a good start. The Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia  signed on 8 September in Semipalatinsk  is a demonstration of the political will of five Central Asian States: Kazakhstan  Kyrgyzstan  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The signing of that milestone instrument could become a catalyst for the process of enhancing the NPT. We believe that tangible progress in that area is possible if all Member States comply with their obligations regarding nuclear disarmament and the vertical and horizontal proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Central Asian States are ready to continue consultations with the permanent members of the Security Council on the issue of that Treaty’s entry into force.  In our view  the States concerned should strictly comply with their commitment to a moratorium on nuclear test explosions and work to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. All peaceful nuclear programmes should be carried out in a transparent manner under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  It is a matter of great concern that the crisis has extended not only to strategic  but also to conventional weapons. Regrettably  Member States have so far failed to devise common approaches to the Programme of Action in that area. We have to step up efforts to tighten national export-control mechanisms. I refer first and foremost to dual-use materials and technologies  as well as to missiles and the means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction  with full and strict compliance with the provisions of the Security Council resolution adopted in 2004.  The possibility of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists is a matter of grave concern. To prevent such a scenario  we have to push for the accession of all United Nations Member States to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.  We live in a world where tensions between States and armed conflicts are still very much a part of everyday life. The crisis in Lebanon has highlighted yet again the need to use effectively the United Nations capacity to maintain international peace and security. Since the early days of the conflict  Kazakhstan has called for the strengthening of the Security Council’s role in the settlement of that crisis.  The deployment of a strengthened contingent of United Nations peacekeepers in the conflict zone was the only viable solution to that large-scale crisis. Regrettably  the lack of an effective mechanism to prevent the break-up and spread of armed conflicts   31 06-53323  remains a serious problem. In our view  the establishment of a United Nations preventive diplomacy and conflict prevention centre in Central Asia remains a relevant proposition. That Centre would focus on the provision of advice and expertise to the countries of the region  taking into account their national interests and security considerations.  It is vitally important to identify how the belated adoption of the Security Council resolution on Lebanon is consistent with the process of United Nations reform. The inefficiency of the institutional system of the United Nations and the lack of broad understanding among Member States negatively affect global and regional stability and security.  Kazakhstan has decided to run for a seat on the Economic and Social Council. We express our appreciation to those Member States that have supported our nomination. If elected  we intend actively to participate in the work of that important United Nations organ on all substantive items on its agenda.   Speaking from this high rostrum  I feel obliged to express serious concern about the resurgence of international terrorism. Recent explosions in Iraq and Turkey and the aborted London terror plot indicate that this global threat is clearly growing. It is impossible to counter the threat without consolidated efforts on the part of the entire international community to speed up the implementation of relevant counter-terrorism conventions and Security Council resolutions. We have to strengthen cooperation between Member States at the United Nations. The early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism is very much on our agenda.  With illegal routes for the delivery of Afghan drugs from Asia to Europe running through its territory  Kazakhstan makes every effort to address that threat  yet it is clear that no country in the world can address it effectively on its own. The fight will be effective only if we join our efforts and mobilize the resources of the United Nations and its specialized agencies. It is precisely for that reason that Kazakhstan has supported the United Nations initiative to set up in Kazakhstan a Central Asian regional information and coordination centre to fight illegal drug trafficking.  We welcome the results of the General Assembly’s High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. We believe that those discussions have helped to lay the groundwork for a regular dialogue on that issue among all parties concerned. As a country of destination  transit and origin for migration  Kazakhstan is willing to take an active part in the search for solutions to the problems of illegal migration  labour migration and the protection of the rights of migrants.  In our view  development issues should remain the focus of attention of the international community. The timely and effective achievement of the Millennium Development Goals will grow in importance as we approach 2015. Kazakhstan supports decisions on development issues taken at major international conferences and United Nations summits  and calls for their timely and effective implementation.  As the largest landlocked country  Kazakhstan urges the international community — above all the developed countries — to make every effort to meet the needs of the least developed and developing landlocked countries.  The structural reforms carried out since its independence have totally transformed Kazakhstan. Today  it is one of the most dynamic States of the world and has set ambitious goals to promote further development. The average growth of our gross domestic product over the past five years is 10 per cent. The World Bank has included Kazakhstan in the top 20 most attractive economies for investment. The Government works to ensure that Kazakhstan will join the ranks of the most competitive economies. To reach that target  we have developed an innovative industrial economic development programme and finance relevant projects through a special national fund. All the basic development institutions have been established. Negotiations on Kazakhstan’s admission to the World Trade Organization are in their final stages. Programmes are being implemented to use the transport and transit capacity of the country  and large-scale projects are being carried out to integrate the country’s transportation infrastructure into the Eurasian transportation system.  Kazakhstan renews its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. The United Nations Development Programme report issued on the eve of the 2005 World Summit demonstrates that our country has made great strides in that area.  As a major exporter of energy resources  Kazakhstan will continue to pursue its policy to ensure    06-53323 32  their delivery to world markets through multiple routes. With the growing economy  the Government is consistently increasing social spending  primarily in health care  education  employment and other areas. Our efforts have made it possible for the World Bank to rank Kazakhstan as a successful State with a dynamically growing economy.  We pay close attention to the promotion of democracy  the building of civil society and the enhancement of inter-ethnic and inter-faith accord within the country. Our accomplishments are evident. My country  home to more than 100 ethnic groups and practically all religions  is a model of tolerance  accord and stability.  It is no accident that Kazakhstan has hosted a forum of leaders of world and traditional religions. The second congress has just completed its deliberations in Astana  at which religious leaders adopted a declaration calling for an active dialogue among religions. We cannot allow the use of religious differences as an instrument of hatred and strife  and we have to save humanity from a global clash of religions and cultures. The congress has become Kazakhstan’s contribution to global dialogue among religions.  Kazakhstan carries out a balanced foreign policy based on our long-term national interests and aimed at the development of friendly ties with neighbouring countries and all interested countries of the world.  As the current Chair of the Commonwealth of Independent States  my country has devised a plan to reform that organization in order to enhance its capacity. Kazakhstan has been working actively in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian Economic Community and supports the Collective Security Treaty Organization.  Ahead of the other post-Soviet countries in many areas  Kazakhstan has always assumed responsibility for the implementation of international initiatives  whether it be the decision to shut down the Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground  or to voluntarily renounce nuclear weapons  or its initiatives to convene a regional security forum in Asia  or to hold a congress of leaders of world and traditional religions or to host the first global conference on transit-transport cooperation or to host a special meeting of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee. In 2007  Kazakhstan will host the sixty-third session of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.  We express our appreciation to all States that have supported Kazakhstan’s candidature for the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2009. Kazakhstan will continue to be active on all key items of the global agenda.  In conclusion  I would like to quote a popular saying in my country: “Nothing can be farther than yesterday and nothing can be closer than tomorrow”. A year ago  at the World Summit  we agreed to take action to reform the United Nations. We should not forget that humanity pins its hopes for a better future on the United Nations as an indispensable Organization. It is high time to take specific and effective action to raise the prestige of our Organization. "
"88",3707,"KEN",61,2006,"Let me add my voice of congratulations to President Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her assumption of this driving seat  which has mainly been occupied by men in the history of the United Nations. Before this Assembly last week  we welcomed the first African woman to become a national President — Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia. At last  the glass ceiling that has tended to frustrate the attempts of women to become presidents is surely cracking in several places. We should celebrate that.  Let me also congratulate Ambassador Jan Eliasson of Sweden for a job well done as President of this Assembly.  Kenya is a United Nations country. We attach special significance to our being hosts of the biggest United Nations centre outside the developed world — the United Nations Office at Nairobi  which also hosts the global headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. We are a major    06-53615 14  contributor to United Nations peace missions around the world. We subscribe to the principles and ideals of this Organization and have always upheld its Charter.  In my contribution to this general debate  allow me to dwell on the crisis that is Somalia. I do not think that I need to remind the world that there is a crisis in Somalia  but I believe that I must encourage the community of nations to understand that the problem of Somalia is not going to go away unless we take deliberate steps to address the crisis. The comfortable thing to do is to look at Somalia as being far away and hope that the problem will resolve itself somehow.  This afternoon  I bring the bad news that the problem of Somalia is not going to get resolved somehow by itself. All of us  the community of nations  must chip in. If  for a moment  we dwell on the comforting notion that Somali does not concern us  then it may be worth talking to my friends from South Korea or China  which are 8 000 to 10 000 kilometres away from Somalia. A few months ago  pirates from Somalia hijacked merchant ships in international waters off the coast of Somalia. It was only after protracted negotiations that included use of Kenyan intelligence that the merchant seamen from South Korea and China were released safely to their families.  I recount this story of merchant seamen so that all of us in the international community should appreciate that the Somali phenomenon  with no Government in place  is a danger not just to neighbouring countries  but to the whole world. As criminal elements establish their safe enclaves in a country like Somalia  the neighbouring countries and the international community are soon forced to intervene  even militarily  to free hostages  to hunt terrorists or to flush out rebels.  In the new global village  we are all neighbours of Somalia. As a front-line State to that country in crisis  we have participated in negotiations to free hostages. We have cooperated in attempts to arrest criminal elements. We continue to host close to a million refugees. We provide life-saving support in terms of medical facilities and supplies. But above all  we continue to work on efforts to create peace in Somalia. The Transitional Federal Government  the Transitional Charter and the Transitional Federal Parliament were established all as a result of a process that took place in Nairobi when we hosted up to 2 000 representatives from a cross-section of Somalia over a period of two years.  Today  I appeal to the rest of the world to take deliberate steps to help Somalia. The time to help is now. Tomorrow may be too late.  There are many communities around the world that attach great importance to funerals. In those communities  most people only stand by and watch when their kin have fallen ill. An occasional visit and some token of support are what obtains. As soon as the patient dies  an avalanche of support flows in. The community of nations must not take that cynical or undertaker’s approach. We are already too late  and any intervention we implement now is of an ambulance-and-fire-brigade variety  at best  but it is better than simply standing by like spectators.  Somalia is almost dying. We can see it. We have known that for the past 16 years. This is the time to send in life-saving support. It is really a tribute to the resilience of the Somali people that there are still living human beings in that country. One day or one month without Government  police  hospitals or banks in modern society is unimaginable. The Somalis have endured for 16 years. How much longer are they expected to endure? Where is the international rescue plan with a billion dollars? Where is the Marshall Plan for Somalia?  Even a much better but devastated Japan and Germany needed a Marshall Plan after the Second World War. We in our region are sure that humanitarian intervention now will yield better and faster results than military intervention and at a much cheaper price than sending troops to pursue criminal elements in a failed State. That is not rocket science or complex economic theory. That is common sense. All we need is the will and the focus to apply ourselves collectively to the problem of Somalia. I appreciate how difficult it is to be focused  given the several competing issues around the world  but focused we must be if we are to avoid the current flip-flopping from one crisis to another like chickens with their heads cut off.   I hear talk today about religious extremists in Somalia. What did we expect? Our own seven-year-old children become extremists in our households if they go without food for one day. Somali children  youth  women and men have been going hungry for 16 years and living under very difficult circumstances. To be extremist is the normal human reaction in such   15 06-53615  circumstances and one does not have to have studied psychiatry at the PhD level to recognize that. If similar circumstances in Somalia prevailed in other countries  we all know that moderation would be the exception.  Yesterday  I had the opportunity to brief the Security Council on the position of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on Somalia. Our IGAD position is to support the Transitional Federal Government  together with such legitimate transitional federal institutions as the Parliament in Baidoa and the Transitional Charter that is the broadly negotiated road map for Somalia.  As IGAD  we have also opened a window of dialogue with the Islamic Courts Union (ICU). Some four weeks ago  I met representatives of the ICU in Nairobi. We believe that  as in all situations of conflict  the final resolution is best achieved through dialogue. That is why  in our communiqué issued in Nairobi  we welcomed the Khartoum talks that brought together the Transitional Federal Government and the ICU. But we are also concerned that communiqués after these dialogue conferences should be genuine. Soon after the Khartoum meeting  the news from Somalia has not been encouraging. There was an assassination attempt on the life of President Yusuf. One more city was overtaken by the ICU  not to mention the cold-blooded murder of a long-serving humanitarian worker  a dedicated Catholic nun. The upbeat communiqué released from Khartoum begins to look like a sandwich without meat  fed to a world that is starved of any encouraging news from Somalia.  There is a critical path that was set up by IGAD with the help of the international community and that resulted in the formation of the Somali Transitional Charter that is recognized by the African Union and the United Nations. We are encouraged by the United Nations positive endorsement of the Transitional Charter  which includes the Transitional Federal Government and the Transitional Federal Parliament. Indeed  the Transitional Federal Government is fully accredited to the United Nations  the African Union and IGAD  and the presidency of the Security Council has articulated that recognition through its various communications  including the presidential statement of 13 July.   However  there is a major obstacle faced by the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia. Without substantive international support beyond the recognitions  accreditations  resolutions and statements I have alluded to  the bottom line remains that the Transitional Federal Government is like people thrown into the deep end of turbulent waters and are expected to swim with their hands tied behind their backs while hungry crocodiles surround them. It is not a very encouraging scenario. That is why we appeal for more meaningful support for the Transitional Federal Government  even as we insist that it continue to dialogue with various groupings in Somalia.  The international community must work to help Somalia and not inadvertently compound the problem in that country. It is vital that the international community consolidate its efforts and not send discordant messages from Stockholm  New York  Nairobi  Khartoum  Cairo  Addis Ababa or anywhere else. Whatever the motives behind the proliferation of initiatives from different capitals  we must recognize that discordant signals act only to give incentive to some of the actors on the ground to attempt to establish new facts on the ground that they may leverage in future negotiations.  I discussed that matter with the Secretary-General of the Arab League this morning and yesterday. Kenya has put forward the following proposal  which I would like to share with the General Assembly. We propose that an international joint committee on Somalia be constituted with the following membership: IGAD  representing the front-line States; the African Union; the Arab League  also representing the front-line States; the European Union; and the United Nations  with at least one or two permanent members of the Security Council to be included. It is our submission that the international joint commission will help consolidate our efforts and bring about a speedier resolution of the problem.   It is worth noting that the initiative that resulted in the formation of the current Transitional Federal Government was the fourteenth attempt to resolve the Somali conflict after 14 years. Its collapse would bring us back to square one in terms of coming up with an institutional framework that enjoys political legitimacy. The Secretary-General of the Arab League has expressed his support for the Kenyan proposal and we hope that we can proceed on that path by building on the foundations already established by IGAD  rather than allow another proliferation of vertical initiatives. We appeal to other partners to embrace the proposal.    06-53615 16   On a more hopeful note  let me register our delight at the progress made by our neighbours Tanzania  Uganda and South Africa in brokering the Burundi peace agreement. We commend their collective effort. The news from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also encouraging.  As Kenya takes over the chairmanship of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region  which will convene in December this year  let me assure the Assembly that we will do our best to contribute to the stabilization of our region  which is really a very tough neighbourhood to live in.  Finally  let me congratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his exemplary stewardship of this world body. As a brother from Africa  I can confidently say that he has done us proud. "
"89",3731,"KGZ",61,2006,"For more than a year now  Kyrgyzstan has been experiencing a new stage in its historical development. Today  our leaders are doing their utmost to further strengthen our country’s democratic and market reforms. The unswerving policy we have adopted in order to build a democratic society based on laws and a well-developed national economy will lay a solid foundation for a stable political situation. We have committed ourselves to ensuring all the conditions necessary for the sustainable development of Kyrgyzstan’s economy and the enhancement of our people’s well-being.  At the 2005 World Summit  the President of the Kyrgyz Republic  Mr. Kurmanbek Bakiev  reaffirmed our full commitment to the universal goals and targets set out in the Millennium Declaration. All the necessary legislative measures have been adopted in our country to protect social well-being and to support the most vulnerable sectors of the population. That will help significantly to reduce our poverty level.  In 2005 alone  despite the existing difficulties  social expenditures constituted more than 43 per cent   39 06-53323  of the Republic’s budget. As a result  as stated in the report of the Secretary-General on the integration of countries with economies in transition into the world economy  Kyrgyzstan has reduced the scale of poverty in the country.  I would also like to point out that the situation today in the Kyrgyz Republic is characterized by openness in the economy  macro-economic stability  a liberal currency and visa regime  and the free movement of capital and labour. We also enjoy the advantages of membership in the World Trade Organization.  As I have already pointed out  my country has repeatedly and actively shown its commitment to its international obligations in the area of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. Today  the Kyrgyz Republic adheres to all the basic universal international instruments with a human dimension and continues to carry out those provisions responsibly. Further democratization of the society and the encouragement of human rights remain the priorities for our domestic policy. This is why our Head of State has initiated reform in law enforcement and judicial bodies  as well as constitutional reform in order to improve the balance of power. I would like to point out  in particular  that a very active role is being played by political parties and civil society in this process  thereby ensuring the genuine involvement of broad masses of the population in the adoption of important State decisions.  A month ago  the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights decided to establish a Regional Office in Bishkek  the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic. We regard this move as indicating a strong recognition of our efforts towards strengthening democratic principles and encouraging human rights and freedom of speech in the country.  The Kyrgyz Republic has ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption and has devised a State strategy to combat this scourge. It has established a national agency to combat corruption and a financial intelligence service. I am certain that in our country  where effective governance is being practiced and where human rights are being observed  there will be a better chance of avoiding conflict and overcoming obstacles to development. It is no secret that  at this difficult time in human development  with its increasing global  regional and civilizational problems  we all feel the presence of moral and psychological malaise in many parts of the world.  In order to attain harmony on our planet  all of us need to humanize our societies and give pride of place to moral and spiritual values. As our forebears have said  when people unite in spirit  they can move mountains. Today  we are all witnessing global change. There are new issues  new tasks that require innovative approaches to solve them. In this regard  the Kyrgyz Republic proposes the formulation of yet another Millennium Goal — goal 9 — which should focus on dynamic development of the local community. Success could be guaranteed through improving the system of governance  democratization of local self-governance  the elimination of corruption and the involvement in governance of representatives of various social and ethnic groups. We base this on the principle that a strong local community means a stable State. A stable State means a stable region. And a stable region means a secure world.  It is well known that security and development are indivisible. We cannot ensure development  if we do not ensure security. We will not achieve global security unless we support development and eliminate poverty. As the Millennium Project report has pointed out  there are many factors underlying extreme poverty  first and foremost being that of an unfavourable geographical situation.  In this connection  I would like to devote special attention to mountainous areas  which are our planet’s basic source of drinking water. We are grateful for the support of the United Nations Member States in adopting General Assembly resolution 60/198 on sustainable mountain development at the Assembly’s sixtieth session. I am certain that this will enable mountain countries to take serious steps towards solving social  economic and environmental problems.  Pursuant to the decisions of the Bishkek Mountain Platform  which was adopted in 2002 at the Bishkek Global Mountain Summit  we propose that a second mountain summit be convened in 2007  with a view to taking stock of the international community’s activities relating to sustainable mountain development over the past five years. This initiative has already received support from the United Nations Development Programme Administrator  Kemal Dervish  and the Director-General of UNESCO  Mr. Koïchiro Matsuura  who proposed that we call the second summit “Bishkek    06-53323 40  Plus Five”. I would like to take this opportunity to invite all States to take part in this important international forum. We hope the international community will support our initiative.  Commitment to a policy of disarmament and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction is one of the major fundamental principles of the foreign policy of the peace-loving Kyrgyz Republic. Proof of this policy was the signing on 8 September 2006 in Kazakhstan of an agreement on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. We regard this as a joint contribution of the States of the region to global security and to freeing humankind from the threat of lethal weapons. At present  non-nuclear zones are becoming an important element in multilateral mechanisms to counter nuclear terrorism. The issue is more timely than ever  bearing in mind the existing threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorist organizations.  In this connection  from this lofty rostrum of the Assembly Hall  I would like to appeal to United Nations Member States to support the draft resolution on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia  which will be put forward at the current session of the Assembly’s First Committee. One of the distinguishing features of our nuclear-free zone is its environmental aspect. States in the region have suffered more than most from the negative impact of nuclear programmes and testing. Human radiation  radiation of our territory and the dangers posed by uranium tailings are proof of this.  Existing regional environmental problems are being worsened by global warming  drought and soil degradation. This year the Kyrgyz Republic chairs the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea. The problem of the Aral Sea has today taken on the scope of a global environmental disaster that  to various extents  has influenced natural processes throughout the world. In this connection  we call upon the international community to consolidate efforts for the implementation of programmes and projects to save the Aral Sea.  I would like to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his comprehensive report on the work of the Organization (document A/61/1). With his usual leadership skills  he has clearly set forth in the report the activities of the Organization during 2005. We fully share his view that globalization has become one of the predominant factors of the last decade. We must see to it that the United Nations strengthens its positive aspects. With the active participation of our Organization  globalization must become an instrument to ensure sustainable development and reduce the gap between rich and poor  overcome discrimination in economic relations and enhance the well-being of our peoples.  Unfortunately  along with globalization there has been an increase in the spread of such threats and challenges as international crime  the illicit trade in drugs and weapons  epidemic disease and environmental degradation. The Government of Kyrgyzstan has been taking decisive steps to combat these negative phenomena. They are especially felt in our region  bearing in mind the difficult situation in Afghanistan.  I am convinced that effectively countering these threats is possible only on the basis of a worldwide expansion of regional and international cooperation  involving organizations that have the necessary capacities and that are successfully operating to that end at the present time. In this respect  the Kyrgyz Republic is taking an active part in the work of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Today  as President of SCO  Kyrgyzstan will do its utmost to strengthen it further as a reliable guarantor of security and stability in the region.  Speaking last year from this high rostrum  President Kurmanbek Bakiev of the Kyrgyz Republic stated that the sixtieth session of the General Assembly must be remembered as one of reform. Today  we can assert that the 60th anniversary session was indeed one of reform. We established the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council and created the Central Emergency Response Fund. We reformed the Secretariat and adopted a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  And yet  a number of key tasks remain to be carried out. The Kyrgyz Republic agrees that there is a need to step up the activities of the General Assembly and to strengthen the role of the Economic and Social Council in attaining critical development goals.   United Nations reform will not be complete without Security Council reform. We advocate enhanced efforts to seek solutions in the interests of all members of the international community. Kyrgyzstan   41 06-53323  joins in the appeal of Member States to expand permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council  which would reflect the realities of our times and promote the effectiveness of our work.  We believe that if the United Nations activities are to be consistent and effective  we must keep up with the times and adapt to events as they take place in the course of human development. The United Nations must be oriented towards achieving concrete results and meeting the pressing needs of the peoples of our planet. "
"90",3774,"KHM",61,2006,"At the outset  on behalf of the Cambodian delegation  let me extend our heartfelt congratulations to you  Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain  on your election to the presidency of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. Your election to that important post is a testament to Your Excellency’s distinctive abilities and impressive achievements over the years. I am convinced that under your direction  this year’s session will achieve a successful outcome.  Please allow me also to pay tribute to the vision and tireless efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan in promoting global peace and in taking the necessary steps to encourage many initiatives for the reform of the United Nations. Our appreciation is also addressed to His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson for his efficient leadership as President of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly  as well as for his countless contributions to United Nations reform initiatives.  In the face of uncertainties and challenges  where the world seems to be inundated with conflicts and serious threats — such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)  terrorism  environmental degradation and infectious diseases — it is important for all of us to keep our commitment to maintain peace and security in the world. In addition  I believe that the reduction of global poverty and the achievement of sustainable development in many developing countries are vital for human security. At the same time  they are a daunting task for the United Nations as a catalyst of the international community in helping to improve the situation of those countries.  Concerning the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  Cambodia is of the view that the international community needs to be more vigilant about the issue and to ensure that WMDs or their components do not fall into the wrong hands — those of terrorists  organized crime groups or others — which could have dangerous implications for international peace and security. In that regard  we need to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime in order to secure a better and more peaceful world for all. Nor should small arms and light weapons be underestimated  as they are an equally dangerous source of conflict  transnational crime and violence in many regions and countries.  The fight against terrorism remains of utmost priority for all Governments and for the United Nations  given the continuing threat posed by terrorism despite the serious measures and actions that have been taken by Governments and international and regional organizations at various levels  including this world body. To combat terrorism effectively requires  I believe  more efforts  more technical capacity  more education  more information-sharing among law enforcement authorities and intelligence communities and maybe more understanding in some specific cases of the root causes of acts of violence which are tantamount to reactions of despair.  Concerning the Middle East crisis  we have to congratulate the Security Council on the adoption of its resolution 1701 (2006) to end the recent war in Lebanon. We call upon all parties concerned to fully respect that resolution in order to prevent a repetition of the conflict and further loss of innocent life. In the same vein  the international community should work more actively to help bring about a permanent end to the violence between Palestine and Israel. I believe that peace in the Middle East will be better guaranteed only when the leaders of both sides — Palestine and Israel — have the courage and wisdom to realize that they cannot continue to destroy each other forever  but must work together for a lasting peace in the region.   Both Israel and Palestine have the right to coexist as independent and sovereign States. At the same time  they need to overcome their historical animosity and hatred towards each other. Whether they like it or not  Israel and Palestine are destined to coexist as neighbours forever. I strongly believe that a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would create the foundation for durable peace and security in the entire Middle East.   With regard to United Nations reform  it is clear that in recent years  every State member of the world body has wanted the United Nations to be reformed. However  when the opportunity arises  we face a deadlock on this very important issue  because too much emphasis has been placed on reform of the Security Council. In that regard  I think that we should learn this lesson and try to avoid repeating such mistakes in the future. In other words  we should take a step-by-step approach and tackle minor problems first     06-53329 4  such as strengthening the role of the Economic and Social Council to deal with development  since that issue is less controversial and there is more inclination to support it.   Next  we might consider revitalizing the General Assembly as the sole body representative of all United Nations Member States. Afterward  we can move forward to the reform of the Security Council. We have to start first with issues where consensus could be easily reached  and then move to the more difficult ones  without having to completely stall the United Nations reform process.  Since their adoption in 2000  by and large there has been progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). But in actuality there has been little achievement for developing countries thus far due to a number of factors  such as lack of financial and human resources  including the negative impact of globalization  which has led to a widening gap between developed countries and poor nations.  In Cambodia  the Royal Government has set up its own “MDGs”  called the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals  with specific target priorities. Since their establishment  Cambodia has made positive progress in some areas  such as reducing poverty  combating HIV/AIDS and improving the livelihood of our people  thanks to the rectangular strategy of the Royal Government  which yielded strong economic growth over the past year.  Extreme poverty in the world today is an affront to the whole world with 1.3 billion people still living on the margins of life  earning less than one dollar a day  while another 1.8 billion are living on less than two dollars a day  in spite of the commitment to the MDGs in 2000. Addressing this crucial problem requires painstaking efforts at the national and international levels. The eradication of poverty is  first and foremost  the responsibility of the whole world and requires the cooperation of the developed countries and international organizations. Given the enormous resources and wealth of this world  I believe that no one on this planet should go hungry while in developed countries there is an over-supply of food  which has led to wasteful dumping.  To deal with global poverty  a comprehensive approach and collective actions are needed. Official development assistance  debt relief  market access  transfer of know-how  foreign direct investment and so forth must be addressed all together  so that developing countries can catch up with the current globalization in order to bridge the gap between peoples and nations in this world where we all are living.  Finally  let me reiterate that our world today will continue to face major global threats and challenges. The role of the United Nations  as an Organization that is representative of the whole world  in tackling these phenomena is of paramount importance for humankind. Therefore  Cambodia hopes that United Nations reform can move ahead to significantly contribute to dealing with these challenges successfully. "
"91",3788,"KIR",61,2006,"I bring to you all warm greetings from the President  Government and people of the Republic of Kiribati  on whose behalf I am honoured and privileged to address this Assembly this evening.  Allow me  Sir  to offer my heartiest congratulations to Ms. Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am confident that under her able stewardship this session will successfully deliver constructive and productive outcomes that will benefit the membership. I wish also to offer my congratulations to her predecessor for his successful guidance of the work of the Assembly during the past year.  May I also express to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  my warmest congratulations on his sterling leadership of the Organization during his tenure in office. We are grateful for the excellent work he has done in navigating the Organization through the challenges of the past decade. We wish him well in his future endeavours.  We continue to be confronted with major challenges. Those challenges affect each of us as individual countries and as members of the international community. Peace and security remain elusive in this world of ours  given the ongoing conflicts and the threat of new conflicts around the world. Terrorism continues to plague us  despite the best concerted and collective efforts. Still more needs to be done to remove the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And while some progress has been made towards addressing the threat posed by the continuing illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  further work is needed to eliminate that threat.  For the least developed countries and the small island developing States  the challenges of economic development remain at the forefront of our agendas. Marginalization in the global economy is a feature common to many least developed countries and small island developing States. The record high price of oil has done little to ease the burden on our small economies.  In Kiribati  our remoteness and insularity  narrow economic base  small population size and high population growth rates are factors with which we must contend. We must also deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic and tuberculosis  among other diseases     06-52737 50  which require the diversion of the already meagre resources at our disposal to finance development.  With those daunting challenges looming  we are forced to operate in an environment of uncertainty. I say “uncertainty”  because our very survival as a nation and as a people with a distinct culture and way of life is being threatened by global warming and sea-level rise.  These are challenges that we  as individual countries and as Members of this collective body  need to continue to work together to address. In this increasingly interdependent world of ours  ripples emanating from one part will ultimately reach out to touch the shores of others.  Kiribati consists of low-lying coral atolls and is particularly vulnerable to the impact of global warming and sea-level rise. For countries such as ours  global warming and sea-level rise are critical security issues. While we welcome the support that has been forthcoming in developing adaptation strategies to these phenomena  there is a limit to the extent to which we can adapt. Rising sea levels will affect our groundwater supply and gradually erode whatever land is available on our 33 islands. Yes  we could always move inland to avoid the rising sea levels. But  given the narrowness of our islands  if we move inland too far  we risk falling into either the lagoon or the ocean.  We will continue to call on the international community to agree on a unified global response to these phenomena. We will continue to work with like-minded countries in pushing the case for such a response. We have been disappointed at the lack of consensus on these critical environmental issues. Indeed  we deplore the notion that economic growth should take precedence over environmental issues when the quest for such growth threatens the very survival of some Members of the Organization.  Kiribati is a strong supporter of environmental conservation efforts. In that regard  we have announced the establishment of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area  which is recognized as the third largest marine protected area in the world. We are pleased to have been able to contribute to global environmental conservation efforts through the Protected Area. We are prepared to work with those willing and able to ensure its sustainability.  We note the progress that has been made with regard to reforming the United Nations. Understandably  we would have liked to see greater progress made by now  but we fully recognize the need for more discussions on the various relevant issues.  Indeed  that is multilateralism in practice. The debate on unilateralism versus multilateralism in world affairs continues unabated. We see multilateralism in full play in the debate on United Nations reform. We consider that to be a reflection of the healthy interest that each Member country has in the Organization. Indeed  in this day and age  multilateralism would seem to be a more appropriate approach than unilateralism.  Consensus has yet to be reached on reform of the Security Council. We note with interest the report of the Working Group. While acknowledging the very strong interest in the issues raised and the need to forge a consensus  we believe that perhaps there is also a need to consider how much more time will be required to move this forward.  Our position on the issue remains unchanged: those Member States that are major contributors to United Nations programmes — especially with regard to the maintenance of global peace and security — should be accorded permanent membership of the Security Council. In our view  Japan  as such a Member State  qualifies for permanent membership.  Regional cooperation in the Pacific has been effective. In the recent past  we have had a number of examples of success in regional cooperative efforts. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands has made substantial contributions to securing peace and law and order in that country. Kiribati is pleased to have been able to contribute civilian police personnel to the Mission. We will continue to support its work as long as the people and the Government of the Solomon Islands wish it to continue.  The Pacific Regional Assistance to Nauru programme has made positive contributions to Nauru. In view of the historical ties between our two countries  we have worked closely with Nauru on a bilateral basis and remain committed to considering other options through which we can extend our collaboration.   51 06-52737   Our leaders will be meeting next month to discuss  among other things  progress on the Pacific Plan. We are satisfied with the initial progress. The success or lack thereof of the Pacific Plan will depend on a number of factors  including the political commitment of each member country to the Plan and the Plan’s ability to deliver tangible benefits over and above what is available  on a bilateral basis  to its membership.  We extend a warm welcome to the Republic of Montenegro  which joined the Organization as a Member this year. Montenegro’s membership brings to 192 the total United Nations membership. The continuing desire on the part of many to join the Organization attests to the value and continued relevance of the United Nations.  Therefore  I note with much disappointment and regret that the desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to join this Organization of ours continues to be rejected  despite Taiwan’s demonstrated ability  willingness and commitment to contribute to international collaborative efforts in the pursuit of global peace and security. In recent years  there has been much talk of good governance  of democratizing   nations. Should we not also talk about adopting a policy of good governance in our multilateral organizations? Should we also not talk about democratizing our multilateral organizations? We deplore the sad state of affairs in which a nation of 23 million people is deliberately exempt from participation as an equal member of the international community.  The President of the General Assembly has our full support as she carries out the duties of her office. We commit ourselves to working closely with her as we collectively seek to address the challenges facing us.  Allow me to close by conveying to all members of the General Assembly our traditional blessing: to mauri  to raoi ao to tabomoa — health  peace and prosperity. "
"92",3819,"KNA",61,2006,"Allow me  Madam President  to make a few preliminary remarks. First  Saint Kitts and Nevis extends sincere congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. My delegation is confident that you will rise to the occasion  and in so doing  make not just the Kingdom of Bahrain  but the United Nations family proud of you. Secondly  I wish to laud the leadership of His Excellency Jan Eliasson during the course of the sixtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly. His leadership was propitious and outstanding at a time of reform and intense challenges for the United Nations.   Thirdly  it would be remiss of me if I did not salute the quintessential diplomat in the personality of His Excellency Kofi Annan who  for nigh on 10 years  skilfully steered the United Nations ship through many rough and difficult waters. We are indebted to him for his supreme statesman-like leadership. I hail him as a brother of the diaspora and a gem of human civilization.   Fourthly  Saint Kitts and Nevis warmly welcomes the Republic of Montenegro into the United Nations family. It has taken a bold step in order to play an active role in the international discourse and we applaud it for that initiative.  This year’s theme “Implementing a Global Partnership for Development” coincides with my country’s focus on linking the need for human rights with the desire for a comprehensive and sustainable human development strategy. For too long  the issues of human rights and human development have not always run in parallel. My delegation believes that oversight needs to be corrected.   Over the years  the international community has focused its attention either on human rights violations  or on human development. What has transpired at times is  unfortunately  a withdrawal of resources from one programme to supplement the other  which then has an adverse effect on the former. What I suggest today is that there should be a strategy of linking human rights and human development so as to ensure that our peoples are cared for in a holistic manner.  Many of us may recall that during the previous session of the General Assembly  when the Human Rights Council was being established  there was a call for the right to development to be included within the broader theme of human rights. My delegation believes that is  in principle  still necessary. At the same time  we also believe that development in all of its forms will not have any long-term effects or benefits unless human rights are incorporated in that development.  We propose  therefore  that during the sixty-first session the Assembly ensure that the drive for a global partnership for development is pursued with the goal of ensuring that human rights and human development run in tandem and  in effect  complement each other. My delegation believes that only through that approach can true global partnerships for development occur.  Those ideals can be achieved. Saint Kitts and Nevis has witnessed the possibility first-hand. Within the Caribbean Community  we have embarked upon a regional partnership for development and in that development we have ensured that the rights of our citizens and the development of our people are at the forefront of our regional partnership. A few months ago  we formally established the CARICOM Single Market and Economy. That was an initiative years in the making; CARICOM member States remained cognizant of all the effects that the initiative would have on its people  and we attempted  of course  to address them all.  We acknowledged that there would be growing pains but we also realized that  for our nationals to truly benefit in this rapidly globalizing world  it was necessary. However  my CARICOM colleagues and I have sought to minimize any short-term negative effects.  For a country like mine  which only recently made the painful decision to close our 360-year-old sugar industry  the partnerships we have nurtured within CARICOM have helped to ease the pain and helped to prepare us for the Single Market. What we need on a global scale is: partnerships for development that consider and ensure human rights and human development for every State.  Whatever way is deemed most appropriate  partnerships should begin with mutual respect and a commitment to understanding each other. We live in a diverse world  and  owing to globalization  that diversity is felt now more than ever before. If we do not strive to respect and understand each other  tensions will mount and instability will reign.   5 06-53952   That is why Saint Kitts and Nevis has stood at this rostrum time and time again  and called for the human rights of the people of the Republic of China — Taiwan — to be acknowledged in this body. The Republic of China is a democratic country that has continued to embody the principles of the United Nations. That country has continued to ensure that human rights and human development are nurtured and preserved together  and has many contributions to make in the pursuit of a global partnership for development. It has been a great and magnificent friend to several States members of the United Nations family  and not just those with which it has diplomatic ties. We  as the pre-eminent international body  owe the Republic of China and its 23 million people our support and acceptance  and we owe ourselves the benefit of having the Republic of China fully participating in the United Nations system.  My delegation would like to single out and applaud the peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of Haiti for striving to overcome periods of instability and uncertainty through the democratic process. For the Democratic Republic of the Congo  more than two generations have passed between democratic elections. And Haiti’s 200-year history has been tumultuous in terms of its approach to democratic life. The Caribbean Community was especially pleased with the important democratic step taken by the Republic of Haiti  and we were able this year to welcome Haiti back into our fold.  Those landmark elections could not have occurred without a concerted effort by all concerned to undertake partnerships  while respecting each other and striving for full and comprehensive human rights and human development  along with a desire for peace. This is a fragile period for those countries  but my delegation lauds their efforts and initiatives  and we stand firm in our commitment to join in the global partnership for the development of those two countries.  One year ago  the heads of State or Government of the majority of the States Members of the United Nations signed on to the World Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). The document was viewed as the catalyst for a renewed commitment to a global partnership for development  security and human rights. During the sixtieth session  that commitment was further solidified with the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council. Dialogue continued on issues relating to the reform of the United Nations. However  more commitment and partnership are needed to see these reforms come to fruition.  We must make a concerted effort. I cannot stress that enough. If we were to be honest with ourselves  we would acknowledge that the principles of the United Nations have not been at the forefront of our negotiations and that human rights and human development have not been universally preserved. I have already alluded to our diversity  but that must not continue to produce adversity. Rather  it should produce a more holistic reform agenda.  Saint Kitts and Nevis remains committed to action on the reform of the United Nations. The reform of the United Nations must be transparent. Three of the more contentious areas of the reform of the United Nations have revolved around the issue of transparency. I speak of the reform of the Security Council and of the General Assembly  and the process of selecting the Secretary-General.  The United Nations has evolved. We all have to come to terms with that fact. The body that existed 61 years ago could not operate in the world of today. Full representation is necessary  and transparency is a must. This  in our view  is tantamount to a successful global partnership.  For this session of the General Assembly  Saint Kitts and Nevis proposes a renewed emphasis on human rights and human development. We have actually begun that process in a very promising way with the recently concluded High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. In that regard  we agree that it is imperative that the human rights and human development of migrants be taken into serious consideration to ensure greater production and development in the countries involved.  Recently  States members of the group of least developed countries (LDCs) held a review of the Brussels Programme of Action. My delegation supports the initiative of the LDCs and stresses that human rights and development must remain core principles in the partnerships of LDCs with other members of the international community.  For my own country of Saint Kitts and Nevis  we ask that the international community also remain committed to the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the    06-53952 6  Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.   Realizing sustainable development presents a formidable challenge for small island developing States. They remain vulnerable to natural disasters  to climate change and to the effects of globalization and trade liberalization. We still need to examine the issue of graduation closely and at our own pace. Our cultural products still remain susceptible to piracy and our opportunities for reaping the benefits of science and technology are still limited. Developing countries are still locked out of the decision-making processes of the global financial institutions  whose policies often undermine and — yes — circumscribe development. In our view  true global partnership should translate into consideration of the requirements of every Member State  whether big or small  and of the issues critical to them.  During the sixty-first session  though there will not be a high-level conference on HIV/AIDS  pandemics such as HIV/AIDS continue to strike at the heart of development by crippling a nation’s most important asset  namely  its people. Without meaningful development  women  children  the elderly and the disabled will remain at-risk sectors of our societies. Financing for development will still be a major concern for all developing countries  and international peace and security will continue to affect us all.  Throughout most of this year  the majority of the United Nations membership experienced the adverse impact of the energy crisis on growth and livelihoods. The United Nations family  which comprises producers and consumers of oil and energy products  must collectively address a global energy security pact incorporating best practices on energy conservation and energy sources.  Finally  development is a matter of extreme importance for all of us. What we need  therefore  is a holistic approach to our global partnership. All of our critical concerns need to be addressed. However  we should begin with a careful consideration of human rights and human development. "
"93",3845,"KOR",61,2006,"Let me begin by congratulating the presidency on the success of the High-level Meeting on the least developed countries  earlier in the week. I had the honour of participating in the Meeting  which heralded a very productive year for the Assembly under the astute leadership of Her Excellency Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  President of the General Assembly  and her Bureau.  I would like to express my deepest thanks and admiration to His Excellency Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his unparalleled dedication and contribution to world peace and prosperity through his dedicated service to our global Organization.  The United Nations was created  first and foremost  to forestall another world war. Not only has it achieved that cardinal goal despite four decades of cold war  but it has also offered States multiple means of resolving their differences  short of war. However  we cannot be sanguine about future trends. If the primary task of the United Nations in the twentieth century was to curb inter-State conflict  its core mandate in the new century must be to strengthen States and to preserve the inter-State system in the face of new challenges.  Some assert that the United Nations is poorly equipped to deal with new threats  such as those posed by non-State actors seeking to undermine the international order. The Charter was crafted to give Member States ample flexibility in adapting the United Nations machinery to respond to novel threats in a changing world. But our tools need sharpening.  Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001  the United Nations has played an increasingly   25 06-53005  indispensable role in the international community’s counter-terrorism efforts. Still  agreement on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism remains elusive. But we must continue to try. In the meantime  the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  adopted at the end of the sixtieth session of the Assembly  will guide our collective efforts to free the world from the scourge of terrorism.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses an equally urgent and unacceptable threat to the peace and security of the world. We cannot permit the credibility of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime  built around the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  to be undermined by evasion and concealment concerning safeguards obligations. We should redouble our efforts to get more countries to sign and ratify International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) additional protocols. An early start of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty and an early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) should also be supported.  Meanwhile  we must seek peaceful solutions to the outstanding challenges to the system  including the Iranian nuclear issue that is before the Security Council. It is not too late to work towards a negotiated solution on that issue with its far-reaching implications. I would call for creative  constructive thinking on the part of all parties concerned  so as to resolve the issue within the framework of the NPT regime.  As for the situation on the Korean peninsula  the nuclear and missile programmes of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea constitute a serious challenge to the non-proliferation regime  as well as to regional security. My Government fully supports Security Council resolution 1695 (2006). We urge the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to refrain from any action that might aggravate the situation  and to return to the Six-Party Talks without preconditions  for a diplomatic resolution of the matter.  In that regard  during the summit meeting held last week in Washington  D.C.  President Roh Moo-hyun and President Bush agreed to work with other nations of the Six-Party Talks to develop a common and comprehensive approach to energize the stalled talks. I strongly hope that those efforts will bear fruit and that we can work to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as envisaged in the Joint Statement adopted on 19 September 2005.  Although not mentioned in the Charter  peacekeeping has become a defining feature of the post-cold-war era  as well as the largest  most expensive and most visible operational activity of the United Nations. The surge in calls for the services of the Blue Helmets attests to the Organization’s continuing  even growing  relevance.  The expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon is a challenging case in point. To succeed  UNIFIL must have the active support of all Member States  backed by timely humanitarian and economic assistance. To that end  my Government has been providing substantial humanitarian assistance to the afflicted population.  The undiminished human suffering in Palestine remains another source of deep concern. We urge the early revival of the stalled peace process.  The violence and the loss of innocent lives in Iraq concern us enormously as well. We trust that Iraq will become a stable and prosperous democracy under the leadership of its new Government. As a friend of Iraq  my Government supports its efforts at national reconstruction and welcomes the recent launch of the International Compact with Iraq to speed the process.  In Africa  stability and democracy are gaining ground  step by step  in Sierra Leone  Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The security and humanitarian crisis in Darfur  however  remains acute. The Secretary-General’s strong personal engagement has been critical in sustaining international attention and the flow of assistance to the beleaguered people of Darfur. Now  the smooth transition of the African Union Mission in the Sudan to the United Nations Mission in the Sudan must be accomplished in accordance with Security Council resolution 1706 (2006).  The performance of the United Nations cannot be measured by the creation of new machinery  any more than by the adoption of resolutions. As the Secretary-General has wisely reminded us  what matters is whether and how the United Nations makes a difference in the lives of people and in the conduct of States and non-State actors over time.    06-53005 26   Two new intergovernmental bodies  the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  seek to make just such a difference. Their success  however  is far from assured. A great deal is at stake. Will the new Human Rights Council usher in an era of renewed cooperation and solidarity in the work of the United Nations on human rights? Will the universal periodic review succeed in offering all States a candid and constructive assessment of ways to enhance their human rights practices?  Together  we can make the Council the pre-eminent global forum for the advancement of human rights around the world. Divided  we will lose a historic opportunity. The protection of human rights is not a matter of choice. It is the solemn duty of all responsible members of the international community. Without respect for human rights — in particular for the most vulnerable members of society — peace and development have little meaning.  The successful conclusion of the negotiations on a convention on the rights of persons with disabilities speaks to the essential humanity of the United Nations  which is its most precious asset. The Republic of Korea is fully committed to the principle of all human rights for all. We deeply empathize with the suffering in those areas of the world where human rights are given little more than lip service.   In particular  we fully share the international community’s concern over the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We call upon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to heed those concerns and to meet the call for dialogue on human rights.  The United Nations greeted the twenty-first century with a solemn promise to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Progress has been made  but it has been far too uneven from country to country and from region to region. Those countries in Africa that lack the minimum resources for development require the focused attention and assistance of the international community. Key goals  such as the eradication of extreme poverty and curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases  are in danger of slipping out of reach if we do not act quickly and decisively.  Meeting the MDGs by 2015 is a tall order  but we should never forget that  for the neediest members of humankind  the United Nations may be the only beacon of hope for a better life. The credibility of the United Nations largely depends upon its ability to accomplish its mission as regards the MDGs. While developing countries should take primary responsibility and ownership for their own development  we must honour our commitments and redouble our efforts to realize effective global partnerships for development.   The target established at the 2005 World Summit of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for development assistance forms the cornerstone of our strong commitment to achieving the MDGs. Innovative sources of financing  such as the air-ticket solidarity fund  need to be further explored. New sources of financing should not  however  be a substitute for existing official development assistance (ODA). As part of its commitment to doubling overall ODA by 2009  this year my Government launched Korea’s Initiative for Africa’s Development. Under that initiative  we will substantially increase our development assistance to Africa.   The key lessons to be drawn from the Korean experience over the decades are that education is key to development  and that women and girls are the most effective agents for change and social progress. Gender mainstreaming must be made a central pillar of policy strategy  in particular with regard to attaining the MDGs in such areas as eliminating poverty and combating HIV/AIDS. Lasting social change cannot be realized until women are fully incorporated into the process.  The urgency  complexity and scope of the three pillars of the work of the United Nations — peace and security  development and human rights — demand the highest standards of efficient  effective and accountable management. The highly decentralized nature of the United Nations system puts a premium on coherence and coordination. We must streamline the United Nations machinery  reorganize priorities and minimize redundancy. The High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence may offer some fresh ideas in that regard.  A number of valuable ideas for reforming United Nations management practices were contained in the Secretary-General’s report (A/60/692) entitled “Investing in the United Nations”. Some of those proposals have already been adopted by the General Assembly  while others await further consideration during this session.    27 06-53005   The Secretary-General’s comments on the evolving nature of the human resource needs of the United Nations were especially apt in the light of the accelerating demands for field staff. The General Assembly should give positive consideration to steps to make the Secretariat more mobile  integrated and multi-skilled. The United Nations needs to be able to deploy the best people where they are needed and when they are needed  to ensure that managers have the requisite expertise and experience to oversee highly dynamic and professional operations under often trying conditions.   Improving the accountability and oversight of the Secretariat while building upon the measures already taken over the past year remains a priority. The early launch of an independent audit advisory committee that is genuinely independent and professional  along with steps to ensure management accountability  would be instrumental in that regard.   The United Nations procurement system requires strengthened internal controls and transparent management to match the growing dimensions of its work.   As Member States and stakeholders in this vital Organization  we should address mandate review as a historic opportunity to streamline  focus and strengthen our collective efforts.  This unique world body was forged by men and women of conscience  courage and determination. Their genius was to understand that we need the United Nations not because we always agree but because frequently we do not. The United Nations remains no more and no less than what we make of it. The United Nations journey is never easy  but it is always well worth taking. We have come a very long way  but the road still stretches out endlessly before us. I have every confidence that  with the founding principles and purposes as our guideposts  and empowered by renewed faith and commitment  we can together go very far and fast in the challenging and exciting times to come.

"94",3891,"KWT",61,2006,"I am pleased to convey to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al Khalifa  on behalf of the State of Kuwait  its Government and people  our most sincere congratulations to her personally and to her brotherly country  the Kingdom of Bahrain  on her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We assure her of our readiness to cooperate with her seriously and constructively as she assumes her heavy responsibilities.  I cannot fail to mention here  with great appreciation and admiration  the prominent role of the Secretary-General in his ongoing efforts at the helm of this Organization to enhance and energize the work of its various bodies and to make them more democratic  transparent and capable of meeting the challenges of this century  and more effective in carrying out the duties assigned to them in the fields of peace  security and development.  In that context  Kuwait welcomes the Republic of Montenegro as a new Member of the United Nations.  In the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit  our leaders expressed their firm belief and conviction in the important role of this Organization as an umbrella for multilateral work. They drew a road map for us to follow as we seek solutions to the major international threats and challenges that threaten international peace and security  such as terrorism  the deterioration of the environment  human rights violations  poverty  hunger and the spread of such dangerous and infectious diseases as AIDS and malaria.  Of great concern is the emergence of new challenges to international peace and security that are no less dangerous than those aforementioned  such as the incitement of hatred  xenophobia  insults to religions  including Islamophobia  together with all kinds of racial  ethnic and religious discrimination.  A year after the adoption of the Outcome Document  and despite the extensive efforts made to follow-up the implementation of the Summit’s resolutions  there is still an urgent need to redouble the efforts to achieve our objectives in the fields of disarmament  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  counter-terrorism  setting a balance between developed and developing countries in international trade  and reform of the Security Council to enhance its authority and efficiency and give greater transparency and fairness to its decisions by according due consideration to the representation of the small States that make up more than half the membership of the United Nations.  The State of Kuwait hopes that efforts will be enhanced to promote dialogue and advance international coordination and cooperation to overcome the problems that impede the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in various regions of the world. Kuwait will maintain its course in adhering to the provisions  principles and purposes of international agreements and conventions.  While we take pride in the social  economic and political development that has been achieved in Kuwait  as reflected in the annual international reports issued by the specialized agencies of the United Nations  we will not be distracted from pursuing our efforts to further improve the social and economic conditions that favour the Kuwaiti citizen’s standard of living and prosperity. In that context  Kuwait will continue to support  within its means  the efforts of many developing countries to achieve their development goals. It will continue to do so through the Kuwaiti Fund for Economic Development  which finances infrastructure projects by granting soft loans  which to date amount to $12 billion and have benefited more than 100 countries around the world.   Kuwait also contributes to the funding of development projects in developing countries through    06-52885 42  United Nations programmes and specialized agencies  and regional organizations and associations. Within the framework of supporting international efforts to eradicate poverty  Kuwait announced last month that it will provide $300 million to the Islamic Development Bank to combat poverty in Africa.  Kuwait follows with grave concern the difficult security conditions in brotherly Iraq resulting from ongoing terrorist acts that target the Iraqi people  State institutions and economic and social facilities. Despite progress in the political process that has led to the formation of a constitutionally elected Government  the difficult security conditions impede similar progress in rebuilding what the previous regime destroyed as a result of its hostile policies towards its own people and its neighbours.  Kuwait reiterates its commitment to all relevant Security Council resolutions and vows to continue supporting the efforts of the Iraqi Government to promote democracy and respect for human rights  to rebuild  confront security problems and achieve national harmony between the various segments of the Iraqi people. We hope that the international community will also redouble its efforts in support of the efforts of the Iraqi Government and the League of Arab States to achieve security and stability in Iraq  which in turn will contribute to consolidating peace and security in the region. There is no doubt that a democratic  secure  stable and economically prosperous Iraq that respects human rights  is a master over its own decisions  without any interference in its internal affairs  and lives in peace with its neighbours will be in the interest of all the States of the region without exception. That is what Kuwait hopes for and seeks to achieve.  At the regional level  with regard to the issue of the three disputed Emirati islands  Kuwait supports the position of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council and hopes that negotiations will resume and intensify at all levels between the brotherly United Arab Emirates and the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to find a solution to that conflict in conformity with the principles and rules of international law and good-neighbourly relations  which would enhance the security and stability of the region.  Concerning the Iranian nuclear issue  Kuwait calls on all the concerned parties to spare the region any crisis that could undermine the security and stability of that vital region  which for the past two decades has been the theatre of conflicts and wars that have squandered the fortunes and resources of its countries and delayed their development. We therefore hope that action will be taken to resolve the crisis by diplomatic means. We urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to continue its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the international community in order to dispel any fears or doubts surrounding the nature and aims of its nuclear programme.  In that context  we affirm our position on the need to make the Middle East  including the Gulf region  an area free from all weapons of mass destruction. That zone must include Israel  which must accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and subject all its nuclear facilities to the safeguards regime of the IAEA.  In recent weeks  the brotherly Republic of Lebanon was subject to a vicious Israeli aggression that killed hundreds of innocent civilians  injured thousands of others  and made more than 1 million people refugees. Kuwait immediately and very strongly condemned those shameful and inhumane crimes against the brotherly people of Lebanon. Proceeding from its sense of duty and responsibility  and driven by close brotherly relations  the Government and people of Kuwait organized emergency relief operations to alleviate the suffering of the Lebanese people through the Kuwaiti Red Crescent society  other associations and the private sector. Kuwait also announced the donation of $324 million to the efforts to rebuild Lebanon.  While Kuwait welcomes the measures taken by the international community to implement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  it calls on Israel to cease its repeated aggressions against Lebanon and to respect its sovereignty  independence and territorial integrity. Kuwait also calls on the international community to assist the Lebanese Government to extend its control over all Lebanese territory and to support its endeavours to recover all of its rights  including compensation for its losses as a result of the Israeli aggression.  The core of the Middle East crisis is the Palestinian question. That issue  regrettably  remains stalled. International endeavours and efforts to move it forward are met with Israel’s intransigence and refusal to implement international resolutions  as well as its   43 06-52885  disregard for international conventions and the agreements it has signed with the concerned parties within the framework of the peace process.  The continued Israeli occupation of Arab territories will always be a source of tension and instability in the Middle East. Israel’s repeated military incursions in the occupied territories  oppressive practices against the Palestinian people  and undermining of the Palestinian Authority will not benefit the Israeli Government  nor will its continued aggression and deliberate destruction of Palestinian infrastructure and national Palestinian institutions secure its so-called security. The solution lies in resolving the root causes of the problem and by restoring usurped rights so that all the peoples of the region can enjoy peace and stability.  In that context  we renew our full support for the struggle of the Palestinian people to recover its lawful political rights and establish its own independent State over its own land with Jerusalem as its capital. We demand that the Israeli Government withdraw from all the Arab lands it occupies  including the Syrian Golan Heights  in implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the principle of land for peace. In that respect  we reiterate the importance of the Arab peace initiative adopted in Beirut in 2002 as the only strategic option for achieving a permanent  just and comprehensive peace in the region.  Since its founding  the United Nations has registered numerous accomplishments and demonstrated its efficacy in establishing peace and security in various parts of the world. It has helped prevent many problems from deteriorating and it has thereby become an indispensable tool of the international community in confronting global issues and challenges. It is our hope that the United Nations record of accomplishment in achieving peace and security will soon include Iraq  the Middle East  the Sudan  Somalia  Afghanistan and other countries that are still experiencing conflicts and wars that have killed countless numbers of their citizens  depleted their resources  destroyed their capacities and delayed their march towards development and progress. "
"95",3937,"LAO",61,2006,"Allow me  Madam  to congratulate you upon your election as President of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. I also wish to take this opportunity to convey our high appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his commendable achievements throughout his two consecutive terms of office  in the maintenance of peace and the promotion of socio-economic development the world over.   Despite the fact that today’s global trend is towards peace and development cooperation  the international situation continues to undergo rapid and complex changes. Numerous events during the past year demonstrate that world peace  justice and security are far from being secured  due to the use of force in the settlement of international problems and violations of the sovereignty of Member States. All of this creates major impediments to peace and development cooperation among States and peoples.  Globalization offers new opportunities for economic development  yet its benefits are unevenly shared. Developing countries  in particular the most vulnerable groups  namely the least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States  have taken important steps to launch trade liberalization and further integrate themselves into the world economy. Nevertheless  those countries continue to face many problems  primarily the lack of basic infrastructure  access to markets  capital  new technology  financing and investment. In order to solve those problems  the international community must create an enabling environment conducive to development  whereby the interests of developing countries can be tangibly promoted.   To enable the United Nations to meet the challenges ahead  it should be reformed in a comprehensive  inclusive and balanced manner. This would enhance the important role of the Organization in maintaining international peace and security and promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes and international cooperation for development. In addition  the United Nations reform process should include the revitalization of the General Assembly  the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council and reform of the Security Council in order to render it more legitimate  democratic and effective.   Despite the failure of the recent United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  the    06-53329 2  Lao People’s Democratic Republic considers that the Programme of Action is a living document and remains a framework for cooperation that empowers States to work towards its full and effective implementation.  The historic first meeting of heads of State or Government of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries  held on 14 September 2006 in Havana  Cuba  adopted a declaration reaffirming the right of access to and from the sea of landlocked countries  in accordance with international law  and underscored the importance of a midterm review to assess the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action. In my capacity as Chairman of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries  I appeal to the international community to further address the special needs and problems of that vulnerable group and to lend us support and assistance in our efforts to bring the midterm review process to a successful conclusion.  The country supports General Assembly resolutions that call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic  commercial and financial embargo imposed on the Republic of Cuba.   In the Middle East  there is an urgent need to implement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  which would bring normalcy to the situation in Lebanon and pave the way for a comprehensive solution to the Palestinian problem  in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions.  The situation in the Korean peninsula requires that problems should be resolved by peaceful means. In that regard  we call for the resumption of the Six-Party Talks based on the principles and commitments set out in the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005  in order to promote peace and security in the region.  The international community is deeply concerned to see the people of Iraq continue daily to endure significant losses in human lives and property. My country expresses the hope that peace  security and national unity will be restored as soon as possible.  In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  following the election of members of the National Assembly of the sixth legislature  held in early 2006  a new Government has been formed with the main tasks of consistently pursuing the policy of overall restructuring and ensuring the effective implementation of our five-year socio-economic development plan. That achievement would contribute to strengthening the nation’s political stability and social security and to consolidating solidarity throughout society.   Over the past five years  the national economy has grown at an annual average rate of 6.3 per cent  the incidence of poverty has declined from 48 per cent of the population in 1990 to 28.7 per cent in 2006  and opium cultivation has been completely eradicated. Public investment was concentrated in areas such as infrastructure and social development  particularly human resource development which focuses on education  health and culture. Moreover  foreign direct investment has swiftly increased.  For the coming years  the Government will concentrate all its efforts and actively mobilize all of the country’s forces and potential  in conjunction with favourable conditions and opportunities provided by the international community  for the purpose of ensuring the successful implementation of our national socio-economic development plan for the period 2006-2010  with a view to achieving steady economic growth at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent.   It is expected that by 2010  the slash and burn method of cultivation will definitely be terminated and that the problem of poor households will be basically solved. In addition  policies of support for small and medium enterprises will be implemented concurrently with the promotion and gradual expansion of industrialization  with a view to further improving the living conditions of our people and raising them to a higher level.   Similarly  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will further expand its relations and cooperation with the international community and will contribute actively to the regional integration process  particularly the integration of countries members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  with the aim of enhancing the role of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic as an efficient partner of the countries in South-East Asia and other regions of the world.  In closing  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates its determination to work in unison with the international community to create an environment conducive to promoting the well-being of all countries and peoples the world over.

"96",3980,"LBN",61,2006,"Today  I am honoured as I congratulate you  Madam President  on your election as the first Arab woman to ever preside over this body  hoping that this heralds a new era of better understanding of women’s aspirations and Arab causes.  I would also like to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for all that he has done for Lebanon and for the cause of peace in the region and the world as a whole.  I stand before the Assembly representing a terribly scarred country  a country whose ordeal is well known to members — my ravaged country  Lebanon. From 12 July through 14 August  my country was subjected to a barbarous aggression and to a rarely seen campaign of savage dismemberment  when hundreds of fighter jets emptied their loads of heavy and banned bombs  targeting mostly civilians  killing and maiming thousands  and destroying everything that made Lebanon a viable State. Obviously  this was a premeditated Israeli “sentence” to destroy my country and everything it stood for  it having been blessed and termed by His Holiness Pope John Paul II a “unique message to humanity ” that we can live together. This aggression became even more cruel when it won the tacit approbation of certain great powers.  Regrettably  the Security Council looked powerless in its attempts to stop the slaughter of Lebanon’s children and protect the peace in Lebanon and the Middle East. It took over a month and numerous calls for an immediate ceasefire for all those concerned to finally force a mere cessation of hostilities  which is yet to become a formal and final ceasefire.  It becomes self-evident for us to question the credibility of the United Nations in light of the Secretary-General’s acknowledgment that the delays in adopting Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) did indeed harm its credibility. Moreover  we cannot but have serious doubts as to this Organization’s ability to safeguard world peace when its resolutions are subjected to the vagaries of a very few world powers.  Today I ask: How many children  like the one in the photograph that I am holding up  will die because nobody does anything for them? How many children was this evil  vengeful machine of destruction supposed to have killed  before the world community decided to respond in defence of a “rightful” cause? Allow us to ask these questions  as we are filled with a deep sense of grief  when scores of our fallen citizens are still beneath the rubble.  Let me reassure the Assembly that this savagery did not weaken our people’s resolve nor shake its resilience as it rallied around its army and Government and embraced its national resistance  whose men faced occupation forces with epic valour  preventing their advance  and presenting Lebanon with yet another victory  in the name of justice and dignity.  While we stand under the United Nations umbrella to warn the world of the dire consequences we shall all face when the very foundations of this world body are shaken  it is also time to ask Israel  which owes its very existence to a United Nations resolution  to finally abide by past and recent resolutions.  As of 14 August this year  Lebanon has once again  without a shadow of a doubt  reasserted the fact that it is a nation that respects its commitments  while it implements international resolutions and proceeds to deploy 15 000 Lebanese army soldiers on the border between Lebanon and Israel — while Israel continues its daily breaches of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  having imposed a humiliating siege on Lebanon  and refusing to withdraw from the Lebanese territory in the Shaba’a farms sector  whose liberation remains Lebanon’s sacred right and duty. To this day  Israel continues to treat the people of Lebanon as hostages  kidnapping at will scores of its citizens  in a flagrant breach of that resolution.  Finally  Israel refuses to surrender to the United Nations the maps showing thousands of mines it left behind on Lebanese territory  while the case and fate of Lebanon’s prisoners in Israel remains very ambiguous  and no clear resolution of their ordeal is addressed anywhere.  Today  for the sake of peace  the world community is called upon to save Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) from oblivion  a fate that characterized scores of previous resolutions.   9 06-52988   Here  on behalf of a grateful country  I solemnly salute the fallen soldiers of peace who will hence share their obituary with that of our brave army soldiers and of our valiant resistance fighters  victims of prohibited weaponry  first tested by Israel on our soil and subject to an international investigation. We are hopeful that this time the world community will allow the investigation to reach its natural conclusion. This will constitute a clear indictment of Israel for its recurring violations of international conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  We also hope that the United States will not resort to its unfailing veto  thus allowing for the indictment of Israel’s actions in sympathy for the thousands of innocent civilians who were killed and maimed by the “smart”  cluster and phosphorus bombs  and those laced with depleted uranium.  Inspired by the principles and treaties of the United Nations  Lebanon retains the right of action to prosecute Israel before the competent bodies  most notably this Assembly  or the International Criminal Court  and to request the appropriate reparations for all the catastrophes Israel has inflicted on Lebanon.  I ask the Assembly today to stand by my country  as that will be recorded as a just and rightful stance. I also call upon it to differentiate between he who defends his country against Israeli aggression and occupation  and who strives to liberate his countrymen from decades of unlawful imprisonment  and those elements that perpetrate acts of wanton slaughter against their countrymen and others equally. I remind the Assembly that Lebanon’s experience with the scourge of terror goes back a long way  and has taken a very heavy toll on its armed forces.  The most recent aggression against Lebanon has left this small country terribly scarred  afflicted with thousands of dead and wounded  and a toll of destruction including several thousand housing units and hundreds of bridges  ports  airports and factories. And my message is: the will of our people to live and move forward has proved to be much stronger than defeat and despair. In record time  the people of Lebanon launched a campaign of reconstruction  made even more successful by instant comforting gestures of goodwill from many friends  at home and abroad. With such overwhelming support and assistance Lebanon will beat all the odds by achieving a stellar rebirth  thereby scoring another point in favour of humanity.  There is ample talk today of the need to reach a permanent and comprehensive peace in the Middle East  which Lebanon has stressed for decades. However  we are quick to point out that no such peace can be achieved in the Middle East without addressing the root cause of instability there  namely  the Arab-Israeli dispute and its core issue  Palestine.  Despite the horrid events in Lebanon  a window of opportunity has presented itself  and it should be fully exploited in order to reinvigorate the Middle East peace initiative  founded on the Arab peace initiative adopted during the Beirut Arab Summit of 2002.  The Arab peace initiative remains the suitable means to achieve a permanent  comprehensive and just peace  because it simply calls for the implementation of all United Nations resolutions as they pertain to the withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Arab lands  and for the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes. Only such a settlement will be capable of affording Lebanon and the neighbouring countries the stability and security they long for and will give Israel a sense of security — something it has failed to obtain through sheer force and aggression. Moreover  this should put an end to the haemorrhage in the Palestinian territories and foster moderation where despair has bred extremism and violence  most notably in Iraq  where it is vital for all of us to help that tortured Arab nation preserve its territorial integrity and the unity of its people.  Today there is incessant talk of a new Middle East as a harbinger of better things to come  and this prompts us to ask the following question. Is what we have witnessed in Lebanon and continue to see in Palestine and Iraq conducive to an environment of peace and tranquillity? Is this much heralded new Middle East attainable only through widespread strife  unimaginable bloodshed  sedition and oppression?  Our conception of a new Middle East is one that is coherent with United Nations resolutions  and that is in concurrence with the principles of justice and right as stipulated in those resolutions. Our idea of a new Middle East is one where a comprehensive peace settlement becomes reality  guaranteeing the rights of all; where Palestinian refugees return home  as stipulated in resolution 194 (III)  which comes long before Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  and therefore are not resettled in host countries; and where prisoners return to their loved ones.    06-52988 10   This is the only way to attain a stable Middle East. All else will plunge our region into further upheaval and bloodshed.  Should our conception of peace in the Middle East become reality  I assure the Assembly that the need for conferences  studies and discussions of terrorism will become moot. Should this happen in tandem with serious attempts to combat poverty and sustain acceptable levels of development in areas of need  this will certainly dry up the pools where terrorism draws its human and financial support.  I have recently read one of your statements  Madam President  in which you emphasize that overhauling the United Nations will be one of your top priorities. I commend you for that position  because no one appreciates the need for world peace more than the people of the Middle East  as we recognize that the preservation of world peace requires a United Nations capable of taking decisions and competent to see them through.  Here  I would like to reiterate what I said from this very rostrum only last year:  “The core values of a democratic and just world are best served by enhancing the capabilities of the United Nations and its instruments  and by reinforcing in-house democratic values.” (A/60/PV.13  p.1)  I believed that this institution should remain a sanctuary of world consciousness and “the primary defender of such human values as freedom  justice and peace.” (ibid)  Perhaps the reforms that have been carried out so far  such as the establishment of a Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  will constitute the necessary incentives for achieving a United Nations capable of safeguarding right and justice.  Taking into consideration current trends in world affairs  I propose to the General Assembly the creation of a commission leading to laying the foundations of a charter of the rights of nations  a charter equal in importance to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  a charter imposing on Member States — all States — a code of conduct founded on the principles of justice and the rule of law.  I come here from a country riddled with scars  rising from the rubble and ashes of aggression  to speak of justice. I do not pretend to pontificate from the helm of a tank. Lebanon remains a peace-loving nation  and it extends its hand to all those who share its peaceful vision  founded on a just settlement and extracting as such the seeds of oppression and violence. We trust that the forces of good will prevail in the end  because its flames burn in the heart of the righteous and because the sounds of jubilation will undoubtedly prevail over the beating of war drums and the sibilating of hate and violence.

"97",4026,"LBR",61,2006,"It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly at its sixty-first session on behalf of the people of Liberia  not just in my capacity as a leader  but as the first democratically elected woman President in Liberia and in Africa.  Let me congratulate you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session. We are proud of you  as the first Arab Muslim woman and the third woman to occupy this noble position. One of your women predecessors  Angie Brooks  hailed from Liberia. I was pleased to honour her last Friday in a moving ceremony here in New York for her dedicated services to our country.  Let me also seize this opportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  for his insightful knowledge and enlightened leadership in steering the affairs of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.  I wish also to welcome and congratulate the Republic of Montenegro for its admission as the one hundred ninety-second Member of the Organization and to assure its delegation of Liberia’s friendship  solidarity and support.  Let me now pay special tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan  the outgoing Secretary-General. I had the privilege of working with him as a former senior staff member of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  and I am personally aware of his dedication and commitment to the Organization  particularly the reform of the United Nations and the strengthening of its institutions. As I said to him during an honouring ceremony in Monrovia in July  we are proud of his record of enhancing the responsibility of the United Nations: the responsibility to protect the poor from the rich; the weak from the strong; and the humble from the arrogant. The Liberian people  and indeed all the people of Africa  are proud of him and his accomplishments.  Sixty-one years ago  when countries gathered in San Francisco to address issues related to the scourge of  and the scars left by  the Second World War  and the need for peace in a post-conflict world  Liberia was there and was a signatory to the Charter of the United Nations. The purposes and principles of the Charter have proved to be of durable value over the years.  Times have changed  and the world  too  has changed  beyond what we could have imagined when the Organization was established. Today we are truly a global village  interconnected physically and electronically  increasingly bound by a shared commitment to confront and overcome the challenges that threaten global peace  stability and the well-being of our human family.  Yet the original aims and objectives of the United Nations remain today as relevant as they were when the Charter of the Organization was signed 61 years ago. The need to maintain international peace and security  to cultivate friendly relations among nations  to achieve international cooperation in solving global economic  cultural  social and humanitarian problems  and to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute  and still remain  the cardinal objectives of the Organization.  Thus the main focus of this year’s deliberations — the implementation of a global partnership for development — serves to remind us that at this session the General Assembly must vigorously consider how to bring equity to the present international financial  trade and development structures; how to do more to create the conditions that will improve the standard of living of humankind everywhere; how to be sensitive to the needs of developing countries and assure them the dividends of globalization.   7 06-52737   In the new millennium  the United Nations should not operate on the basis of structures designed 61 years ago. We must therefore review the issue of the inequitable representation of the world’s peoples  as reflected by the present structure of the Security Council. It is in that regard that reform of the United Nations is urgent  especially with respect to the decision-making process in a Security Council which is undemocratic and hegemonic. The apparent continued violations of the United Nations Charter by some Member States on account of national interests represent a disguised threat to world peace and security.  Hence we must now find an acceptable solution under which nations large and small will receive equal treatment  in consonance with the Charter. The United Nations was conceived to promote world peace  democracy and equity for all.  I strongly support women and gender equality  and I look forward with interest to the report of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence  appointed by the Secretary-General earlier this year. It is expected to submit its final recommendations on United Nations reform. It is my hope that the establishment of a new  independent United Nations fund or programme for the empowerment of women and gender equality will be fully supported by Member States  and that such a fund will have sufficient resources to support targeted programmes for the empowerment of women.  Three years ago  representatives of contending warring factions  political parties and civil society in Liberia gathered in Accra under the auspices of international partners and signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Under provisions of that Agreement  a National Transitional Government was installed in October  2003  with a mandate to disarm combatants and prepare our country for elections. In October and November  2005  legislative and presidential elections were held  leading to our historic and landmark election by the Liberian people. The United Nations played a pivotal role in that national transformation. For and on behalf of the Liberian people  I wish to thank the United Nations and other international partners for the mammoth role they played in securing peace and bringing sanity to Liberia.  I wish also to express the deep appreciation and gratitude of the people of Liberia and their friends everywhere to the men and women of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for their active role in securing and enhancing peace and security in our country. I am proud to say that the leadership  commanders  men and women of the various contingents of UNMIL have largely comported themselves well and performed their mission with diligence and dedication. They have sacrificed greatly and persevered in a very challenging peacekeeping environment. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General deserves particular commendation for his foresight and support of our country’s reconstruction efforts. I thank them all sincerely on behalf of the Liberian people.  There are others to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the African Union  the United States of America  the European Union and the People’s Republic of China have been selfless and generous in their material  financial and moral support of our cause. I would be remiss if I did not single out the sacrifices made by our West African brothers and sisters to bring peace and sensibility to a suffering people. We thank them.  While we are enjoying a semblance of peace  we are particularly concerned about conflicts in other parts of the world. Of notable concern is the protracted crisis in the Middle East  which continues to create a state of restlessness and threatens world peace and security. From our experience  we have learned that no matter how protracted a conflict  the parties must sit around the table to iron out their differences and make peace. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian authorities owe their respective peoples  and the rest of us in the world  an obligation to break out of their cocoon of pride to resolve their differences harmoniously. We call for the active engagement of the United Nations in the peaceful and amicable resolution of the Middle East crisis.  Elsewhere in Africa  and especially in neighbouring Côte d’Ivoire  the standoff in the peace process is troubling. We call on the parties in Côte d’Ivoire to save their people from further punishment by resolving their differences. We call upon the United Nations to continue strong and decisive intervention to prevent it from becoming a wider subregional and regional crisis.    06-52737 8   The situation in Darfur and the slow pace with which it is being addressed require urgent attention. The continued stalemate over whether an African Union or a United Nations force should be deployed or maintained in the region exposes weaknesses in international cooperation and collaboration and demonstrates a lack of international will to address the sufferings and yearnings of the citizens and residents of Darfur  who plead everyday for international intervention. Darfur represents a potential humanitarian catastrophe. The world must not allow a second Rwanda to happen. In the new millennium  civilized nations must not be indifferent to any conflict  internal or external  regardless of the factors that fuel it.  The United Nations obligation to protect the helpless and innocent must remain paramount in that regard. My Government therefore calls on this General Assembly and the Security Council to exercise Chapter VII authority to restore peace  security and stability to Darfur.  On the other hand  my delegation is pleased with the successful holding of peaceful democratic elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo for the first time in 40 years. We look forward to seeing a peaceful conclusion of the final stage of that process and the ushering-in of a Government elected by the people of that country. It is our hope that the democratic gains made in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be sustained to enable the new Government to employ the vast national resources of that country for the benefit and welfare of its people.  Globalization has significantly altered the world and economic transactions among States. Africa will remain on the periphery of the global village unless we  as leaders  awaken to the imperatives of the ever-changing requirements. The first step towards that process of awakening is the promotion of democracy  free enterprise  good governance  human rights and social justice in our countries and across our continent.  There is increasing evidence that shows a direct correlation between the material and moral well-being of a people and their country  and the quality of their democratic environment. My Government is keenly aware of that reality. We have therefore promulgated policies that support openness  transparency  accountability and the equitable distribution of our meagre resources  while endeavouring to address the development and reconstruction challenges of the country.  Five years ago on 11 September  2001  a few miles from this very Hall  terror of unimaginable proportions struck  shocked the world and claimed close to 3 000 precious and innocent lives. As the people of the United States and the families of the innocent dead remember their tragic and irreparable loss this month  the people of Liberia join me in affirming our identification with their loss. We mourned with them then and we mourn with them now. We also resolve  as all civilized nations should  to join the global effort to fight terrorism anywhere in the world  recognizing that it is today the most signal challenge to world peace and collective freedom.  The world has witnessed a significant achievement in science and technology  leading to rapid industrialization and the improvement of the standards of living of humankind. Although the gains have led to the development of new medicines and other scientific knowledge  they also pose a threat to the environment and human survival.  Rapid industrialization and scientific discoveries can have a damaging impact on the environment. Unless there is a modification in our activities  the pleasure derived from successes in scientific achievement could  sadly  lead to tragedy and doom.  Thus  in the race for modernization and development  we cannot ignore the potency of the threats posed to our survival by environmental degradation. Saving the planet is required for the continued existence of its more than 5 billion inhabitants.  It is in that regard that my delegation supports the efforts of the Commission on Sustainable Development  the Kyoto Protocol and the decision reached on Agenda 21 during the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  intended to raise international awareness about the degradation of the environment and the need to reverse the negative trend. We trust that environmental issues will remain a priority on the global agenda.  Among the many impediments to social and economic development in Africa are poverty  poor health delivery systems  intraregional wars and civil conflicts. The devastating impact of HIV/AIDS  malaria and other diseases has contributed significantly   9 06-52737  to the slowing of progress on the African continent. While countries in the developed world are leaping ahead in science and technology  we are still groping to find the means to combat curable diseases and to join in the search to address incurable ones.  The twenty-fifth anniversary of the emergence of HIV/AIDS brought into focus the recognition that that deadly virus has eluded the sophistication of science and technology  thereby posing one of the greatest challenges to our development effort. The political will of Africa is challenged to act speedily to eradicate the virus and combat this health crisis.  The Government of Liberia welcomes the partial lifting of the arms embargo and the ban on timber imposed by Security Council resolution 1521 (2003). We also look forward to the lifting of the ban on diamonds as we seek to meet the requirements of Council resolution 1343 (2001). My Government pledges its fullest cooperation in the attainment of the objectives set out in those resolutions. We remain grateful to the international community for the continuous assistance and support provided to our country in its search for peace  security and post-war reconstruction and development.  Today  I stand here in testimony to the rebirth of my country — to our re-emergence to assume once more our enviable and critical role as one of the first independent African republics. We are aware that we face awesome challenges: the challenge of rebuilding our infrastructure  including education  health and other institutions; the challenge of addressing generations of gender imbalance  especially as it relates to the education of the girl child; and the challenge of promoting democracy  participation and fundamental freedoms and rights in an environment of equal opportunity.  We have made important beginnings  and we remain encouraged by the bilateral support provided by our bilateral and multilateral international partners. The recent visit of the Secretary-General and other similarly important visits by leaders of our continent and of international financial institutions clearly underscore the commitment of the United Nations and the rest of the international community to working with our Government to nurture and strengthen peace and to foster development.  In closing  let me say that today  as in the past  Liberia wishes to reaffirm its commitment to the United Nations  this timeworn but irreplaceable machinery and indispensable framework for international peace and international relations. We must all join our steadfast forces to make this institution work for the good of humankind. "
"98",4071,"LBY",61,2006,"My delegation has already congratulated the President on her assumption of her high office. I would like to reaffirm our confidence in her ability to accomplish her task and to lead our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I also wish to express our gratitude to her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  Foreign Minister of Sweden  for his conduct of the work of the General Assembly during the previous session. Lastly  we are indebted to the Secretary-General for his efforts to advance the process of reform at the United Nations and fulfilment of the purposes and principles of its Charter.  Last year our efforts were focused on reform. Some progress has now been made  and we have established the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. However  there is still a long way to go  since any reform that does not include the Security Council and enhance the role of the General Assembly will be of little value and will not meet the expectations of our peoples.  Unfortunately  our quest for reform of the Security Council has met with further encroachment by the Council on the functions and powers with which the General Assembly was endowed by the Charter. It is therefore incumbent on the Assembly to take immediate action to prevent the Council from infringing further on its authority.  We also take this opportunity to call on the permanent members of the Security Council not to hamper the reform efforts but rather to promote a genuine reform of the Organization. Such reform should place the power of decision-making in the hands of all members of the Assembly  a forum in which all States are entitled to vote. The Security Council will then become an executive tool for implementing the decisions of the Assembly. We can thus remedy the current situation in which the Council has become a domineering and inequitable body  applying double standards  lacking democracy and open to abuse of the veto.   History bears witness to the fact that the Council has never achieved peace and security in the world. On the contrary  it has served as a tool for aggression and wars and for the curtailment of peace mechanisms. Consequently  it is the General Assembly  in which all the peoples of the world are represented  that should take decisions on peace and war  and the power to apply Chapter VII of the Charter should be vested solely in the Assembly. The Security Council  with its limited membership  cannot be entrusted with such momentous decisions.  If we fail to agree on such a change  we must find a new formula for granting permanent membership of the Council. Permanent membership should be conferred on geographical groups rather than specific countries. We therefore demand that the African Union become a permanent member of the Security Council  as Africa is the only continent without a permanent seat on the Council.  More than three decades ago  Libya called for abolition of the veto. It submitted draft resolutions on this subject at the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and the six following sessions. Libya holds that this prerogative of the permanent members is the greatest of the obstacles preventing the Council from fulfilling its mandate. It therefore renews its call for abolition of the veto and urges the Assembly to take steps to restrict use of the veto until it is finally abolished. Within the framework of the current consultations on reform of the Council  we would like to reaffirm Libya’s adherence to the common African position issued by the Fifth African Union Summit  held in Sirte  Libya  on 4 and 5 July 2005  and later confirmed by the Extraordinary Summit of the African Union  held in Addis Ababa on 4 August 2005.  Maintenance of international peace and security is a noble goal of the United Nations. Undoubtedly  general and complete disarmament  starting with weapons of mass destruction  constitutes the essential component for achievement of this goal  which  however  will remain beyond reach unless all Member States cooperate in good faith and in a fully transparent manner. Libya has voluntarily abandoned all its programmes related to weapons of mass destruction and has expressed the hope that all States in possession of weapons of mass destruction or programmes for such weapons will follow its example.  It is important not to confuse weapons of mass destruction and nuclear non-proliferation with programmes for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Under international law  all States have the right to conduct research and develop their scientific capabilities for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.    06-53341 24  Libya strongly rejects the use of double standards when dealing with this issue and the practice of discrimination between States with respect to nuclear non-proliferation.  The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission is an important step in promoting peace in countries emerging from conflict. We hope to see soon the achievements of this new body in Africa  where the African Union has been able  with the assistance of the international community  to achieve peace in several African countries. African peoples look forward to the assistance of the United Nations in the consolidation of peace in order to implement development programmes and combat poverty  disease and illiteracy.  Terrorism is a phenomenon that threatens international peace and security. Such a threat cannot be countered by the action of a single State or group of States. Furthermore  it is a problem that cannot be resolved through attribution to a particular religion or nationality. It is also shameful and unacceptable to describe the legitimate struggle of a people against foreign occupation as an act of terrorism.  Libya was among the first States that called for coordination of international efforts against international terrorism. Fifteen years ago it called for a special session of the General Assembly to study this phenomenon and develop measures to combat it and eradicate its root causes. It is high time to respond to that call so that we can coordinate our efforts  under the auspices of the United Nations  to study this phenomenon and reach a clear definition of terrorism that distinguishes between terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples for self-determination and independence.  The change of the Human Rights Commission into the Human Rights Council reflects the great attention the international community gives to enforcing human rights and guaranteeing basic freedoms. We hope that the inception of this Council’s work will constitute a beginning towards addressing the issues impartially and non-discriminately  free from selectivity and double standards. We hope that human rights issues will not be used as a means of pressure against small nations. We emphasize that attempts by some States to use protection of human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of other States will only lead to the destabilization of peace and security  causing more problems rather than solving outstanding ones.  Sustainable development is a major challenge facing developing countries. It is incumbent upon the United Nations to establish an international partnership for development that aims to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  based on the activation of dialogue between North and South. All this should be done within the framework of respect for sovereignty  equality and the sharing of benefits  guaranteeing the achievement of the agreed goal of a 0.7 per cent allocation of the gross national product of developed countries as development assistance to developing countries. Furthermore  such a partnership should guarantee the appropriate application of all principles of free multilateral trade and the enforcement of all measures related to special and preferential treatment for developing countries  within the framework of World Trade Organization  including facilitating the accession of developing countries to that organization.  Countries with a colonial past bear the greatest responsibility for assisting developing countries as compensation for the damage caused them during the colonial period. The big Powers that waged wars on the territories of developing countries must bear responsibility for demining and removal of explosive remnants left in those countries. They should begin immediately to provide maps and the necessary technical equipment for the rehabilitation of the affected lands in some of the developing countries.  The massacres and repression that are committed by Israeli occupation forces in occupied Palestine against the Palestinian people and the flagrant violations of human rights confirm that the so-called peace process is but a mirage that will not yield any results  particularly given the inability of the Security Council to take any action to protect the Palestinian people and to compel the occupation force to respect its commitments and stop its aggression and crimes against the Palestinian people. Libya therefore reiterates its emphasis that any proposed solutions that seek to impose a fait accompli will not resolve the Palestinian question  nor will they provide peace for the area. The only solution that can achieve peace is to guarantee the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes and to establish a democratic State on the land of historical Palestine  in which Arabs and Jews live on equal footing  similar to South Africa  where blacks and whites manage to coexist after decades of conflict   25 06-53341  and bloodshed. Unless that is achieved  the region will continue to live in a state of conflict  in which no one will enjoy any peace or security.  The recent Israeli aggression against Lebanon and its targeting of the infrastructure and civilians there emphasize the need for urgent action to compel the occupation forces to withdraw from the Sheba’a farms and return them to Lebanon. Additionally  urgent action is needed regarding the withdrawal from and return to Syria of the occupied Syrian Golan. The Israelis should be forced to pay reparations for the damage they caused in Lebanon due to their brutal aggression.  The situation in brotherly Iraq is a cause of sadness and concern. It is  in fact  a catastrophe brought about by an occupation that has left behind tens of thousands of dead and hundreds of thousands of wounded and handicapped persons. No matter how optimistic we may be  this catastrophic situation will not end as long as there are occupation forces in the country  forces that feed divisions inside Iraqi society and encourage sectarianism in Government institutions. We believe it is high time to stop the bloodshed in Iraq and find a solution to end the crisis so that all Iraqis may enjoy peace and security  as well as their basic rights  in a unified and democratic Iraq enjoying full sovereignty and free from foreign forces and bases. "
"99",4104,"LCA",61,2006,"At the outset permit me to congratulate you  Madam President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  and to express Saint Lucia’s appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  for the excellent manner in which he spearheaded the work of the sixtieth session. We wish also to express our profound respect and gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his great vision  committed leadership and tireless efforts in promoting the noble ideals and values of our United Nations under the most difficult circumstances. We wish him and his family well in their future endeavours.  When in September 2000 we took the unprecedented step of pledging to meet eight Millennium Development Goals by 2015  it represented a belated admission that the development of every nation is a collective responsibility.  At that Summit we recognized that it was an affront to our basic humanity that so many people on our planet continued to live in conditions of abject poverty and deprivation; that so many continued to suffer the ravages of disease and war; and that basic necessities of life  taken for granted by most of us  remained unattainable by so many. We also recognized that unless we developed appropriate partnerships to deal with these problems they would persist  to our collective shame.   At this  our sixty-first session  we reaffirm our commitment to this notion of partnership as a significant modality for the attainment of our common goals. Saint Lucia is satisfied that the idea of partnership accommodates the spirit of multilateralism  which is the defining principle of our relationship within the United Nations. This multilateralist spirit must constantly be safeguarded and fortified  and that can only be accomplished by a strong and confident United Nations.   Saint Lucia takes this opportunity to once again express its determined support for the programmes of reform of the United Nations  designed as these are to create the capacity and conditions for the exercise of a strong central role by the United Nations within the international community. We salute the achievements to date  namely  the replacement of the moribund Human Rights Commission with the new Human Rights Council and the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission. We recognize that these bodies are far from perfect and will require continued attention by Member States. However  they reflect our determination to translate talk into action. Saint Lucia looks forward to continuing the discussions on the remaining items on our reform agenda — in particular  Security Council reform  strengthening and refocusing    06-53609 12  the General Assembly  the empowerment of the Economic and Social Council and management reform.  Saint Lucia continues to believe in the wisdom of the words of our Secretary-General  who  in his March 2005 report “In Larger Freedom”  opined:  “we will not enjoy development without security  we will not enjoy security without development  and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights. Unless all these causes are advanced  none will succeed.” (A/59/2005  para. 17)   As we seek to develop partnerships for development  utilizing the Millennium Development Goals as the benchmark  Saint Lucia has been moving steadily towards the attainment of some of the goals. Universal primary education has been largely attained  and we have gone further to introduce a programme of universal access to free secondary education for our young citizens. Saint Lucia is in the process of establishing a universal programme of free health care  and it has made significant progress in the area of maternal and child health. We are also working steadfastly in the battle against HIV/AIDS through education  early detection and treatment programmes  and also through the provision of free or subsidized antiretroviral drugs.  All these efforts have been bolstered in a practical demonstration of South-South cooperation through generous support and assistance from a number of developing countries in the areas of human resource development in the health sector and the construction of new health facilities. South-South partnerships are workable. We need to continue to develop and widen them for the betterment of developing countries.  Saint Lucia applauds the return of Haiti to democratic governance. This long-awaited development has led to the readmission of that country to the councils of the Caribbean Community. We recognize that the road to normalcy in Haiti will be a long and tortuous one  requiring a sustained political focus by the international community. Saint Lucia calls for the speedy release of development resources promised to that country in order that its Government and people may tackle in a meaningful way the numerous obstacles standing in its development path.  Saint Lucia also welcomes the Final Document of the Fourteenth Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement  held in Havana. This historic meeting addressed a wide range of regional and international issues  including the sanctity of international law  the promotion and preservation of multilateralism  the peaceful settlement of disputes  the right to self-determination and decolonization. The Final Document provides the international community with a workable road map for the development agenda far into this new century  with achievable solutions to many of the issues facing us today.  Saint Lucia notes and welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to and implementation of the outcome of the 2005 International Conference on Financing for Development (A/61/253). We call upon the developed countries represented at that forum to honour the commitments made there and at previous United Nations summits and conferences on trade  debt and finance  especially their promise to fulfil the goal of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product going to official development assistance. We believe it is imperative that the international community increase its efforts to address the indebtedness of poor developing countries. It is also important that these countries address the systemic deficiencies in the global economic and financial system. These deficiencies all constitute serious threats to the survival of developing countries like Saint Lucia.  Small island developing States  such as those in the Caribbean  the Pacific and Indian oceans and the Mediterranean  are extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change. We have already reached a dangerous level of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere  and urgent action is required to reverse this situation.   In this connection  the international community  in particular our developed partners  needs to take more aggressive action to promote the development and distribution of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in developed and developing countries alike. To assist developing countries to play their part in this connection there is a need to establish a global renewable energy and energy efficiency fund. Saint Lucia joins with its colleague members of the Alliance of Small Island States  and with other affected States  in calling for the international community to   13 06-53609  address the issues of sea-level rise and climate change as a matter of urgency.  The international community must honour its responsibility for  and commitment to  the full implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. We insist on the urgent and proper mainstreaming of the Strategy into the respective work programmes of the United Nations agencies and other bodies. Those who are the largest producers of greenhouse gases must bear responsibility for the damage they are causing to the global environment. From our own regional perspective  Saint Lucia welcomes the adoption of measures for the promotion of an integrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea area in the context of sustainable development. We welcome initiatives taken to this end by the Association of Caribbean States and the Caribbean Community.  Half a decade into the twenty-first century there are still some 16 Non-Self-Governing Territories under the review of the General Assembly. Most are small island territories in the Caribbean and Pacific regions. Their decolonization through a genuine process of self-determination is the unfinished agenda of the United Nations. In this connection  Article 73b of the Charter  on the necessity of promoting genuine self-government  should be respected. We call on the administering Powers to increase their level of cooperation with the Special Committee on Decolonization  and call on the relevant bodies of the United Nations system to assist the Non-Self-Governing Territories in the development of their capacity for self-government and in furtherance of their process of self-determination.  The year 2007 will mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade  which began the process of the abolition of slavery in the British Empire. A number of international events are planned throughout the globe to honour the memory of the millions who died during the middle passage  and those who subsequently perished under the horrors of chattel slavery in the Caribbean and the Americas. Saint Lucia joins with the countries of the African diaspora in the Caribbean  and with other like-minded countries  in supporting a United Nations commemoration in 2007 of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.  I could not end without referring to the serious impact of the rulings of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in respect of banana exports to our preferential markets in Europe. Few in the developed world can appreciate the mass social dislocation that this decision has caused  with thousands of independent farmers  employers in their own right  left without a livelihood through no fault of their own.   Consider that for every banana farmer in Saint Lucia who has lost his or her livelihood at least six persons have also been excised from direct participation in the economic system. The WTO has become synonymous with pain and suffering for farmers in Saint Lucia. In many instances the implementation of some of the obligations has created more hardship and poverty than previously existed. Accordingly  while economic and trade policy reform in principle holds much promise for small developing countries  the international community must come to grips with the fact that the one-size-fits-all approach is inappropriate and impractical. In this connection  a set of trading rules flexible enough to take into account the concerns of small States must be enacted. The principle of special and differential treatment must infuse all aspects of the new trade rules that we seek to create.  There is much unfinished business ahead of us. It is our expectation that the members of the Assembly will focus even more intently on the development of appropriate strategies for its resolution. We are confident that under your guidance and leadership  Madam President  the development agenda of the Organization will be advanced further. For its part  Saint Lucia remains committed to the ideals of multilateralism  and reaffirms its view that the United Nations offers the best opportunity for the achievement of peace  security and sustainable development for all."
"100",4131,"LIE",61,2006,"Madam President  let me first of all express my happiness at seeing you preside over the General Assembly. Your election sends a clear signal concerning the ever-stronger participation of women in decision-making processes worldwide. We value your impressive track record on women’s rights in particular  and we will assist you in every possible way in the fulfilment of your difficult task.  We can take pride in the many accomplishments achieved during the past session  most prominently the establishment of the Human Rights Council and of the Peacebuilding Commission. These are important institutional advances which offer us a real opportunity to do things differently and to do them better. They do not  however  automatically guarantee the results that we had in mind when we made the decision that new institutions were needed. No structural change  however skilfully crafted  can bring about substantive change in and of itself. In the area of human rights in particular  we must increase our efforts in order to create the truly new international discourse that is needed  based on cooperation and the even-handed implementation of international standards. Only a new partnership in the field of human rights  with the full participation of all stakeholders  including civil society and the private sector  can ensure that people worldwide enjoy all the human rights to which they are entitled. It is only through such a new partnership that we will be able to make the quantum leap towards an era of implementation.  One of the major issues that we did not resolve following the World Summit in September 2005 is Security Council reform. Here again  we are of the view that structural change is needed but that it is not sufficient in itself. On the one hand  the Council must be given a new structure and a different composition in order to maintain its credibility worldwide. It must better reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century  which are fundamentally different from those that prevailed at the time of the creation of the Organization. But we must also address the equally urgent necessity to improve the way in which the Council goes about its daily business.  Time and again we have witnessed occasions on which the Council did not live up to its mandate  as enshrined in the Charter  to act on behalf of the membership as a whole. A better representation of the views of the general membership is therefore essential for its effectiveness and credibility  in particular through a stronger involvement on the part of non-members of the Council that have a particular interest in  or expertise on  a given subject. We are satisfied to see that the Council has taken a step in the right direction in that regard  and we will remain committed to helping to improve its working methods.  Working methods and enlargement are clearly complementary elements of Security Council reform. It would appear that  after a pause of more than a year  it is time to try our hand again at expanding the Council  preferably through a sober approach that takes into account the experiences gained in 2005.  Like many before me  I would like to applaud Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his outstanding tenure at the helm of the Organization. One key element of his legacy is the high priority he has attached to the rule of law. We agree that the core strength of the United Nations is its solid grounding in international law  its proud track record in promoting international law  and the unique legitimacy it can provide in making decisions. In our globalized world     06-53317 32  in which non-State actors play an ever-increasing role  clear rules are needed which are applied equally to everyone  in a transparent manner.  However  we have yet to witness the advent of an era of the rule of law  as called for by the Secretary-General. On the contrary  we have witnessed a dangerous erosion of international law  in particular international humanitarian law  and we must urgently find ways to place the issue of the rule of law high on the agenda of the Organization. We will work with others to ensure that the General Assembly makes concrete progress on this matter during this session.  While there are negative trends in the area of respect for international law  we have made some significant advances  in particular in the area of international justice. It is now commonly understood that there can be no impunity for international crimes and that no one who has committed them is immune. This is a historic development which has found its most powerful expression in the establishment of the International Criminal Court. The Court is now seized of three situations  one of which was referred to it by the Security Council  and more than 100 States have become parties to the Rome Statute. This very strong momentum can be maintained only if States and  indeed  the Organization lend their active support to a judicial institution which fully relies on such cooperation in gathering evidence and arresting indictees. Most importantly  we must realize that peace and justice are  in the long run  complementary concepts  and we must uphold the principle that there can be no amnesty for the worst crimes under international law.  The international fight against terrorism poses a particularly complex challenge in the area of the rule of law. First  we must complement the existing international legal framework by adopting a comprehensive convention against terrorism. We have put forward our ideas in this respect and hope that they can help in reaching an agreement  which is long overdue. Secondly  it must be clear that the fight against terrorism and the observance of human rights and international humanitarian law are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Human rights are at the core of the value system of the international community  as we all recognized at the Summit last year. Curtailing them in the name of the fight against terrorism would therefore play into the hands of terrorists  who fight  this very system with fanatic zeal. Last but not least  the United Nations  and the Security Council in particular  must lead by example in upholding due process and the rights of individuals.  When I spoke in this Hall last year  I presented a mixed assessment of the outcome of the World Summit. On the one hand  I expressed disappointment at the vagueness or even complete absence of some aspects of United Nations reform  but I also warmly welcomed some real advances. The recognition of the responsibility to protect constituted such an advance; indeed  it was a real milestone in the Outcome Document. Today  we must acknowledge that the international community has not followed up the commitment it made at the World Summit with concrete action.  The situation in Darfur  irrespective of the definition of the crime in question  clearly falls within the scope of the responsibility to protect  but we have yet to see the action necessary in accordance with our common commitment to protect civilian populations.  The United Nations  in spite of its shortcomings  remains the only such Organization of global reach and is uniquely placed to address the complex challenges the world is facing today. However  it will be capable of living up to this role only if we re-establish the institutional balance within the system. In particular  the General Assembly must reassert its role as a central policymaking body and work on a par with the Security Council.  The most prominent topics for the Organization in the coming weeks are clear: the situation in Darfur  the Middle East  the nuclear programme of Iran and the appointment of a new Secretary-General. All these topics are dealt with in the Security Council  while the General Assembly plays at best a secondary role. The Assembly must  therefore  address in parallel  and make progress on  the development agenda in all its aspects  system-wide coherence  disarmament  Security Council reform and other priority areas of the work of the organization. A better division of work between the two most important organs will make the Organization as a whole more effective and more efficient. It is  therefore  in the common interest of all States to make the General Assembly the central policymaking body it was designed to be by the founding fathers. "
"101",4178,"LKA",61,2006,"On behalf of the Government and people of Sri Lanka I congratulate you  Madam President  on your assumption of the high office of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am happy to note that a lady from a sister Asian country will guide us through the current session. As Sri Lanka was the first country in the modern world to elect a woman as Head  of Government — Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike — your assumption of this high office is of special significance to us. To Mr. Jan Eliasson I convey our gratitude for the leadership he provided during the work of the sixtieth session.  In 1970  when I was first elected to the Parliament of Sri Lanka  a paragraph in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations gave substance and direction to my future political life. It was “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights  in the dignity and worth of the human person  in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small”. Having been a human rights campaigner at the grassroots level throughout my political life  I found it natural that my new Government should be committed to carrying the message of democracy to all corners of our multi-ethnic  multicultural and multi-religious country. “Democracy  equity and prosperity” is our clarion call.  In addition  my country has been influenced by the core Buddhist values of non-violence  loving kindness  compassion  equanimity and mindfulness. With this sense of direction  our Government has committed itself “Towards a new Sri Lanka”  guided by a vision of peace  where every Sri Lankan citizen may live with dignity and self-respect  in freedom and without fear  free of want  and where every child may enjoy childhood and grow up with hope and expectation.  However  Sri Lanka’s dream is threatened by a terrible affliction that impedes development  undermines democracy and challenges fundamental freedoms. I refer to the bane of terrorism which confronts my country and many other countries of the world. I reaffirm my Government’s firm commitment to supporting all global efforts to combat terrorism whenever and wherever it raises its ugly head. Terrorism has become closely intertwined with organized crime. It is now directly linked with people smuggling  the trade in illicit drugs  the illegal trade in small arms and money-laundering. Terrorism is a major impediment to development and poses a terrible challenge to civilized society. We support all measures undertaken in the United Nations to meet this challenge. We have ratified all United Nations conventions in this regard.    06-52879 8   In our capacity as Chair of the ad hoc committee on measures to eliminate international terrorism we shall spare no effort to realize the international legal framework to facilitate our common struggle against terrorism. It is our fervent hope that the comprehensive convention on international terrorism will soon become a reality.  The illicit trade in and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has contributed to the escalation of many local conflicts because of the easy availability of arms for non-State actors. Sri Lanka is concerned that  despite the commitment of the international community to wipe out this menace  the impact at ground level throughout the world is limited. We hope that the United Nations Plan of Action on this matter will be fully implemented and its scope further expanded in the future.  With regard to terrorism  I speak from personal experience in my own country. Exploiting minority concerns  which we are addressing politically  a ruthless terrorist outfit in Sri Lanka  the LTTE  has been terrorizing our people for over two decades. In an age when the world seeks dialogue and peace  the LTTE devotes its full force to violence  suicide bombings  massacre of civilians  indiscriminate armed assaults and the conscription of young children for war. Assurances given to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict on the conscription of children for armed combat have been blatantly violated.  At the presidential election in November last year people in certain parts of Sri Lanka were cruelly deprived of their freedom to vote. Furthermore  in an act of ethnic cleansing more than 60 000 Muslims were forcibly expelled from their homes in the north.  Our Government believes that some of the concerns of minorities in my country have deep roots. In this connection I recall the following words in the Constitution of the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO): “since wars begin in the minds of men  it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed”.  Soon after my election  despite the violence unleashed by the terrorists  I expressed the conviction that we needed to address the causes of the conflict from a fresh perspective and with a new approach to develop a sustainable solution. We examined this issue with an open mind  and looked at every option with a view to evolving a national consensus to achieve an honourable peace in an undivided country. A consultative process is currently under way to prepare constitutional proposals to address the concerns of the minorities. I have invited the LTTE to participate in the process of seeking a solution to the conflict through dialogue.  As one of the oldest democracies in Asia  we are firmly convinced that the restoration of democracy  the creation of space for dissent  and the promotion of human rights in the conflict-affected areas are essential elements of a successful and sustainable process of peace. I hope that the international community will continue to extend to us its fullest support towards the transformation of the LTTE into a democratic civilian organization.  Our Government firmly believes that terrorism cannot be eliminated through military means alone. We remain fully committed to talking with the LTTE  either directly or through a facilitator. It is our hope that the LTTE will transform itself from a terrorist outfit into one that is committed to dialogue and democracy. Our Government stands ready to respond to any display of good will and a move towards a non-violent approach.  We continue to take unilateral humanitarian measures  which extend even to terrorist cadres. As a responsible Government we will continue to provide unhindered access to conflict-affected areas to the International Committee of the Red Cross  United Nations agencies and other recognized humanitarian agencies.  More than 53 000 Muslims were evicted from their homes by the terrorists following the recent violence. They are the innocent victims of the LTTE’s ruthless policies. Following Government counter-measures  almost all have now returned to their homes. The Government has assumed responsibility to provide medical supplies  food and other essential items to the internally displaced persons living in the affected areas.  I am pleased to state that  despite the conflict in our country  the economy of Sri Lanka continues to grow at a commendable rate. In the first quarter of this year we recorded growth of 8.1 per cent — the highest in 28 years. With our determination to further enhance growth with equity  we have adopted an economic   9 06-52879  strategy that will provide opportunities for all citizens  while giving adequate space to the private sector as the engine of growth.  We continue to maintain the highest rating in South Asia on the Human Development Index. We have already achieved some of the Millennium Development Goal targets in primary school enrolment  gender equality and maternal and infant mortality rates. We hope that the increased economic opportunities in the country will further encourage the LTTE to opt for a negotiated peace.  We follow a pro-poor development strategy  with a focus on regionally balanced growth. Our objective is to achieve overall development while raising the income levels of the poor through the empowerment of communities living at the grass-roots level. In this connection  Sri Lanka hopes that debt forgiveness will continue to be expanded to encourage the development of developing countries. It is only right that those who reach the heights of development should pause to lend a helping hand to those who have fallen behind due to circumstances.  I wish to acknowledge the role of President Clinton  the United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery  and the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for their assistance with tsunami-related support. I also acknowledge the support given by many other countries. I am pleased to state that  despite being a developing country  we are now well on the way to recovery from this massive disaster  in many instances as a result of the efforts of our own people. We urge our development partners to stay involved with us in this long-term effort.  We in Sri Lanka see the United Nations as indispensable in creating a just and secure world order. We  the 192 Members of the United Nations  must continue to have faith in our collective capacity to reform the United Nations so that it is made more effective and more relevant to the needs of its Members in facing the challenges of the twenty-first century.  We are pleased with several important measures that have been adopted since the sixtieth session. Given my personal commitment to the promotion of human rights at both the local and international level  the establishment of the Human Rights Council  with enhanced status and capacity to promote and protect human rights worldwide  is a cause for delight. I am happy that Sri Lanka was elected to the Council last May. In honouring a pledge made during the presidential election last year  we have already started work on crafting a human rights charter in Sri Lanka. Consistent with our goal of safeguarding human rights  my Government will establish an international panel to observe investigations into certain alleged human rights violations that my Government has already condemned.  The establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission is another important landmark achievement of the United Nations this year. We are pleased that Sri Lanka has been elected to its organizing Committee as a founder member of that important body. The needs and concerns of those affected  the specific theatres of conflict  and the realities on the ground of each specific situation must necessarily be taken into account in the Commission’s work.  We are also encouraged by the general agreement that the Security Council must be strengthened  as it does not reflect current geopolitical realities. We therefore look forward to the continuation of work towards Security Council reform  towards making its composition more representative and its decision-making more democratic. It is essential that the Security Council reflect the current geopolitical realities in Asia  Africa and Latin America.  For long years now  on the basis of our commitment to human rights and dignity  we have had a lasting interest in seeing the emergence of peace in the Middle East. Recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people is of concern to me and to my country. Many Sri Lankans have in recent years made the Middle East their temporary home. We are pained by the recent escalation of violence in that region and the devastation in Lebanon. It is our sincere hope that Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) will pave the way for peace and security for Lebanon and the region.  The Preamble to the Charter requires that we “unite our strength to maintain international peace and security”. Let us all  Members of the United Nations  focus sharply on this commitment. Let us dedicate ourselves to its realization and let us mobilize our collective energies towards the achievement of peace and security worldwide.  Let us make peace the goal of the present decade. Let us all unite for peace. May all living beings be free    06-52879 10  of suffering  be healthy and be prosperous. May the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem be with you all. "
"102",4220,"LSO",61,2006,"My delegation associates itself with the compliments extended to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly  to her predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  and to the Secretary-General. It would be remiss of us if we did not express our delight at the fact that our proceedings are being led by a lady President this year.  We meet in the aftermath of the worst conflict in the Middle East. This conflict has brought untold misery and has resulted in unnecessary loss of life  displacement of people and wanton destruction of property. In the midst of all this  the Security Council remained pitifully helpless.  The delay by the Security Council in reacting to the Israel-Lebanon conflict graphically demonstrated the Council’s extreme inadequacy in responding urgently  with prompt and decisive action  to international armed conflicts. It is precisely such    06-53005 12  failures that lend credence to the call for reform of the United Nations  in particular  reform of the Security Council. In this regard  the well-known position of the African Group has never made more sense than it does now.  The African continent still experiences internal armed conflicts. The African Union (AU)  without usurping the powers of the Security Council  has taken the initiative to resolve some of those conflicts. However  the African Union’s resources and capacities are limited. It is against this background that the African Union  through its Peace and Security Council  resolved to hand over the Darfur mission to the United Nations. It is our hope and earnest plea that the current misunderstanding between the United Nations and the Government of the Sudan will be resolved as a matter of urgency. The United Nations  particularly the Security Council  cannot afford to be a helpless spectator to yet another genocide.  My delegation calls for concerted efforts by the international community  and by the United Nations in collaboration with the African Union  to find a lasting solution to the crises in Somalia and Côte d’Ivoire. With regard to Somalia  the efforts of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development to broker an agreement between the Transitional Government and the Islamic Courts must be complemented by the international community  specifically  the United Nations. There is also an urgent need to lift the arms embargo so that the Transitional Government may be able to function.  We congratulate the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  who  following decades of undemocratic rule and civil war  recently exercised their inalienable right to elect a Government of their choice. It is our hope that with continued assistance from the United Nations  particularly from United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  and other partners  the second round of elections  scheduled for 29 October 2006  will proceed peacefully.  We likewise commend the people of Burundi on the signing of a peace agreement between the Government and the Forces nationales de libération (FNL). This should enable them to focus on the development issues of their country.   Furthermore  we congratulate the Government of the Republic of Uganda on the initiative aimed at finding a political solution to the protracted war with the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). That war has taken its toll on the people of Uganda and has contributed to instability in the region.  We express our solidarity with the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara in their struggle for self-determination and their quest for everlasting peace. Surely  things do not have to deteriorate to the level of the Israel-Lebanon conflict before the international community snaps into action in these two volatile situations.  Following the 2005 World Summit  and in the context of the reform of the United Nations  my delegation notes with satisfaction the creation of the Human Rights Council  the operationalization of the Peacebuilding Commission and the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund  among other achievements. These are timely events that continue to prove the relevance of this Organization in the twenty-first century.  My delegation also notes the efficient manner in which the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs responded in some countries that faced major man-made or natural disasters over the past year. That can be attributed to the newly established Central Emergency Response Fund. It is our hope that the Fund will continue to live up to the expectations of Member States.  The United Nations was founded on the interlinked and mutually reinforcing pillars of development  international peace and security and human rights. The issue of development deserves the undivided attention and commitment of Member States  just as do the issues of peace  security and human rights. Hence the call at the 2005 World Summit for a timely and full realization of development goals and objectives agreed upon at major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic  social and related fields.  My delegation is deeply concerned that Member States were largely divided between the South and the North regarding how to follow up on the development section of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). We are indeed disheartened that  due to a divergence of views on this important issue  the General Assembly was not in a position to suggest concrete actions to implement commitments made at the relevant conferences and summits.   13 06-53005   It is past time for the General Assembly to suggest concrete actions on how to  among other things: fulfil the commitments to address the special needs of Africa; seriously address the uneven progress made by the least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island developing countries in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); address issues relating to trade  agricultural subsidies and the transfer of vitally needed resources to developing countries; and fully implement the global partnership for development as set out in the Millennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus  the Johannesburg Plan of Action and the 2005 World Summit Outcome.  My delegation hopes that at its current session the General Assembly will  among other things  finalize all details regarding the convening of a review conference on the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus. Furthermore  we hope that all stakeholders will reaffirm their commitment to the full implementation of the outcomes of the recently held high-level meetings on migration and development and on review of the implementation of the 2001 Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries.  There is definitely an inherent global benefit  for all countries  in the pursuit of development cooperation based on genuine partnership and mutually beneficial arrangements. The realities of globalization  liberalization and interdependence have demonstrated the inadequacies of the traditional modes of financing for development  such as official development assistance  foreign direct investment  trade and other forms of capital flows.  If all Member States are to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015  certain measures must be undertaken. First  official development assistance must be doubled. It must also be timely  predictable and dependable. Secondly  all partnerships with New Partnership for Africa’s Development must be linked to the Millennium Development Goals and other agreed upon development goals and targets. Finally  there must be complete debt cancellation  not just for the highly indebted poor countries  but for the least developed countries as well.  The suspension of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations was a disquieting development for some of our countries. While Africa had on various occasions expressed concern on the limited progress made in negotiations on issues of major interest to the continent  our faith in the negotiations never wavered. We truly believed  and we still do  that there is a common understanding that trade is the most effective route out of poverty  and that the prosperity and security of all nations  rich or poor  strong or weak  are dependent on  inter alia  free and fair trade.  Much has been said about the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Its consequences are now commonly understood. Conferences at the highest levels have been held  subregionally  regionally  continentally and globally. These conferences discussed at length the importance of economic  technological and medical developments to subdue and defeat HIV/AIDS in affected countries. It is now time for words to be followed by concrete actions targeting  in particular  infected and affected groups and lowering infection prevalence rates.  My delegation regrets the paralysis that has befallen the United Nations disarmament machinery. Also regrettable is the failure of the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to produce a consensus substantive outcome document. Equally regrettable is the absence of a section on non-proliferation and disarmament in the 2005 Summit Outcome Document. The coup de grâce  however  is the failure to agree on an outcome document of the 2006 United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons In All Its Aspects  adopted in 2001.  Thus  Member States should not run away from the blatant truth that  during the sixtieth session of the Assembly  the stalemate that  over the past four years  has characterized negotiations regarding non-proliferation and disarmament  finally became abundantly clear to all nations. For small arms and light weapons remain the weapons of choice that are indiscriminately used in conflicts  as well as in other forms of violence  including criminal behaviour. Yet they are still so cheap and so easily accessible that  in some remote villages  they are exchanged for chickens.  Terrorism continues to pose the greatest threat to human security. In this regard  I wish to welcome the adoption by the General Assembly of the United    06-53005 14  Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). However  it is unfortunate that the General Assembly’s Ad Hoc Committee on International Terrorism has still not been able to conclude a comprehensive convention on an international response to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The fact remains that Member States have a moral obligation to overcome their long-standing differences on the definition of terrorism. Failure to agree on a definition  however  cannot and must not be used as an excuse for not decisively confronting the scourge of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  Following the adoption of Security Council resolution 1696 (2006) on 31 July  and the subsequent response by the Iranian Authorities  it is our fervent hope that all parties to the issue will constructively engage in seeking a lasting solution to avert possible economic and diplomatic sanctions and to guarantee Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme.  Last but certainly not least  this session marks the end of tenure of office for an illustrious son of the African soil  a distinguished diplomat and statesman  in the person of His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan. He leaves a legacy for this august body which every one of us must emulate in the best interests of the peoples we represent and serve. It is therefore befitting to pay tribute to him and to wish him and Mrs. Nane Annan a well-deserved rest and a future filled with happiness. He will  needless to say  be inundated with our calls for his wisdom and advice in the service of mankind.   Our standing ovation and the declaration made in honour of His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan during the last African Union Summit held in Banjul  Gambia  said it all. With typical eloquence  he delivered a few days ago in the Assembly before the world’s leaders a rich statement filled with emotion. No wonder that even the world leaders accorded him a standing ovation. His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan has run his lap with excellence. He deserves a medal of honour. "
"103",4246,"LTU",61,2006,"The previous session of the General Assembly created high expectations for reform and comprehensive renewal that would ensure the continued success and relevance of the United Nations well into the twenty-first century. Thanks to the initiatives launched by the Secretary-General  today we have the Peacebuilding Commission; the Central Emergency Response Fund; the recognition of a collective responsibility to protect  where a State fails to protect its citizens from genocide and crimes against humanity; and a new Human Rights Council. Lithuania is committed to work to ensure that the new Human Rights Council can strengthen the protection and promotion of human rights around the world.  It is said that State-building is a long and difficult process. That is precisely why United Nations assistance in this area is much needed. The Peacebuilding Commission brings renewed hope that post-conflict countries can avoid slipping back into chaos. But institutions alone do not count if they are not supported by political will. Strong international commitment is necessary in offering hope of a better life wherever nations are struggling to get back on their feet.  Lithuania’s lead in a Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan has given us first-hand understanding of the vital importance of the sustainability and continuity of such efforts. However  whether in Afghanistan or elsewhere  our efforts will be successful only to the extent that the nations themselves are fully engaged in post-conflict State-building and rational  market-sound economic development. Today  we welcome an increasing Afghan capacity to rebuild the country  and we are encouraged by the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force area of responsibility. On the other hand  the challenges ahead will require ever-increasing focus and further efforts on the ground.  The tragic events in the Middle East over the past 12 months have vividly demonstrated the human and financial costs of inability to reach compromises and final solutions regarding problems that have divided societies and poisoned the region for long years. Thus  the effective promotion of a comprehensive peace plan in the Middle East is topical as never before. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and major donor conferences offer hope for the development of a sovereign and strong Lebanon. Let us make this a reality by pooling our efforts and contributing to this cause today  not tomorrow. The two States of Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace is our goal.  Few security issues are as dramatic as terrorism  with its indiscriminate targeting of civilian lives in an ever-expanding geography. Five years ago  the people of this very city suffered a brutal and cold-blooded attack on the values of humanity and tolerance that forever changed the world as we knew it. It is therefore essential that we unite our efforts to ensure that this never happens again. We welcome the Assembly’s adoption of the United Nations Global Anti-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  and we call for the completion of work on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism as soon as possible and for its being put into practice.  To succeed in our fight against terrorism  we must not yield to fears that separate; instead  we must build on our common humanity. We therefore hope the Alliance of Civilizations will become an integral part of our interaction  promoting solidarity  inclusion and understanding and reinforcing the values and principles which extremists seek to undermine.  Furthermore  we should redouble our efforts to tackle the issue of disarmament and non-proliferation. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  the    06-53005 8  challenges to non-proliferation continue to mount. Lithuania strongly supports the strengthening of the effectiveness and efficiency of the IAEA Safeguards System. Compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the relevant Security Council resolutions is a key to global security. We therefore call on all States to exercise full compliance in this area  vital to our common peace and security.  At the same time  security  as it is typically defined  has a broader meaning now. We should deal with climate change  energy security and dire water or food shortages with equal attention.  We must be firm in our common fight against terrorism  but we must be just as firm in fighting poverty and upholding the dignity of the individual. We need to put the available resources to the best possible use  such as ensuring significant progress in the implementation of the internationally agreed upon Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Lithuania is proud to follow up on these commitments. As a new donor country  we know that it will take time to measure up to the high expectations in the field. We provide increasing amounts of advice and assistance  in more and more places. Over the past year alone  our development aid has grown by 60 per cent. We are determined to further increase our aid and diversify its geography. We remember what it meant to receive help when we needed it  and we know and accept the responsibility to now help others in our turn.  Only a comprehensive approach can ensure that the inextricable link between security  development  and human rights that we all agreed on will translate into a real and positive impact on the lives of countless millions of human beings around the world.  As we pursue the commitments already undertaken  we must look beyond tomorrow to be able to empower the United Nations to deal successfully with the challenging diversity of issues and concerns of all our nations.  It is natural that in debating such vital issues as the reform of the United Nations  we  the Member States  have disagreements. However  we should also remember that  while we discuss our disagreements here in New York  millions of the poorest are suffering from degrading starvation  millions of children are dying from preventable diseases  and millions of people have nothing to rely on but the United Nations to protect them. If we want the United Nations to effectively deal with development challenges  counter new deadly threats and restore the value of human life to countless people around the world  an ongoing change is a must.  I therefore urge the United Nations to continue in the vital areas of management reform and mandates review in order to increase the Organization’s efficiency and effectiveness for the benefit of all.  We also urge strengthening of international environmental governance and  translating the World Summit agreement on the collective responsibility to protect into a willingness to act  when such action is needed  and ending impunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community.  A vital element of the United Nations renewal is the issue of Security Council reform. Lithuania has consistently supported reform  in terms of both membership and working methods. Enhancing the Council’s legitimacy through such reform will enable it to improve the discharge of its primary responsibilities vis-à-vis international peace and security.  A renewed Security Council should give adequate voice and representation to all regions. As a member of the East European Group  Lithuania believes that this Group  too  deserves better representation on the future Security Council. Our collective experience of dramatic and peaceful transformation of our societies has a lot to offer. In this respect  we believe  our Group can offer an excellent candidate for the post of Secretary-General.  Despite its flaws  the United Nations remains the only organization with the potential to embody a truly global and effective spirit of multilateralism. Therefore  whatever we do  we should continue to ask ourselves: are we  the Member States  doing enough to help the United Nations fulfil its promise to mankind? We are a world family and we have responsibilities to one another. "
"104",4290,"LUX",61,2006,"Two years ago  at this same rostrum  as the conclusion of my statement (see A/59/PV.10)  I quoted these famous verses of the Spanish poet Antonio Machado:   “Traveller  your footsteps  Are the road  and nothing else;  Traveller  there is no road.  The road is made by walking;  Walking makes the road.”  What a road we have travelled since then. Indeed  the opening of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly is above all the opportunity for us to look back and assess the progress we have made  particularly since the September 2005 World Summit  but also to try to assess the work that still needs to be done to implement the noble ambitions we all agreed    06-53323 10  upon one year ago in this Hall where we meet every year as a real parliament of nations. On that historic occasion  we forcefully reaffirmed that peace and security  development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system and constitute the essential element of a more just and a more peaceful world order.  One year later  what have we accomplished  and how can that progress be assessed in the light of these criteria: the reality of the situation  and the way in which the complex international situation and the never-ending future are evolving?   When we look at the current situation  we have to see that areas of shadow coexist with reasons for hope  and we have some cause for concern. More than ever  the Middle East is the centre of deep political  military  socio-economic and cultural tensions  with military confrontation on Lebanese lands and bombings in northern Israel  to mention only the most recent examples. A month of war has left behind it a terrible legacy of death and injury  destruction and contamination by mines and unexploded ordnance  as well as major economic consequences. My country immediately joined international solidarity efforts. The Stockholm conference enabled us to coordinate international support and to move towards reconstruction under the aegis of the United Nations and the Lebanese Government.  But beyond that immediate reaction  now that a cessation of hostilities has been brought about — late  it is true — we now have to consolidate the ceasefire and lay the foundations of a sustainable political process  the principal elements of which are defined in Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). As reaffirmed a few days ago from this podium by the current President of the European Council  Ms. Tarja Halonen (see )  the European Union is prepared to fully play its role in this context. Already  European contributions — to which my country is committed to participate — constitute what Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called the backbone of a strengthened United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).   So the task of supporting the emergence of a fully sovereign and independent Lebanon which can exercise its sovereignty and a monopoly on armed force throughout its territory must be completed; all regional players must make their contribution to this process. By bringing about the lifting of the blockade of Lebanon  and by concretely addressing the issue of prisoners  the Secretary-General has laid the foundations for a lasting solution. We thank him for his effective work.  I was in Beirut  Tel Aviv and Ramallah a few days ago  and I realized once again the extent to which the absence of true peace in this region has had a negative effect on civilian populations  particularly in the occupied territories  where the humanitarian situation is getting worse day by day. I also realized the extent to which confrontation  violence and despair tend to spread and become entrenched. It is this grievous machine that we have to stop. More than ever before  it is clear that there can be no military solution or unilateral solution to the continuing conflicts in the region.   On 15 September  the ministers for foreign affairs of the European Union reaffirmed our full support for the search for a negotiated solution. We welcomed the announcement by President Abbas with regard to an agreement on the formation of a government of national unity  and we expressed the hope that such a government’s programme would reflect the principles of the Quartet. Two days ago  as we know  the Quartet too endorsed that position.  However  persistent tension in the Middle East must not divert our attention from Africa. That continent continues to be scourged by poverty  disease and armed conflict. But at the same time there is hope  thanks to the continent’s extraordinary vitality and creativity. Although far too many internal conflicts and international crises remain in many areas in Africa — for example  in Côte d’Ivoire; the Sudan  in particular the Darfur region  where a large-scale humanitarian crisis is looming; the Horn of Africa; and other areas as well — there are some signs of hope  sometimes fragile to be sure  are to be seen in countries as diverse as Liberia  Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  where an electoral process of unprecedented scale is under way with the massive support of the United Nations and the European Union  among other partners.  The African Union is also playing an increasingly positive role in crisis management on the African continent  as illustrated by its action in Darfur through the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS). It is essential that this crucial action be speedily taken up by the deployment of an enlarged United Nations   11 06-53323  mission  as provided for in Security Council resolution 1706 (2006).   With the creation and the operationalization a few months ago of the Peacebuilding Commission  another World Summit commitment has now been met. The United Nations now has an innovative instrument to manage post-conflict situations in order to ensure optimal transition from peacekeeping and urgent humanitarian assistance to restarting the development process. We wish every success to this new body  which certainly gives rise to great hope throughout the world.  Before leaving the issue of peace and security  I must briefly mention two subjects that have a major  horizontal impact: terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.   With regard to the scourge of terrorism  concerted and decisive action at the international and region levels must obviously be taken. I am pleased that at the end of its sixtieth session  under the energetic presidency of Mr. Jan Eliasson  whom I congratulate for his work  the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). The Strategy must both address the conditions that encourage the spread of terrorism and seek to prevent and act against terrorism  including through the various bodies of the United Nations  while at the same time guaranteeing respect for human rights and the rule of law. As European Union ministers for foreign affairs declared a few days ago  that latter consideration applies in particular to the treatment of all detainees  as well as to the problematic issue of secret detention centres.   The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems continues to give rise to grave concern at the international level. The attitude and the activities of North Korea in the area of nuclear proliferation recently led the Security Council unanimously to adopt its resolution 1695 (2006).   Another subject of concern is Iran. In its resolution 1696 (2006)  the Security Council defined the main parameters which will guide the way in which the Iranian nuclear issue is approached by the international community and the European Union  which has been in discussion with Iran for more than two years. If those demands — particularly the suspension of all enrichment activity — are met  negotiations on a comprehensive agreement can begin and confidence can be restored.   The Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1) highlighted in particular the importance of development  which directly affects the fate of billions of human beings. While 2005 was the year of great development commitments  with the holding of the Group of Eight Summit at Gleneagles and the decision taken by the European Union — under the Luxembourg presidency — to meet the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income in official development assistance by 2015  2006 has been the year of implementation  particularly with the adoption of resolution 60/265  which reflects the international consensus in that area.  For its part  Luxembourg continues to be proud of its participation — still too limited unfortunately — in the 0.7 per cent club  with 0.82 per cent of its gross national income devoted to official development assistance in 2005. We hope to reach 1 per cent within the next few years.   The meeting held earlier this week to consider the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries showed once again that the establishment of a true development partnership remains a priority and urgent task. Unfortunately  that also remains true for international action against HIV/AIDS  which was the subject of a high-level meeting in June.   Concerned about improving the quality and effectiveness of aid to the most impoverished  my country looks forward with great interest to the proposals of the High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence which will be made public in the next few months. The maxim “development is the other name for peace” remains amazingly current.   In September 2005  the participants in the Summit formally recognized that development  peace  security and human rights are linked and mutually reinforcing. To strengthen the international framework for the promotion and protection of human rights  the General Assembly decided in March 2006  as we know  to replace the old Commission on Human Rights with a Human Rights Council. While the new Council’s first session enabled it to make some important progress in terms of standards  we must now bolster its establishment by providing it with all the means and instruments it needs — including special procedures —    06-53323 12  to promote the cause of human rights and to react swiftly and effectively to specific situations of serious human rights violations.   Likewise  we welcome the recent conclusion of the negotiations on a draft international convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. We hope that that important instrument can be adopted this fall by the General Assembly. Another significant innovation  adopted at last year’s Summit — the notion of the “responsibility to protect” in case of genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity — should be applied in accordance with the criteria and conditions defined in the Summit Outcome Document so that it can progressively become an undisputed standard to guide the action of the international community as the situation requires.   While peace and security  development and human rights are the three basic pillars on which the United Nations is based  those fundamental values can be fulfilled and fully expressed in real terms only through an effective and credible multilateral system. Multilateralism must not remain only a word. In the light of recent events in the Middle East  no nation  large or small  can escape the conclusion that multilateralism offers the only viable framework for finding solutions to the conflicts and threats that confront us.   It is our responsibility to provide the multilateral system with adequate means to carry out its principal missions. We must also ensure that the working methods and decision-making procedures of our bodies are defined and structured so that they can produce the best results and can best meet the legitimate expectations of Member States. Achieving a better cost-effectiveness ratio to benefit our peoples must be an objective of all Member States  large or small  of the North or the South. What is at stake is the credibility — perhaps even the survival — of multilateralism as a way to manage the major problems shared by humanity.  Some progress was made over the past year in reforming administrative and financial management  but much remains to be done. We must unite to bring about essential reform to transform the United Nations into an instrument fully capable of addressing the grave and multiple challenges at the beginning of the twenty-first century.  In that context  we cannot overlook the organ to which the Charter of the United Nations entrusts a vital role in the maintenance and preservation of international peace and security: the Security Council. For many years  ways and means to strengthen the legitimacy and effectiveness of that essential body were the subject of in-depth discussions  without any significant progress being made. For our part  we are convinced that Security Council reform remains indispensable. It must be carried out both to strengthen the Council’s representativity — by increasing the number of its permanent and non-permanent members  but without overburdening its functioning by granting the right of veto — and to improve its rules of procedure in order to enhance the effectiveness and transparency of its work and  thus  the legitimacy of its action.   I should like to conclude by referring to the person who has guided us and provided us with benchmarks as he has led the Organization for the past 10 years. I am  of course  speaking about our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. Although there is still some time before the end of his mandate — and I am sure that he intends to carry out a number of important missions before then — it is important that I now pay tribute to him and thank him for the work accomplished over the course of a lifetime devoted to serving the Organization.  The country that I have the honour to represent in this Hall  Luxembourg  also intends to be an important part of the life and the future of the Organization  which  more than 60 years after its establishment  continues to represent a noble ideal and hope for millions and millions of men and women. Luxembourg wants to put itself at the service of that ideal and of the international community and to shoulder its part of the responsibility in that regard. That is why  five years ago  we decided to submit our candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the biennium 2013-2014. Luxembourg  a founding Member of the United Nations that has not yet held a Council seat  views this candidacy as a new expression of its commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter  to peace and security  development and human rights and to an effective multilateral system.  Despite difficulties and obstacles  we must persevere  through dialogue and diplomacy  to fashion a United Nations worthy of our expectations. As we do so  let us be inspired by the reflection of the great   13 06-53323  Michelangelo  who said  “The greatest danger is not that our aim is too high and we miss it  but that it is too low and we reach it”. "
"105",4316,"LVA",61,2006,"I would like to begin by congratulating the Republic of Montenegro on its recent accession to the United Nations Organization. We fully understand the challenges that country faces and wish it every success in the establishment of a secure and prosperous State.  I wish to express our highest appreciation to the President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his enthusiastic dedication and skilful leadership during the past year. We now sincerely look forward to working with the President of the General Assembly at this session  Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa  and I pledge her Latvia’s full support. I also congratulate her on being only the third woman ever to preside over the General Assembly.  A year ago  we marked the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations by setting out a far-reaching reform plan to bring the Organization closer to the needs of the twenty-first century. While the United Nations spectrum of peacekeeping  humanitarian and human rights operations has increased significantly in recent years  the United Nations must continue to step up its activities if it is to meet the urgent needs of millions of people throughout the world.  The current situation presents us with great challenges at the global level that require us to act with urgency and coordination. We will be able to attain the Millennium Development Goals and reduce the crushing poverty that is debilitating the lives of billions of people across this planet only if we pool our resources and redouble our efforts. We need to pursue our campaign against well-known scourges that include    06-52737 24  contagious disease and the destruction of the global environment. (spoke in English)  We can take satisfaction in noting that a number of serious and meaningful measures have already been taken to alleviate the plight of the world’s poor. Those important steps must be followed up by continued measures to help the world’s poorest nations become more self-sufficient. At the same time  the developing countries must do their utmost to implement the practices of good governance  strengthen their institutions and abide by the rule of law.  It is worth emphasizing that the United Nations has been an effective instrument in those countries where the political will has existed to cooperate fully with the United Nations programmes and proposals for alleviating the plight of the poor. At the same time  the efficiency of United Nations operations has also been called into question  and not without reason. More innovative approaches need to be deployed for alleviating poverty and reaching set development objectives. Among those  we should look more to the effective use of information  communication and modern technologies.  I well remember the excitement at the Millennium Summit in 2000  when we adopted the Millennium Declaration. Progress towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals  alas  is still unacceptably slow. The statistics on infant mortality and maternal health  among others  remain particularly distressing. Millions of our fellow human beings have no access to clean drinking water  let alone more sophisticated comforts. We cannot remain indifferent when so much needs to be done.  In many parts of the world  the misery brought on by poverty is compounded by such debilitating and mortal diseases as HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria. While much has already been achieved to control the spread of those afflictions  further partnerships need to be developed with other stakeholders  including those in the private sector.  Only a few days ago  the States Members of the United Nations concluded a High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. The dramatic increase of illegal migration in recent years has placed great stress on the international system for protecting refugees and asylum-seekers. The activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on migration issues should be coordinated with regional cooperation efforts in order to become more effective.  We have had the great misfortune to see terrorism continue as a threat to international peace and security. I welcome  therefore  the recent agreement on a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and urge the United Nations Member States to intensify their efforts to reach a consensus on a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.  We have failed to make any substantial progress over the past year in the area of disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is a fundamental issue for global peace and security and I encourage all United Nations Member States to demonstrate their willingness to move forward at a faster pace.  The United Nations also needs to provide a prompt and effective response when armed conflicts arise. We must strive to make United Nations peacekeeping a more effective and accepted instrument of collective security. Too often in the past  the United Nations has been unable to prevent genocide and lasting bloodshed — in the Congo  in Rwanda  in the former Yugoslavia and now in the Darfur region of the Sudan. During the past 10 years  the operational activity of the United Nations in peacekeeping has quadrupled  but that may still not be enough. The demand for rapid action cannot be met through United Nations mechanisms alone  but requires a more effective partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations.  The most recent example of the need for a concerted peacekeeping effort is the tragic sequence of events in Israel and Lebanon this past summer. Peacekeeping can facilitate solutions  but not impose them. In Iraq and in Afghanistan  as well as in the continuing conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians  there will be no durable peace until all parties renounce the use of violence to achieve political aims. A long-lasting settlement requires the political will of all parties in the region to negotiate a viable compromise in good faith  where a secure State of Israel coexists side by side with an independent State of Palestine.  Currently  the United Nations is uniquely positioned to take a leading role in peacebuilding. We   25 06-52737  expect the recently established Peacebuilding Commission to help those countries that are emerging from conflict not to be drawn back into it  and hope that the Commission will serve to promote the post-conflict reconstruction and long-term development of regions that have suffered from warfare.  Along with the promotion of peace and security and the alleviation of poverty  the protection of human rights is one of the main missions of the United Nations. The recent creation of the Human Rights Council will hopefully enable the United Nations to respond more promptly and effectively in situations where human rights come under threat. The Council needs to provide real leadership to restore trust in the United Nations as a guardian  defender and promoter of that universal value.  However  the effectiveness of the Human Rights Council depends entirely on the political will and conduct of the Member States. We must work together to ensure that this new institution  in which we have placed such high hopes  truly serves the purpose for which it was created.  During this session  we will face the difficult task of furthering the reform of the United Nations. We have to accept the fact that none of the United Nations Member States will be able to attain absolutely everything they desire from the reform process. At no point should any Members think of negotiations for these necessary reforms as a zero-sum game in which some will be losers and some winners. It is possible to arrive at solutions that constitute a win-win situation for everybody. It takes hard work and a lot of patience  but it can be done.  It is natural for different countries to have different priorities and different threat perceptions. That is a fact of life. It is precisely for that reason that we need the United Nations as a central meeting place where our common interests can be determined and our common plans hammered out in an inclusive and democratic manner. The ongoing reforms of the United Nations are needed for the benefit and advantage of us all  without exception.  The international agreements that are reached within the United Nations bear a unique legitimacy  moral weight and political authority. Yet it is no secret that in an Organization with nearly 200 Members  the decision-making process can be protracted. Nevertheless  despite the painstakingly slow pace of United Nations reform to date  there has been some notable progress during the past year. It is vital for the United Nations to continue striving for more trust and goodwill among all our nations  for we simply cannot afford to do otherwise.  There is general agreement that the time has come for a serious overhaul of the United Nations management system. An effective Secretariat is crucial for the United Nations system’s ability to adapt to evolving challenges. So far  only the initial steps have been taken in transforming the United Nations into a more efficient and accountable Organization. The time has come for meaningful changes  and I hope that we will establish tangible results during this sixty-first session.  Mandate review is another essential element of the reform process where our aspirations have been higher than the result achieved. Only a fraction of the numerous mandates have been classified and the question of what to do with them is still pending. We need to move ahead energetically  bearing in mind that this is not a blind cost-cutting exercise but an ongoing process of feedback needed to improve the effectiveness and quality of the Organization’s work. Rational use of resources and cost-efficiency will allow us to do more with the resources at the command of the United Nations  without any duplication of effort.  There has been a growing feeling among United Nations Member States of the need for a revitalized and more effective General Assembly. I welcome the regular meetings among the Presidents of the General Assembly  the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council with the aim of achieving maximum complementarity among those principal organs. The Charter of the United Nations provides us with the fundamental guidelines for our work  and we should be guided by it in a spirit of cooperation  not rivalry. It is self-defeating  unproductive and wasteful to invest time and effort in a competition among the main bodies of the United Nations. Only by rising above such internal divisions can the United Nations hope to truly fulfil the leading role that it has to play in order to serve the needs of the world community as a whole.  We must also not neglect the reform of the Security Council  which needs to be more representative of the state of the world in 2006. While this matter should not overshadow the rest of the reform process  neither can it be indefinitely    06-52737 26  postponed. Progress on this issue needs to be made  for it would invigorate and give added impetus to the overall reform process. The Security Council has a central role to play in maintaining international peace and security. If it is to function as a truly effective organ  then it must attain both a stronger capacity and a greater willingness to act in the face of international crises and tensions and it must find ways of responding more rapidly at the outbreak of armed conflicts.  At this sixty-first session of the General Assembly  we must make every effort to make progress in adjusting the United Nations to the needs and challenges of our times. This session will be the last under the stewardship of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. During his mandate  Mr. Annan has exhibited outstanding leadership in setting the agenda and establishing a clear vision of the goals of the United Nations. I therefore take this opportunity to thank him for his tireless dedication to the United Nations and for framing and initiating the much-needed reform process. His successor will inherit a vast and complex agenda which can only be tackled with maximum cooperation and flexibility from all Member States.  The United Nations requires a Secretary-General who will be willing to listen to and to respect the views of all  but who will also have the personal courage to push for the necessary  but possibly unpopular  decisions that are needed for the good of the Organization as a whole. A Secretary-General must be endowed with leadership  vision  fairness and objectivity. He or she must be a true citizen of the world who can feel the pulse of humanity. He or she must have the passion and commitment to spare no effort in facing up to the most demanding of challenges.  Today  the United Nations is at a crossroads and faces a choice: to address the challenges of the twenty-first century through the combined efforts of all its Member States  or to gradually lose its influence in the international community.  As many here are aware  I recently announced my decision to submit my candidacy for the position of Secretary-General. I highly appreciate the confidence placed in me by the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  when he appointed me Special Envoy on United Nations Reform. I am personally committed to addressing the challenges posed by United Nations reform and to promoting human rights  freedom and democracy  including gender equality. While women represent half of the world’s population  no woman has ever been at the helm of this Organization. I believe that the time has come for a woman to be considered a serious candidate for the position of Secretary-General.  It so happens that  as a result of historical events in the twentieth century  no Secretary-General has ever come from Eastern Europe. Yet that region has a wealth of experience to share about its ability to effect radical change and achieve progress in a remarkably brief period of time.  Nevertheless  the principle of regional rotation should not be the principal or sole factor in the selection of a candidate. While I deeply respect the candidates who have already been nominated from one part of the world  the selection procedure should not restrict the rights and opportunities of potential candidates from any other part of the world. I hope that the choice made by the Security Council and the General Assembly will be based solely on the candidate’s qualifications  personal qualities and vision.  The world needs a strong United Nations  and we as leaders need to build bridges of understanding if we are to make the United Nations as strong as it needs to be. We need to keep alive the main goal of the founders of the United Nations  who were determined “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. We owe it to our children  who will inherit this planet  to save them also from the scourges of terrorism  of hunger and of disease.  Because of my own personal experience as a child of war and a refugee  having known fear  cold  loss and hunger in my time  I urge world leaders to save every child that we can from such experiences. Our common goal is to extend worldwide the peace  freedom and prosperity that so many nations have already achieved. It can be done; it must be done. But it is something that we can achieve only by all of us working together. "
"106",4363,"MAR",61,2006,"Madam President  I would like at the outset to extend my sincere congratulations to you and the brother country of the Kingdom of Bahrain on your election as the first Arab woman in the history of the United Nations to preside over the General Assembly. I wish you every success in your tasks during this session and in realizing our aspirations  and achieving practical and valuable results regarding items on the agenda.  I would like to avail myself of this occasion to express my warm thanks to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his brilliant presidency of last year’s session.  Allow me also to seize this opportunity to reiterate Morocco’s appreciation of Mr. Kofi Annan for the noble tasks he has been undertaking and for his tireless efforts throughout his term to consolidate our Organization’s international position and to revitalize its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. We equally appreciate his unfailing support for regional and international development activities to ensure the promotion of the United Nations mechanisms and structures and thus reinforce their effectiveness.  The Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the accession of the Republic of Montenegro to membership of the United Nations and we assure it of our constructive and continuous cooperation.  This year’s session coincides with the 50th anniversary of Morocco’s joining the United Nations. They have been 50 years of clear and concrete commitment to the purposes and principles of our Organization aimed at fostering peace and security worldwide and at consolidating development for the benefit of all peoples and States  mainly in developing countries.  Joining the United Nations was one of the first sovereign decisions Morocco made in the wake of gaining its independence. It expressed the Kingdom’s firm belief in the efficacy of multilateral action as one of the most viable means of managing chronic crises and as an appropriate tool to face growing international challenges. It also reflects Morocco’s unfailing commitment to the values of active solidarity and fruitful cooperation  as expressed in a speech given by the late King Mohammed V on 6 November 1956  when he stated that   “Morocco’s attachment to the principles underpinning the United Nations reflects its commitment to supporting freedom and peace throughout the world and to establishing international relations on the basis of arbitration and concord  with no recourse whatsoever to violence or force  and relying on cooperation and solidarity rather than on animosity and discrimination”.  Since joining the United Nations  the Kingdom of Morocco has endeavoured to contribute significantly to helping our Organization attain its status as a central actor in the establishment of international peace and security  as well as in organizing and promoting international relations to create a world order built on cooperation  justice and international legality. The Kingdom has always been an advocate of the principles of international law  United Nations resolutions and multilateral actions emanating from constructive dialogue and ongoing consultations as the most viable way to settle international conflicts and crises peacefully.    06-53323 46   Throughout that period  the Kingdom has contributed to numerous United Nations peacekeeping operations in demonstration of its commitment to international peace and of its deeply rooted belief in the importance of collective security and of the role of the United Nations in that field. Today  our country is contributing to five peacekeeping operations in Africa  the Caribbean and Europe. That has earned Morocco the thirteenth position among countries contributing to peacekeeping operations internationally  the second at the Arab level and the sixth at the African level.  In addition  the Kingdom of Morocco has launched a process aimed at establishing active solidarity among members of the international community through constructive and fruitful partnerships between North and South  on the one hand  and the reinforcement of South-South cooperation as a strategic priority  on the other  in order to achieve sustainable and balanced development for the benefit of all.  The Kingdom of Morocco has further endeavoured to implement the recommendations adopted at important United Nations meetings and conferences on development issues  including the Millennium Development Goals  which are in full harmony with our national development strategy. In that regard  the National Initiative for Human Development  launched by His Majesty King Mohammed VI on 18 May 2005  testifies to Morocco’s willingness to lay the foundations for a development model that embodies Morocco’s political choices and is helping to establish a modern and democratic society. Modernization  democratization and economic development  as well as sustained human development indicators  are interdependent in the quest for equitable opportunities  the dissemination of knowledge and the provision of basic social services.  Our development initiative places a special emphasis on the empowerment of the Moroccan citizen as the focus of comprehensive development  in line with the Secretary-General’s report of 2005  entitled “In larger freedom: towards development  security and human rights for all”.  In that context  and in a spirit guided by universal principles aimed at creating the necessary harmony between Morocco’s international commitments and its national priorities  a workshop on the promotion of human rights was convened in Morocco. The workshop was marked by the issuance of specific recommendations upon the end of the mandate of our equity and reconciliation commission  in a critical and transparent evaluation of a specific period of Morocco’s past with a sense of responsibility and a constructive vision of its future.  Since its inception  the United Nations has contributed to the settlement of many international disputes and the establishment of peace and security in many regions. However  the Middle East and Africa still suffer from many conflicts  wars and economic and social crises that thwart peoples’ natural aspirations to security  stability and development.  In that regard  and having welcomed the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza as a first step towards the establishment of a Palestinian State in accordance with the road map  Morocco hopes that the current dire situation  which has led to even more killing and destruction  will rapidly come to an end. Following the failure of various international and regional efforts to resume the peace process and settle the Arab-Israeli conflict  the Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its call on the international community  and the Security Council in particular  to assume their responsibilities in the search for a comprehensive and lasting solution to the conflict  in accordance with the terms of reference of the peace process  relevant United Nations resolutions and international legality  as well as the principle of land for peace.  Concerning the military aggression against brotherly Lebanon and the resultant loss of civilian life and destruction of infrastructure and service facilities  Morocco welcomed Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and expresses its hope that all concerned parties will cooperate in providing the appropriate political conditions for a lasting settlement on the basis of the Taif agreement and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Morocco also calls upon the international community to provide more cooperation and solidarity in the reconstruction of Lebanon and to support the success of efforts to achieve peace and tranquillity for our brother Lebanese.   As for the situation in the brotherly country of Iraq  Morocco acknowledges the outcome of the political process  in which all Iraqi parties and influential political actors took part. However  Morocco is still hoping for an end to the ongoing violence  which continues to bring suffering to   47 06-53323  innocent Iraqi civilians. We hope that our Iraqi brothers can agree  as soon as possible  on the time and venue for a conference on Iraqi national accord  which could help establish a basis for the completion of institutional reforms thereby ensuring the sovereignty  territorial integrity  security and stability of a unified and safe Iraq.  The Kingdom of Morocco  whose head of State  His Majesty King Mohammed VI  chairs the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  reaffirms its commitment to work together with all parties towards a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The achievement of that objective will depend on the Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories and the establishment of a Palestinian State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital  living side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel.  Morocco firmly believes in dialogue and negotiations as a means of settling regional and international disputes. It also considers that resorting to force  whatever the reason or motives  will not yield viable solutions or lead to a just  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. On the contrary  it will only exacerbate and prolong the status quo.  Morocco is equally convinced that peace in the region can be achieved only if the United Nations creates the right environment and works to eradicate the causes of tension and escalation and coordinates regional and international efforts aimed at reviving the peace process on all tracks  with a view to ultimately achieving security and lasting peace. In that way  the peoples of the region would be able to move towards a more promising future in which generations to come can cooperate and live together in harmony.  The African continent is facing a number of serious threats and major challenges. It is currently beset by many crises and conflicts that have proved difficult to resolve. Indeed  half of the armed conflicts in the world over the past decade have taken place in Africa  which also hosts half of the world’s refugees. The continent is also confronted by numerous economic and social problems  including poverty  hunger  desertification and infectious diseases  which threaten the daily lives of millions of people.  This critical situation  which should by no means be considered inevitable  making Africa a priority for the United Nations and for international development programmes and agendas. However  programmes and initiatives must be better harmonized and coordinated if they are to create conditions conducive to sustainable development in Africa. To that end  we must consider creating an international mechanism that includes experts in the fields of security and development to supervise the implementation of the range of international programmes and initiatives concerning Africa.  For its part  the Kingdom of Morocco will continue to support all development efforts in Africa. His Majesty King Mohammed VI  a champion of peace and development whose enlightened and far-sighted vision is based on a full and deep understanding of the concerns of the continent  has introduced many initiatives and visited many African countries with the aim of strengthening the bonds of brotherhood  cooperation and solidarity among African peoples.  In this regard  Morocco calls for the holding next year of a high-level dialogue on Africa and development with a view to further intensifying the development debate and consultation and establishing mechanisms to guarantee the implementation of all international initiatives aimed at making full use of the continent’s huge economic and human potential in the service of its development.  In his first address to the General Assembly  His Majesty the late King Mohammed V declared that the Kingdom of Morocco had chosen negotiation as the basis for its international relations  with a view to reaching mutual agreements  freely arrived at  and providing for peace  unity and solidarity among nations. In keeping with that broad vision  the Kingdom of Morocco has renewed its commitment to cooperate with the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy in order to find a lasting  negotiated and mutually acceptable political solution to the dispute over the Moroccan Sahara.  In this respect  and in response to the call of the Security Council to break the current deadlock and make progress towards a political  consensus-based and final solution to the dispute  Morocco will present an autonomy plan that would enable the inhabitants of the region to manage their local affairs within the framework of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco.    06-53323 48   To that end  nationwide consultations were launched in November 2005 with all political actors and local representatives of the region  within the framework of the Royal Consultative Council for Saharan Affairs  whose membership has been renewed  structure modernized and mandate strengthened. This process has been carried out on the basis of participation and transparency aimed at encouraging the adherence of all parties to the notion of autonomy. This experience is unique in the Arab North African region.  More than ever  the world needs a more efficient United Nations that can translate into reality the aspirations and expectations of all the peoples of the world  uphold the principles of international legality and foster the spirit of multilateralism through innovative mechanisms  value-added components and new ideas that can yield positive results.  As it has done over the past 50 years  the Kingdom of Morocco will contribute to strengthening the principles of the Organization and enhancing its work in the service of peace  development and accord among all peoples of the world.

"107",4387,"MCO",61,2006,"Few women before you  Madam  have been elected to the presidency of the General Assembly  despite the fact that  as the Chinese proverb states  women hold up half the sky. We are delighted by your election and congratulate you and your country  Bahrain. Our congratulations go also to the Group of Asian States  which  happily  put your name forward. You can rest assured that our delegation will always be ready to support you as you carry out you lofty and challenging task.  We would also like to congratulate your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  on having so successfully guided the work of the General Assembly during the previous session  as well as for his understanding of the capacity of Member States to overcome their differences. Because of his perseverance  the majority of the reforms resulting from the commitments entered into at the 2005 World Summit have been implemented.  At the beginning of this debate we heard Mr. Kofi Annan present his report on the work of the Organization (A/61/1) for the last time. He clearly set out for us his beliefs and accomplishments and his recommendations for strengthening the United Nations. My delegation associates itself with the numerous tributes paid to the Secretary-General. We also wish to convey to him our profound gratitude for his courageous efforts over the past 10 years. Thanks to the extensive experience he acquired at the Organization  he was able to move the United Nations forward — in an environment fraught with threats and new challenges — to meet the expectations aroused as a result of the upheavals caused by globalization. His clear vision made it possible to establish the existence of the nexus between peace  development and human rights — Charter principles that have repeatedly underpinned our common efforts.   Guided by the watchful motivation of His Serene Highness Prince Albert II  the Government of Monaco has worked to increase its contribution to development and international cooperation through a significant increase in official development assistance (ODA). In that connection  cooperation credits have increased by 30 per cent in 2006. The Principality will continue its efforts to expeditiously reach the goals set and reaffirmed last year at this very rostrum by His Serene Highness the Sovereign Prince.   The advancement of women  improving child and maternal health and the alleviation of poverty are among the Principality’s priorities on the international sphere. The Sovereign Prince and his sisters  Princess Caroline of Hanover and Princess Stéphanie of    06-53958 2  Monaco  are greatly involved in development efforts intended to help the most destitute. In her capacity as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Educational  Scientific and Cultural Organization  Her Royal Highness the Princess of Hanover is helping to promote programmes to educate girls and women. Part of that effort includes a project undertaken by Monaco  Andorra  Cyprus  Luxembourg and San Marino on the theme of human rights and education in combating poverty and promoting the independence of girls and women.  As President of the World Association of Children’s Friends  the Princess has long led an ongoing struggle to protect children. On the recent occasion of being honoured by UNICEF-USA  the Princess of Hanover stated that “today we are at war against terror  especially against the terror in the eyes  hearts and spirits of millions of children around the world”.  This session will provide impetus to the effort to promote and protect the rights of children with next October’s publication of a study by the independent expert Paulo Pinheiro  to which the Principality is proud to have contributed. Let us not forget that  as Jean-Paul Sartre wrote  violence  regardless of what form it takes  constitutes a failure.   We hope that  following the Security Council’s debates on the protection of children in armed conflict  the effective implementation of Council resolution 1620 (2005) will lead to progress in this area of such concern. It is unacceptable in human terms for the perpetrators of such crimes to go unpunished.   During her presence here last June to attend the High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS  Princess Stéphanie of Monaco expressed her solidarity with all those fighting the disease or otherwise affected. Through her Fight AIDS Monaco association  the Princess is working to promote prevention  research and assistance to those affected by the virus — especially sero-positive people  who are often victims of discrimination. In that regard  the Princess has expressed the wish that the dignity of every sero-positive person be respected. Her association will support the establishment of an entity to provide psychological support for those ill with the disease in an African country where many non-governmental organizations from Monaco have already carried out development efforts.   The upcoming appointment of Princess Stéphanie as a special representative of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) will further strengthen her commitment to the fight against this terrible pandemic  which is increasingly affecting more and more women. To address that situation  the Government of Monaco has decided that  in addition to the support it provides to UNAIDS  it will begin this year to finance a United Nations Population Fund project in Africa focusing mainly on sero-positive women suffering from extreme poverty and psychological distress and providing them with medical  psychological and social assistance.   Our heads of State or Government resolved to take action when they accepted the responsibility to protect. It is of course up to individual States to protect their populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. But when such tragic events cannot be prevented  it falls to the international community  working through the United Nations  to be prepared to immediately provide assistance to victims of such acts.   Whether a catastrophe is natural or man-made  it is crucial that we be able to meet the most pressing needs of civilian populations. In that regard  we would like to commend the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator and his Office for their ongoing efforts  especially as regards the restructuring of the Central Emergency Response Fund. Monaco is a contributor to the Fund and intends to continue its efforts to provide financing for humanitarian assistance during the years to come.   Before the end of this year  His Serene Highness Prince Albert II will once again visit the fishing village of Sirombu on Nias Island  Indonesia  which has twice been struck by natural disaster: first by a tidal wave in December 2004 and  a few months later  by an earthquake. The village has been rebuilt thanks to the effective and generous action of the Monaco-Asia Association.   As the Sovereign Prince announced that it would during the 2005 World Summit (see A/60/PV./6)  Monaco ratified the Kyoto Protocol last February.   Our head of State has a personal and ongoing commitment to protecting the environment. That commitment was recently evidenced in the polar expedition he undertook 100 years after the one made   3 06-53958  by his great-great grandfather  Prince Albert I  a pioneer of modern oceanography. Having reached the North Pole with his team on 16 April 2006  following four days on an arduous course on dog sleds from the Russian base of Barneo  Prince Albert II launched an urgent appeal regarding the dangers of global warming  unfortunately in evidence in the Arctic in the significant shrinking of the ice shelf. Back in Monaco  His Serene Highness established a foundation devoted to environmental preservation and sustainable development that will serve as a permanent source of dynamic and innovative efforts in the areas of climate change  biodiversity loss and water resources.  The Principality is also pleased to have been elected to the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. We hope to contribute to improving the United Nations environmental machinery.  The Principality of Monaco believes that there is a need to establish and strengthen dialogue among civilizations in order to prevent conflict. We support all efforts aimed at actively promoting a culture of peace and mutual respect among the world’s various creeds  cultures and languages. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated in 1999  “The greater the appreciation of diversity  the deeper the sense of identity and the sounder the enlargement of the common denominator of values” (A/54/546  para. 13).  It is in that spirit that Monaco  aware of the universal value of sport as one of the best tools to establish inter-cultural dialogue  fully supports the United Nations Action Plan on Sport for Development and Peace.

"108",4412,"MDA",61,2006,"At the outset allow me to congratulate you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session and to wish you every success in this very honourable and responsible position. My commendation also goes to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson.   I should also like to express my deepest appreciation and praise to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the commitment and determination he has shown in discharging his important duties. Concerning the forthcoming elections for the new Secretary-General  I take this opportunity to recall that eastern Europe is the only region that has not been represented in this high position. In this regard  we welcome the candidature of Mrs. Vaira Vike-Freiberga  President of the Republic of Latvia.  The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 still loom large in our memory. The fifth anniversary of this tragedy has again filled our television screens with horrific scenes of suffering and death. It has served to remind us of the resolve that is necessary to combat terrorism  which constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.  With this in mind  Moldova fully supports the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted recently by the General Assembly  and welcomes the Assembly’s decision to continue  during the current session  consideration of the Secretary-General’s progress report on the prevention of armed conflict (A/60/891). We consider that the specific measures in the Strategy’s plan of action are comprehensive in their details and far-reaching in their insight. We need to take practical steps individually and collectively to implement the provisions of the plan. Likewise  we believe that the recommendations outlined in the Secretary-General’s progress report will serve as guiding points for Member States in preventing conflicts throughout the world.  Many regional organizations have been entrusted by the United Nations  under the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter  with dealing with a number of conflicts that are not in the focus of the Security Council. We need a more systematic outreach to these regional organizations. No conflict in the world should escape the attention of the United Nations  whether or not it is on the Security Council’s agenda.  From this perspective  we are delighted that the General Assembly  despite opposition from some Member States  agreed to include in the agenda of this session a new item  item 27  proposed by Azerbaijan  Georgia  Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova —    06-53609 2  GUAM: “Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace  security and development”. These unresolved conflicts continue to impact negatively on the political  social and economic development of the GUAM States and the millions of people living in the region. We believe that bringing the matter to the international community through the General Assembly will facilitate the resolution of conflicts in Azerbaijan  Georgia and the Republic of Moldova  and will not  as some fear  undermine the existing mechanisms to negotiate settlement of these conflicts. In this context  I should like to express on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Moldova deep gratitude to those countries that have supported our initiative.  The Transdniestrian conflict is first and foremost a product of geopolitical interests and designs. It was unleashed with external support immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the declaration of independence and sovereignty by the Republic of Moldova. Unlike other internal conflicts generated and fostered by ethnic and religious antagonisms  it has a purely political character. The similarity of the ethnic structure of the population on both sides of the Dniestr river speaks for itself in this regard and cannot be denied.   Over the years the Moldovan authorities have put in place specific policies aimed at ensuring full respect for the human rights of ethnic minorities  in accordance with the highest international standards. International organizations dealing with human rights issues have repeatedly attested that in the Republic of Moldova all the conditions for the preservation of the cultural and linguistic identities of ethnic minorities have been created. These conditions include the functioning of many schools based on the languages of minorities  as well as the broad use of Russian as the language of inter-ethnic communication.  The satisfactory resolution of the Gagauz issue by granting special status to the region concerned is one of the greatest achievements of Moldova’s national policy. It offers a unique example in post-cold-war Europe of an internal conflict settled successfully by political means. These developments  against the backdrop of the lack of democracy and growing criticism by the international community of the totalitarian Transdniestrian regime of Tiraspol  have convinced the separatist leaders to cease the political exploitation of cultural and linguistic factors within the negotiation process.  It should be emphasized here that the territory controlled by the separatists is one of the few regions of its kind in the world  one where political parties and non-governmental organizations opposed to the separatist regime are prohibited; where freedom of the mass media and of opinion is non-existent; and where other fundamental freedoms  especially those of the native Moldovan population  are systematically violated.  Moreover  various types of conventional weapons  including those prohibited or restricted by the relevant international arms control regimes  continue to be manufactured illegally in the region. The process of military build-up in Transdniestria is conducted vigorously by the separatist leaders  despite steady efforts by Moldova to reduce its military forces and to settle the political conflict exclusively through peaceful means  without giving up its status of permanent neutrality.  The Moldovan authorities are determined to find a political solution to the Transdniestrian conflict based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. This regional security problem should be resolved through negotiations  with the participation of key actors in the “5+2” format. The end goal of negotiations should be the drafting of a special legal status for the Transdniestrian region within the Republic of Moldova. The region’s democratization and demilitarization are indispensable conditions for progress in the settlement process.  We have a sound road map for settling the conflict  the Ukrainian plan  together with the documents approved by the Moldovan Parliament in the summer of 2005. It is important that the negotiations resume as soon as possible  without any preconditions. The calls for such negotiations are strongly supported by the Republic of Moldova. Although little progress was achieved in the four rounds of the “5+2” negotiations  we believe it is crucial to hold talks rather than to preserve the status quo.  With a view to advancing the settlement process  the Moldovan authorities have taken a number of complementary actions. Thus  on 22 July 2005  the Moldovan Parliament adopted the Law on Fundamental Regulations of the Special Legal Status of Settlements   3 06-53609  on the Left Bank of the River Nistru. This law grants Transdniestria the right to solve  independently  problems related to legal  social and economic development  while complying with the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Moldova. Moreover  the law grants the Transdniestrian region the right to have its own legislative and executive bodies  as well as more official languages.  In the same vein  conditions have been created to bring the activities of Transdniestrian companies within the legal framework of the country through their registration with the relevant constitutional authorities  which should allow those companies to benefit fully from the trade preferences Moldova has with its partners  including the European Union. That has been possible due to a joint commitment of the Moldovan and Ukrainian authorities to secure our common border. The deployment on the ground of the European Union Border Assistance Mission facilitated cooperation between the relevant Moldovan and Ukrainian services aimed at establishing a single customs regime and efficiently controlling the frontier. We are confident that this trilateral interaction will contribute to settling the Transdniestrian problem.  We take this opportunity to inform the Assembly that on 17 September the separatist Transdniestrian regime held a so-called referendum on the region’s future. We condemn this pseudo-referendum  which flagrantly infringes the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova  undermines the country’s territorial integrity and defies democratic values and standards. The Republic of Moldova is grateful to the mediators and observers of the negotiation process — the European Union  the United States of America  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Ukraine — for their resolute position on non-recognition of that farce.  We continue to be concerned about the tensions in the security zone. The inefficiency of the current peacekeeping mechanism dictates the need for its transformation into a multinational peacekeeping mission with an international mandate. We welcome certain proposals made in this sense  and are ready to tackle this issue  in a result-oriented manner  without delay. With regard to the military aspect  I should reiterate our concern and deep regret that the Russian Federation has not yet fulfilled its Istanbul commitments. The complete implementation of these decisions will facilitate the process for the entering into force of the adapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. We also underline the need for an early international inspection of depots with ammunition in the Transdniestrian region. Monitoring of the military-industrial enterprises in the eastern region of the Republic of Moldova is long overdue.  This year the Republic of Moldova celebrates the fifteenth anniversary of its independence. During these 15 years  as a Member State of the United Nations  we have fully shared the common values  responsibilities  achievements and setbacks of the Organization. Nevertheless  we laid the foundations for a democratic society where basic human rights and the rights of national minorities are fully respected. The main achievement has been the consolidation of the Republic of Moldova as a peace-loving  independent European country. The Republic of Moldova has irreversibly chosen the way of European integration as a strategic objective of its foreign policy. We are fully committed to the idea of integrating into the system of political  economic and social values of the European Union’s family. We hope that the successful implementation of the European Union-Moldova Action Plan will open up for us the possibility of elevating contractual relations with the European Union to a new level.  In conclusion  I voice our hope that the proceedings of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session will be conducted in a spirit of solidarity and with a realistic and constructive approach to the complex issues confronting the world today. The delegation of the Republic of Moldova is committed to contributing  alongside other Member States  to the fulfilment of the lofty goals of the United Nations. "
"109",4456,"MDG",61,2006,"I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for everything that he has done; he has been a great Secretary-General. Thanks to his clear vision  his commitment and his open-mindedness  he has greatly contributed to the development of the United Nations and the promotion of Africa. I thank him and his team.  Last year we discussed the Millennium Development Goals. It was clear that they could not be attained in the sub-Saharan countries if we did not make a considerable effort. The initiatives of the G-8  the World Bank  the European Union and other donors seemed to constitute a good foundation for a profound change. Have we noticed a profound change? I do not think so. The sad reality is that Africa receives less international assistance per capita than it did 20 years ago.  Let us be honest. The great ideas and the goodwill expressed in words rarely pass through the filters of existing structures and programmes. The files on Afghanistan  Iraq and Lebanon  the Palestine question and the oil question have put the Africa file in the shade. It is a fact: Africa is not a priority for international authorities.  However  I remind the Assembly that we all set the Millennium Development Goals. These are common goals; therefore  their realization is also a common task. I remind the Assembly  too  that when we deal with issues we are also writing the destiny of hundreds of millions of human beings. Our decisions affect millions of children. Where is the fervent desire  then  to deliver on what we have promised to do for them? That is the paradox between what we preach and what we do.  I remind the Assembly that the task of this community is to avoid crises instead of dealing with crises. This institution should be a place not for firefighters  but for strategists.   I emphasize that the idea of one world  the foundation of globalization  cannot take us towards a fair and peaceful future as long as many poor countries are still marginalized. We want the same ticket to enter the international community as the European Union has given to Eastern European countries. We should all be on the same boat. However  many developing countries are still struggling behind it  swimming hard to try to catch up with it. How can we get out of this calamitous situation?  The Millennium Development Goals must remain the basis of our discussions and our actions  even if their achievement becomes more and more difficult. The industrialized countries have asked us  the   19 06-52988  developing countries  to develop visions for our countries and to prepare road maps in order to achieve them. They have asked us to specify the Millennium Development Goals for our countries. They have asked us to increase our absorption capacity.  All of that is fair and understandable. However  the role of industrialized countries is not to play the referee  assess players and give out red cards. All countries  developed and developing alike  must play together. We must act together and have the same goal.  That is why I have decided to develop a new strategy in Madagascar  which we call the Madagascar Action Plan. The plan has been discussed throughout the regions of Madagascar with representatives of private and public organizations to create a sound basis for achieving our vision  “Madagascar — Naturally!”  and the Millennium Development Goals.  The plan has also been discussed with members of the donor community. I told them that it is based on our vision and on the Millennium Development Goals  which we all set together. We should not be satisfied with existing means; we should mobilize all the means needed to achieve those goals.  I also told the donors that the Madagascar Action Plan is our common plan. We decide together how many men and women we want to — and can — pull out of poverty; how many poor children can have a better education; and how many children we can save by providing them with safe drinking water and vaccines.  Together we have to answer these questions  because they concern global tasks  common tasks. Hunger  poverty and disasters are among those issues that know no borders. Therefore  they are part of our shared responsibility.   We must change the approach used in the past  which was based on division. We must accept that the tasks are too burdensome to be carried out by weak people  to whom a new burden is given. I am talking about goals and measures that we must deal with together  according to the capacity of each of us.  International assistance for African development must undoubtedly be doubled or tripled in the short term. Donors must deliver on their promises in the short term if we really want to revive the economies of African countries.  People ask why sub-Saharan Africa has not experienced economic growth in the last few years. There are many reasons. They include internal conflicts  lack of good governance  instability and insecurity. However  the reduction of aid per capita during the last 20 years is one of the main reasons for the slowing of economic growth.  A further reduction of international aid has been proposed  so that developing countries will become — so it is said — much more independent quickly. That is a fundamental misunderstanding. To become independent  we need more international aid. Greater support is the shortest path towards independence. The more we invest in education  infrastructure and health  the more economic growth will be strengthened. And the more economic growth is strengthened  the quicker will the independence of developing countries become effective.  Investments in education  health  infrastructure and so on continue to be conditions for foreign direct investment. Private investment cannot replace them.   We should look at the results of the Marshall Plan and at the huge investments by the European Union in the new member States. They have been a huge success.  The question of absorption capacity has been discussed. Like all developing countries  we too have had problems  problems of cooperation between national and international partners. Basically  if there is a lack of capacity  it is the result of lack of cooperation and confidence.   Capacity must never be the factor that determines the volume of support. Where there is a lack of capacity in an area  it is necessary to strengthen that area. If there are not yet enough human resources available at the national level  it is necessary to call on international experts  while reinforcing national capacities.  In this context  I would like to add a few words on “country ownership”. It is true that we in the developing countries know our problems very well. Therefore  we are ready to assume our responsibilities. Deciding on policies and actions must be the responsibility of nationals. The programmes of the donors have to be integrated into national programmes.  But it is also true that we are not always aware of our weaknesses and are not in phase with all the    06-52988 20  values  rules  standards and procedures that are acknowledged in most industrialized countries. Often our fellow citizens do not appreciate the true worth of good governance.  Transferring the rules of good governance and standards of quality in education  health and infrastructure into our culture and our policies is essential. The transfer of knowledge is as urgent as is the transfer of capital. It is not only technical knowledge that we lack; the transfer of knowledge must also include values and the concept of professionalism.  Let us pool our capacities. What is at stake is so important that we must use all our capacities at the same time. Effectiveness must be the rule. Good cooperation between national and international experts is the basis of success.  And let us be more realistic  more pragmatic. The percentage of international aid spent on studies is far too high. Most studies are not implemented and simply repeat what previous studies have already found out.  I also recommend more effective decentralization  so that financial aid reaches the grass-roots communities. The financing mechanism is often slow and sometimes complex. It resembles a tortuous  stony path — and it is porous.   From time to time  we ask the same questions: How can we better structure international assistance? Which transfer of funds  for which area and with which measures is the most important? There is no simple answer. Each country  each region and each area requires a different answer. Theoretical discussions will not help.   However  there is a foundation that is crucial to all development: confidence. If a people do not feel confident  they will not contribute to development. If international firms do not feel confident  they will not come.  Confidence comes from opening up to the outside world  from stability  security and transparency. Good governance and democracy are also crucial. I assure the Assembly that Madagascar  my Government and I  will hold free and fair presidential elections in December.  During last year’s session of the Assembly there was general agreement about the urgent need to increase international aid quantitatively and qualitatively in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We should therefore act accordingly.   North America  Europe and most countries in Asia and South America have experienced an era of prosperity and progress. Their peoples now have a good chance of enjoying a good standard of living until the age of 80.  The peoples of Africa do not have that chance. I therefore call upon the United Nations to develop and adopt a new  more dynamic and determined approach in favour of Africa. If that is done  opportunities will be more balanced and the world will be a fairer place.  We note that the industrialized countries can react quickly and launch large-scale operations if their vital interests are at stake. We desire now the same dynamic approach for Africa  because the basic needs of our people are still being ignored. Such an approach is in the interest of the African peoples  but it is also in the best interest of humanity. A prosperous Africa is an asset for the world. "
"110",4495,"MDV",61,2006,"The United Nations today is at a crossroads. It needs to become part of the twenty-first century  and it must do so with great urgency. It needs to gear itself to become an institution capable of taking on the serious challenges that confront the international community.  As we address these tasks  your election  Madam President  to preside over the sixty-first session of the General Assembly is a tribute to your wisdom and skill. It is also a compliment to your great country. I take this opportunity to congratulate you. At the same time  it gives me pleasure to express appreciation to Mr. Jan Eliasson  who presided so ably over the sixtieth session. Today  as the United Nations approaches the end of one era and the beginning of another  the Maldives expresses its profound appreciation to the outgoing Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. He has led the Organization for a decade  with great devotion and skill.  Modernization should be a top priority for any organization that wants to remain relevant in a time of rapid change. It is particularly important for the United Nations because of the central role that it must continue to play in promoting cooperation for international peace and security  economic and social development  human rights and the rule of law. The Maldives believes that reform of the United Nations must be transparent  balanced  comprehensive and inclusive.  In addition to modernizing the Security Council  we must strengthen the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. These reforms must make the Organization more action-oriented and democratic. A reformed United Nations must be responsive to the entire membership  and be faithful to its founding principles. The Organization must be adapted to carry out its mandate in full. There can be no doubt that this can be achieved by gearing the United Nations to implement all its mandates  decisions and resolutions without fear or favour.  The question of equitable representation and an increase in the membership of the Security Council is a    06-52879 14  crucial part of the reform process. The Maldives believes the membership of the Council must reflect the realities of the present day. In this regard  the Maldives reiterates its support for the proposal of the group of four on Security Council reform.  For the Maldives the next few years will be a crucial period in our national development. As a result of national efforts made with the support of the international community  the Maldives is today set to say goodbye to its least developed country status. The three-year smooth transition period will begin in January 2008. Graduation from the least developed country list will pose numerous challenges to us.  However  we look forward to that event as a positive development. We have already begun work with the donor community to identify ways in which the economic and social progress of the country will continue without disruption after graduation. In this regard  I note the successful launching of the Maldives Partnership Forum as an annual event. The first such forum was held in June this year. I wish to thank our donors for their continued commitment to support the development of the Maldives beyond graduation.  The graduation of the Maldives from least developed country status to that of a developing country coincides with an important political phase in the country’s development. Over the past three years we have been engaged in a major political transformation. These reforms are based on the sustained social and economic progress that has qualified the Maldives for graduation. The political reform programme that we began in 2003 covers institutionalizing political pluralism and strengthening human rights protection  media freedom and judicial reform.  The achievements of the programme to date include the formation of four political parties last year  strengthening the fundamental rights of the people and enhancing the rule of law. Also a constitutional assembly is in session to modernize the constitution. Other projects are being implemented to overhaul the criminal justice system  set up a modern police service  strengthen media freedom and develop civil society.  We are also determined to meet the standards prescribed in international human rights treaties. Over the past two years we have acceded to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol. We have also acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Just yesterday I deposited with the Secretary-General our instruments of accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol and to the International Covenant on Economic  Social and Cultural Rights.  The Maldives was the country worst affected by the 2004 tsunami. Twenty-one months into the recovery programme  much has been achieved  but much remains to be done. I take this opportunity to thank the donor community and friendly countries for the support and assistance extended to our recovery programme. The biggest obstacle to the programme is the substantial funding shortfall in key aspects of recovery  in particular in the areas of repair and reconstruction of housing  transportation  water and sanitation  and environmental mitigation. The funding gap is estimated at $100 million. In addition  as a result of the impact of the tsunami and of high petroleum prices on public finances  there is a budget deficit of $100 million. At this critical juncture of our national progress I call upon our development partners  and the international community as a whole  to continue to assist the Maldives.  It is a matter of satisfaction to us that  despite the devastation caused by the tsunami and the short-term fiscal pressures  the Maldives has been able to meet some international development targets. In reducing poverty and in providing primary education the Maldives has already met the Millennium Development Goals. We are confident that we can attain the targets for health care and gender empowerment.  Instability in any part of the world has implications for the entire international community. One of the most intractable disputes of our time is the conflict in the Middle East  particularly the non-realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. The recent hostilities in Lebanon and the sufferings of the Lebanese people have their roots in the Palestinian problem. The Palestinian issue must be resolved  in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council.  The continued instability and violence in Afghanistan and Iraq is a matter of great concern to the Maldives. Years of instability and conflict have   15 06-52879  ravaged the lives and society of the peoples of these countries.  The Maldives fully subscribes to the efforts made by the international community to combat terrorism. We are party to the major international conventions that have been formulated to defeat terrorism. Terrorism is an assault on the values of freedom and human solidarity. However  our efforts to combat the menace should avoid undermining the very values that we seek to protect. There is a resurgence of the vilification of Islam and Muslims. As the Maldives has been a 100 per cent Muslim nation for more than 850 years  we are dismayed by this trend. Islam has provided the basis for peace and social harmony in the Maldives. Islam preaches moderation  not extremism. Violence and killing are abhorrent to Islam. The Holy Koran states  “Take not life  which Allah hath made sacred  except by way of justice and law.” (The Holy Koran  VI:151)  Needless to say  we are deeply pained and outraged by the negative imaging of Islam and the effort to associate fanaticism and violence with our peace-loving faith. The Holy Koran says  “Allah commands justice  the doing of good  and liberality to kith and kin  and He forbids all shameful deeds  and injustice and rebellion.” (ibid. XVI:90)  Only love can conquer hatred. Knowledge alone can overcome prejudice. Tolerance can defeat fear. Stable peace requires inclusion. Effective and meaningful dialogue among civilizations and mutual respect among diverse peoples are necessary to address the challenges that we face today. Tolerance and respect for diversity are given a high value in Islam.  Civilization is under serious threat from the continued degradation of the environment and its resultant effects of global warming  climate change and sea-level rise. Small island States such as the Maldives and other low-lying regions of the world are in the front line of danger from rising seas. The extreme weather events of the past few years have been more frequent and destructive than ever before. They clearly demonstrate that the entire world is vulnerable to the devastation caused by climate change. The Kyoto Protocol has been a great disappointment. We call upon all countries to accelerate the adoption of urgent and realistic measures to stop climate change and sea-level rise.  If we are to address the vast array of challenges that humanity faces today we must effectively implement crucial blueprints and action programmes agreed through the multilateral process. We must breathe new life into Agenda 21. We must also adhere to the Monterrey Consensus. The Millennium Declaration must be followed up diligently. And  as Secretary-General Kofi Annan said earlier this month  the United Nations must move from a culture of reaction to one of prevention.  Today I am speaking in my vernacular language  Dhivehi. It represents the legacy of several millenniums of continuous settlement and the culture that it has produced in the Maldives. Is not the protection of such legacies the touchstone of success of this global family of nations? If the United Nations can make small and vulnerable countries feel safe  then who will be facing any danger at all? "
"111",4542,"MEX",61,2006,"Twenty-one years ago  on a day like today  a terrible earthquake battered my country. We remember the victims  and we express our ongoing solidarity with their family members.  Madam President  on behalf of Mexico  let me congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We wish you every success.  The Mexican people thank Mr. Jan Eliasson for his leadership during the Assembly’s sixtieth session    06-52737 4  and for his contribution to the United Nations reform process.  Mexico warmly welcomes the people of Montenegro to this Organization of free and juridically equal nations. We welcome all nations that today have joined the free and democratic nations  through genuine representation of their peoples  and are united in the struggle against terrorism and in favour of human rights.  A few days ago  we commemorated the fifth anniversary of a terrorist act that plunged many families of this and other countries into mourning. We offer our sympathy to those who have suffered the violence and cruelty of terrorism. Mexico strongly condemns that terrible evil  as it condemns all acts of aggression or violence. We repudiate any action that undermines peace or conflicts with the noble principles and purposes of our Organization.  Throughout the past six decades  the peoples of the United Nations have seen that the use of force does not solve problems; on the contrary  it often aggravates them. Peace and development are the fruit of mutual respect and the cooperation to which such respect gives rise.  The peoples of the United Nations are well aware that the deterioration of peace and security is the result of insufficient international dialogue and cooperation. We know  too  that many of the setbacks — such as those in the field of disarmament and those that take the form of aggression against other people or the environment — are caused by a lack of respect among nations.  These are very challenging times. Our peoples today face such situations as the persistence of long-standing international conflicts or the emergence of new tensions and threats to international peace. They also must tackle problems ranging from poverty  disease and illiteracy to inequality of opportunity and the urgent need for more inclusive dialogue aimed at increasing mutual understanding.  Humanity is desperately seeking respect  understanding  and cooperation among nations. There will be no peace without respect among nations  no development without cooperation among them.  These are challenging times  but also times of hope. I believe that hope and goodness alone can give us the necessary strength and drive to achieve our goals and fulfil our dreams.  This house  the foremost of the international forums established by mankind  is built upon the principles and values shared by all peoples  the product of their common essence. Here  we summon up what is best in us. Here  we show that what unites us is not force and animosity  but hope and solidarity. Here  we are united by our ideals and our will to preserve future generations from the scourge of war. Here  we work together to foster the dignity and worth of the human person  and  shoulder to shoulder  we promote the economic and social progress of all of our peoples. Here  we make firm commitments  such as the Millennium Development Goals  and we work enthusiastically in order to go forward and achieve those goals. This is no small task. There are many challenges  because the goals are ambitious. The magnitude of the challenges cannot and should not overshadow the scope of our common will.  Mexico’s message is one of hope and of faith in what we are capable of achieving together. It is a message of confidence in the work done by our United Nations. This is the message of Mexico  whose people conquered democracy in 2000 and in so doing inspired hope for a new future of prosperity and justice.  Mexico is a country with well-established institutions which guide and lead our nation. It is currently experiencing unprecedented freedoms. My people live and work in peace  enjoy stability and have their eyes set on new horizons of well-being and justice.  The democratic Mexico is firmly committed to protecting human rights. We are very proud to be a founding member of the Human Rights Council and to occupy its first presidency. We will continue working with enthusiasm and determination in order to make the Council an organ that responds effectively to the challenges posed by human rights.  Mexico is a country that cherishes its roots and traditions and treasures its heritage as a land of many and diverse cultures. We prize the legacy of our indigenous peoples and are proud of our indigenous present. We are actively engaged in the recognition and promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples at the international level.   5 06-52737   In May  a Rarámuri woman from the state of Chihuahua named Isabel said to me  “Mr. President  it is certainly true that all human beings are different from one another  that we see the world through different lenses and that we do not all share the same beliefs. Nevertheless  all human beings are equal in dignity and stature”. She asked me to pass on that message. I promised her that I would do so  and today I am keeping my word by bringing Isabel’s voice and those of our other indigenous sisters and brothers to this forum. Isabel’s voice is the voice of all Mexican women and men who are fighting discrimination.  Thanks to the commitment of the members of the Human Rights Council  the General Assembly will have before it for consideration a draft United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. On behalf of the indigenous peoples of Mexico and of the rest of the world  I call upon each and every State Member of this Organization to adopt that draft Declaration and to endow it with the means necessary for it to promote respect for the rights of indigenous peoples.  Five years ago  in a spirit of great enthusiasm and in the quest for a more just and human-centred world for millions of people with disabilities  my country  Mexico  presented the General Assembly with a proposal for a draft United Nations convention on the protection and promotion of the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. We now have a draft text that will prompt Governments and society to pay more attention to people with disabilities. I urge all nations to sign and ratify that legal instrument — proposed by my country and already endorsed by many of the nations represented here — with a view to creating a world of greater justice  humanity and dignity for all.  Mexico believes in the United Nations — in its present and in its future. We have always worked here in a constructive manner  promoting consensus and harmony and putting forward initiatives to address the greatest challenges of our times.  I would like to thank and pay tribute to the heads of State of Algeria  Australia  Canada  Colombia  Chile  Germany  Japan  Kenya  the Netherlands  New Zealand  Pakistan  Singapore  Spain and Sweden for their support for the Mexican initiative to establish the Group of Friends for United Nations Reform. Together  we presented proposals that were taken up in the Secretary-General’s report of March 2005 (A/59/2005).  I am certain that our commitment to reform of the United Nations will result in a stronger Organization that is capable of accomplishing the lofty objectives for which it was created. Mexico is convinced of the need to promote a reform of the Security Council that can guarantee the Council’s representativeness  efficacy and transparency  as well as ensure accountability. That objective will not be reached by creating new permanent seats.  We are an Organization based on the principle of the juridical equality of States. The reform of the Security Council should ensure more frequent participation by all Member States in the activities of that body. That is why Mexico proposes an increase in the number of non-permanent seats  with the possibility of immediate re-election.  As this is the last time that I will speaking in the Assembly in my capacity as President of Mexico  I would like to express my gratitude to all Member States for their support for all of our efforts and initiatives over the past six years.  I would like to express my deep appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  a good friend of Mexico. He will be remembered for his efforts to reform and strengthen this Organization and for his passion for peace and harmony among nations.  I would like to reaffirm my country’s unconditional commitment to the objectives of the San Francisco Charter  to the reform process currently under way and to our common quest for a world free from poverty  fear and despair — a world of mutual respect  peace and harmony.  From this rostrum I appeal  on behalf of Mexico  for respect and peace among nations. In particular  I call on the United Nations to continue to promote an effective peace process in the Middle East.  There is no greater enemy or obstacle than hopelessness  unkindness and lack of solidarity. Let us build a future based on the strength of our ideals and values  confident that our United Nations can achieve great things.  In the same spirit that made our peoples free  sovereign  democratic and human-centred nations  I invite the Assembly today to set its sights on a future of greater freedom  justice  brotherhood and solidarity among human beings. "
"112",4567,"MHL",61,2006,"I wish to join others in congratulating you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Please be assured of my country’s support and cooperation throughout your tenure.  The Marshall Islands commends all members of the General Assembly for their efforts  contributions and cooperation throughout the sixtieth session aimed at achieving many of our common aspirations. Although we have achieved a good measure of success  there is still much work ahead. We must work together and pool our resources  our talents and our skills for the betterment of all the citizens of the world. It is in this regard that I urge the wealthier and more developed Member States to increase their generosity    06-53952 18  with official development assistance so as to address issues of human misery.  As one of the smallest States Members of the United Nations  the Marshall Islands hopes that the sixty-first session of the General Assembly will do more to protect and secure our people from threats to their livelihood and existence.  The Marshall Islands is committed to various international and regional plans and agreements  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the Mauritius Strategy for the further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  the Pacific Plan and  more recently  the Micronesian Challenge initiative  which sets ambitious targets for marine and terrestrial conservation areas throughout the Micronesian region.  We emphasize the need for the full and effective implementation of the commitments  programmes and targets adopted  particularly those of the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States  and for the mobilization of the necessary resources from all sources for the effective implementation of the Mauritius Strategy.  Given that the livelihood of our people depends heavily on the oceans  we again join our Pacific neighbours in requesting that our ocean resources be managed and protected from exploitation. Because our nation’s single most important productive sector is fisheries  which provide us with our key export  the state of the world’s oceans and fish stocks and the way in which those vital resources are being exploited remain concerns of the utmost importance.  As a party to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement  we recognize the importance of the entry into force of the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean and the subsequent conservation and management measures adopted thus far by the recently established Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission.  While we acknowledge the implications and adverse impact of illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing in the region  including the consequences of over-fishing for national and regional resources  we are continuing to develop and explore ways and means of conducting and enforcing conservation and management measures  as well as of developing our domestic fisheries. We seek a moratorium on bottom trawling until there are clear indications that it has no effects on ocean biodiversity.  It is our hope that regional efforts — such as those being undertaken by the small islands developing States — to spread the knowledge of conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity will be strengthened and enhanced by international assistance.  At the national level  I wish to share with Member States the progress that we have made in terms of Government leadership and national development. Our national and local government leaders met early last month to review our progress in achieving our long term National Development Plan. This provided a chance for both the national Government and local governments to renew their commitments to work together to bring about a better Marshall Islands. It also paved the way for Government officials to discuss issues of critical concern that continue to obstruct our development opportunities in the areas of education  health and the environment  among others.  Another important issue also being discussed on the home front is that of the nuclear-weapons tests that were conducted in the Marshall Islands. Our people have made a disproportionate sacrifices in helping the world understand the power of the nuclear bomb. We have paid with our own lives  our health and the well-being of our land and waters  which are so sacred to us. Since the Marshall Islands became independent  in 1986  we have undertaken efforts to better understand the impact of the activities that took place on our islands during the cold war. We are finding that the effects of the 67 atmospheric weapon tests conducted in our country were much worse and much more widespread than previously understood  although we still have a great deal more to learn.  As a small country with limited resources  we are of course focusing our efforts on addressing the nuclear legacy. We call on the United Nations and its agencies and on Member States that share similar experiences and have expertise in the restoration of environments contaminated with radiation and in   19 06-53952  addressing health needs linked to radiation exposure to assist and support the Marshall Islands Changed Circumstances Petition  which was submitted to the United States Congress in 2000. As knowledgeable and responsible leaders of the world community  the United Nations has the capacity to positively influence the well-being of the citizens of the Marshall Islands  who were under the care of the Trusteeship Council when the United States nuclear testing programme was in progress — from 1946 to 1958 following the Second World War.  Marshall Islands reiterates its firm commitment to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and its objectives of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology  fostering the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and furthering the goal of achieving general and complete disarmament. We urge those countries that have not already done so to become a party to the NPT  and those countries that are party to the NPT to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and fulfil their obligations under the Treaty.  Marshall Islands and French Polynesia know all too well that colonial Powers are willing to use territories other than their own to conduct dangerous nuclear weapons testing. In that regard  we call on the United Nations to continue to press for the decolonization of all nations in the Pacific region.  We also call on the United Nations to admit the 23 million citizens of Taiwan to the United Nations family. Taiwan  which shares the Organization’s view on the principles of universality and self-determination  has been enjoying a democratic Government of its own for over half a century. The fact that Taiwan has been denied membership into the United Nations again and again questions the legitimacy of the Organization. On behalf of my country  I therefore urge this body to welcome Taiwan into its membership.   Marshall Islands wishes to reiterate its support for the reform  restructuring and expansion of the Security Council. In particular  we emphasize the inclusion of Japan as a permanent member of the Council  and fully endorse Japan’s proposal on the methodology to be used in the preparation of the United Nations scale of assessments for the period 2007 to 2009. We are convinced that the entire membership of the United Nations would benefit greatly from Japan’s permanent membership and its proposed scale of assessments structure.  In the regional arena  last year Marshall Islands joined two of its neighbours in requesting that the United Nations step up its presence in the northern Pacific to pursue various development agendas  not only in our country but also in the Pacific region as a whole. I am pleased to inform the Assembly today that three United Nations agencies — the United Nations Development Programme  the United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF — have agreed to establish offices in various countries in the region  including the Marshall Islands.  Moreover  our Government has been working extensively with others in the region to implement the Pacific Plan  endorsed at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting held in Papua New Guinea in October 2005. I wish to join my colleagues in thanking our development partners for their assistance in making the Plan viable. Marshall Islands remains confident that the Pacific Plan will provide a useful framework for continued regional and international cooperation.  Internationally  the Marshall Islands joins other Pacific countries in reiterating our interests and asking the international community to recognize the vulnerability of small island developing States. They need the continued support of developed countries to build up their capacity to manage vulnerability  strengthen food security and build resilience to economic  social and environmental change. We appeal to the international community to support and enhance existing and new capacity-building efforts of  and among  small island developing States. We need the assistance of the international community to establish mechanisms to enable small island developing States to cope with  and adjust to  globalization and trade liberalization.  Marshall Islands consists predominantly of low-lying atolls that are an average of two metres above sea level. Our small atolls and islands are dwarfed by our surrounding exclusive economic zone  which consists of approximately 2 million square kilometres of ocean. While we rely on our ocean as a means of sustenance and survival  the sea becomes our biggest concern during increasingly severe weather conditions. We are fearful of sea-level rise  which is threatening the very existence of our islands.    06-53952 20   We therefore wish to reaffirm our grave concern regarding the vulnerability of small island developing States to the impacts of climate change  as well as the need for urgent action at the international level by the major emitters of carbon dioxide among developed and developing industrial countries to halt and reverse those devastating climate change impacts.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank President Jan Eliasson for his excellent management of the General Assembly presidency over the past year. I also wish to congratulate him on his appointment as his country’s Minister for Foreign Affairs. The General Assembly accomplished a great deal under his able leadership and I would like to commend him on his achievements. I wish him well in his new post.  The people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands join me in wishing Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Mrs. Nane Annan well in their future endeavours. I wish to convey our sincere appreciation for their gesture of friendship and goodwill during his tenure as Secretary-General of the United Nations.  In closing  I would like to assure the Assembly that my country will continue to work with the United Nations to meet our common challenges. Sixty-one years on  General Assembly members must move deliberately and decisively to overcome the dangers that lie ahead. We must meet our responsibilities to our respective countries and to each other as members of the General Assembly to ensure that we arrive at a better future. "
"113",4591,"MKD",61,2006,"It is my privilege to address this forum and share with it the views of the Republic of Macedonia on the issues of primary importance on this year’s agenda of the General Assembly and of the international community at large.  Terrorism is not a new world issue  but it has unfortunately become our tragic daily reality  thus rapidly gaining new and more devastating dimensions in the increasingly globalized world. We are all affected in one way or another — whether we speak about actual terrorist attacks or threats.  The real question  however  is: can we or should we  the nations of the world  continue to live in that kind of atmosphere  to live in fear  threatened? It would be a failure of humanity  of free spirit and democracy  of prosperity and mankind  and finally  if I may say so  a failure of all of us here at the United Nations. Recently we adopted the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. I believe it was high time that we adopted a unified position and strategy  that all of us gave a strong international response. Comprehensive international cooperation and coordination against this evil is equally important to activities at the national and regional level. We need to have results; the sooner  the better.  Outside this building  when the United Nations is mentioned  for many peoples  even nations  it means hope and help; it means peace; and it means cure. It means also freedom  democracy and safety — it means life. So the United Nations should not be shy to respond  to act and to resolve when it is asked. The United Nations has to react. Only by resolving problems do we make progress. We have to follow and react to the changes and to the new challenges that are incoming.  The overall reform of the United Nations  including better management  must be an ongoing effort. There are still issues from the World Summit Final Document yet to be delivered  such as mandate review and Security Council reform  to name only some. Hopefully  there will be enough understanding and progress achieved on them too.  Last month we had yet another reminder of how fragile world peace actually is. The Middle East again erupted. We have witnessed how difficult it is to restore peace  to hold a ceasefire and to send United Nations peacekeepers there. Macedonia welcomed the unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) of 11 August. Macedonia supports the efforts of the United Nations and the international community to provide timely humanitarian assistance to those affected and for the reconstruction of Lebanon.    06-52988 14  The United Nations must fight to make a lasting peaceful solution for the Middle East.  From the very beginning the Republic of Macedonia has been part of the international antiterrorist coalitions in Iraq and Afghanistan  and it has recently increased its contingents as part of the international forces. Peace- and democracy-building in those two countries remains one of the key challenges for the international community and the Iraqis and Afghans themselves. I again reiterate Macedonia’s support for their efforts to rebuild those countries and create a better life for their people.  Last year at the Summit we reaffirmed our commitment to the global partnership for development  as set out in the Millennium Declaration  the Monterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. It is beyond doubt that every country has a principal responsibility for its own development. However  it is more than obvious that national development efforts must be supported by global actions. The contribution of the private sector and civil society may play a critical role in our common endeavour.  In addition to human rights standard setting  the United Nations  since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  has been a guardian of human rights. We trust that the recently established Human Rights Council will give a new impetus in this area. We hope that the Commission’s weaknesses will be overcome  but we have to be aware that this requires a strong political commitment on the part of the membership. Guided by the wish to contribute to the work of this important body  we have announced our candidacy for membership for the 2009-2012 period.  Today Macedonia is a stable and functional multi-ethnic democracy. Over recent years we have launched and carried out a large number of reform projects  which have brought us closer to the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. In December last year Macedonia was granted candidate status for European Union membership. Macedonia rightfully expects that the pace of the needed reforms the country is committed to will lead to an opening of the negotiations on joining the European Union. As for NATO  we expect the invitation to join it at the next enlargement summit.  The region of south-eastern Europe to which my country belongs has experienced significant changes in the recent past and made considerable democratic progress: the start of European Union accession negotiations of Croatia and Turkey; Macedonia becoming a candidate country for membership in the European Union; the signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with Albania; and the opening of the negotiations for the same agreement with Serbia  Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro  the newly independent State. Furthermore  Romania and Bulgaria are expected to become full European Union members in a few months.  Good-neighbourly relations and regional cooperation have been and are among the top priorities of Macedonia’s foreign policy. We will continue to pursue such a policy even more vigorously. There is no alternative to dialogue  and all outstanding regional issues should be resolved in that manner. This year the Macedonian delegation will once again introduce in the First Committee a resolution entitled “Maintenance of international security — good-neighbourliness  stability and development in South-Eastern Europe ” which is traditionally widely supported and co-sponsored by Member States.  I should like to say a few words about the Kosovo issue and Kosovo’s future status. Macedonia fully supports the work of the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy  Martti Ahtisaari  and his team on the Kosovo status talks. I stress that every effort should be made to achieve a negotiated settlement mutually acceptable to the parties concerned  in line with Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the Contact Group guiding principles. The Republic of Macedonia  with its active good-neighbourly policy  has been a factor that has largely contributed  and continues to contribute  to the final  overall stabilization and positive developments in the region.  Yet there is one important  still pending  issue in this context for the Republic of Macedonia: that of the technical demarcation of our northern border on the Kosovo section  in line with the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  signed in February 2001  and the recommendations made by the then Secretary-General’s Special Envoy  Kai Eide. We urge that this issue be closed in that manner before the final Kosovo status decision is reached.   15 06-52988   I am confident that our deliberations will contribute to creating a better world for all. Although the debates at times show how different we are  our differences must not be an obstacle to our common vision. The personification of the hope of mankind for a better tomorrow remains with the United Nations. "
"114",4636,"MLI",61,2006,"At the outset  it is my great pleasure to express to you  Madam  the heartfelt congratulations of the delegation of Mali on your outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your election attests to your eminent personal qualities and is a tribute to your country  Bahrain  with which Mali    06-53005 44  enjoys fruitful cooperation. I assure you and other Bureau members  whom I also congratulate  of the support of my delegation.  I should also like to express our satisfaction to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his excellent guidance of the work of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session. History will recall his spirit of initiative and his commitment  which were decisive to the implementation of the outcomes of the September 2005 World Summit.  I should also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who  throughout his two terms  has carried out his mission with devotion and commitment.  Tomorrow  Mali will celebrate the 46th anniversary of its independence  but Mali is an ancient country  a country of traditions  a crossroads of civilization  a land of culture  dialogue and tolerance. Under the leadership of President Amadou Toumani Touré  our country continues every day to consolidate its model of democracy  which has been unanimously hailed in Africa and throughout the world. A new Mali — a democratic  united Mali — is on the march.  A symbol of that dynamic was the signing in Algiers on 4 July of the accord for the restoration of peace  security and development in the Kidal region. The Algiers agreement bolsters Mali’s firm resolve to opt for the peaceful settlement of disputes  fruitful dialogue and concerted action. The restoration of peace in the northern part of our country has allowed the various components of the Malian nation to work together in building our nation in a spirit of solidarity focused on the well-being and prosperity of all.  Similarly  our political system is being strengthened daily in a context of peaceful democracy  to the great satisfaction of our people  who have made the irreversible decision that any devolution of power must occur within a democratic and constitutional framework. To that end  in the first quarter of 2007 the people of Mali will be called to the polls — for the fourth time since the establishment of multiparty democracy in 1992 — to elect a president and renew the mandate of the deputies to the National Assembly.   Mali welcomes the choice of theme for the sixty-first session of the General Assembly on implementing a global partnership for development. In that respect  it goes without saying that the 2005 World Summit represented a decisive moment in the international community’s determination to ensure a better life for all the peoples of the world. At that time  our heads of State and Government reviewed the implementation of the internationally agreed development objectives  in particular the Millennium Development Goals  and reaffirmed their relevance  thereby confirming their importance at the heart of the development agenda.  In that regard  Mali has made the fight against poverty a priority of the Government’s actions. In May 2002  my country adopted a strategic framework for the fight against poverty  which sets priority development guidelines  particularly in the social spheres  in order to better meet the basic needs of our people by creating an environment conducive to sustained growth  enhanced participatory democracy  good governance and entrenched rule of law.   With respect to results achieved  the Government of Mali  with the assistance of its partners  is finalizing a new so-called second-generation strategic framework that will encompass  above and beyond the social sectors  the productive sectors of agriculture  industry and trade. In the same vein  we recently adopted a law on agricultural guidelines that makes agriculture the driving force of the national economy in order to guarantee food self-sufficiency and to ensure the well-being of our people.   Mr. Chungong-Ayafor (Cameroon)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Security cannot be ensured in an environment in which the movement of small arms and light weapons continues to destroy human lives  destabilize States and impede their economic and social development. In accordance with the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  we are firmly committed to mitigating the unspeakable suffering caused by those weapons and to ensuring individual security for all.   In that regard  in West Africa and in the context of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  we have taken significant measures to stem the scourge of the proliferation of light weapons. Indeed  the thirtieth conference of ECOWAS heads of State and Government  held at Abuja on 14 June  decided to back up the ECOWAS moratorium on the import  export and production of small arms and light weapons with executive power by converting it into a   45 06-53005  binding convention. That new instrument should contribute to building the capacities of Governments to exert stricter control over the traffic in small arms and to improve security arrangements within the Community.  Similarly  we cannot fail to welcome the launching  in Bamako on 6 June  of the new ECOWAS Small Arms Control Programme (ECOSAP). Over the course of six years  ECOSAP — via the intermediary of national commissions — will not only provide member States with technical and financial support  but will also contribute to building the capacities of a special unit in the ECOWAS Executive Secretariat.   On the other hand  we can only regret the fact that the United Nations Conference to review the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects failed to draft an agreed text because of the lack of progress in the priority areas of the bearing of arms by civilians  the management of stockpiles  references to human rights and the participation of civil society. As a result  we have fallen far behind in the Programme  the provisions of which we were supposed to improve. For its part  Mali reiterates its readiness to continue to work with other Member States to make progress on that important issue.  Rarely have international peace and security been put to such a harsh test by the resurgence of hotbeds of tension and conflict and acts of international terrorism. International terrorism is  as we all know  one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. In that respect  the attacks perpetrated worldwide vividly remind us that no country is safe from that phenomenon.  In order to create conditions conducive to responding to terrorism  it is urgent that we build national and regional capacities. To that end  we must overcome our differences in drafting a consensus definition and adopting a comprehensive strategy in that area. No cause  howsoever just or right  justifies the deliberate use of violence against innocent civilians. In that vein  we must promote a dialogue among civilizations  which remains fully relevant in an international context marked by a lack of trust among nations in terms of culture and religion.  The maintenance of international peace and security is a prerequisite of any development process. Mali therefore continues to be fully committed to the ideals of peace and stability  both within and beyond its borders.   On the African front  I welcome the progress made towards reconstruction and national reconciliation in many countries  including Guinea-Bissau  Sierra Leone  Liberia  Burundi and the Comoros. In Côte d’Ivoire  despite the clear lack of progress in the implementation of the road map  the peace process has reached a critical phase. Mali reaffirms its readiness to assist the Ivorian political actors in restoring lasting peace in that brotherly neighbour country.  In the Sudan  the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement  signed on 5 May in Abuja  is a major concern of the international community. We urge all parties involved to fulfil their commitments and to work to restore peace and preserve national unity.  In the same vein  we can only welcome the successful convening of the first general  free  multiparty elections to complete the process of democratic transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   The recent outbreak of violence in the Middle East recalls — as if there were any need to do so — the necessity for the international community to take appropriate measures to create conditions conducive to a lasting  negotiated and peaceful settlement to that crisis. While reaffirming our active solidarity with the people of Lebanon and Palestine  we are closely following developments in that region and will continue to support relevant United Nations resolutions on the Middle East and the Palestinian question.   While it is now recognized that trade is a factor for growth and development  we must also note that developing countries continue to suffer the repercussions of an unfair and discriminatory trade system  particularly given the tariff and non-tariff obstacles and subsidies for production and export that distort competition. Given their negative effects  such measures prevent the development of our agriculture  deny our producers — Malian cotton growers among them — a decent income  and keep them in the poverty that we have committed ourselves to eradicating by 2015.  In that regard  the hopes placed in the Doha Development Round contrast starkly with the major    06-53005 46  uncertainties arising from the recent failure of the trade talks on agricultural products. That is a source of legitimate concern to us. Mali urges all parties to be flexible and promptly to relaunch the Doha Round to ensure that trade liberalization serves the development of all nations without exception  particularly the poorest  so that we may raise millions of people out of poverty.  The issue of external debt is of particular importance to developing countries  especially the least developed. Indeed  despite the welcome measures to cancel the multilateral debt of certain countries  including Mali  the debt burden continues to weigh heavily on developing countries  undermine their development efforts and prevent their economic recovery. Those countries are locked in a cycle of dependence on outside financing and  if nothing is done  will fall behind in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  In such circumstances  we need to explore lasting solutions for making the debt less burdensome  including the cancellation of bilateral debt. Those countries need investment and to strive for the well-being of their peoples. There must also be accelerated progress towards a substantial increase in official development assistance if the ultimate goal of 0.7 per cent of the gross national income of the developed countries is to be reached.   The AIDS pandemic has spread so alarmingly that  beyond its health dimensions and given its vast reach  it has today become a development problem throughout the world. Indeed  in Africa it has become a health emergency  despite our national and international efforts. In the face of the pandemic  we need to step up our efforts and strengthen our resolve fully to implement the 2001 Declaration of Commitment and the General Assembly’s Political Declaration issued at the High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS in May and June this year. The XVI International AIDS Conference  held at Toronto in August 2006  it should be recalled  has highlighted the seriousness of the situation and the urgent need to take action.  At the national level  Mali has established a multisectoral programme for combating HIV/AIDS  whose implementation has made it possible to provide free access to antiretroviral treatment for patients and to carry out an awareness and education prevention campaign to stem the disease and its disastrous social effects. In the same vein  the Government has created a National High Council against AIDS under the direct authority of the President. I would like to take this opportunity to stress that the international community must continue to give the same priority to other diseases  such as malaria  tuberculosis and polio  whose consequences are just as devastating for our people as AIDS.  As for the situation of the disabled  Mali is pleased to have been a member of the working group that prepared the text that was the basis for a draft Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We welcome the negotiations under way within the Ad Hoc Committee  and we remain convinced that such a tool will create the framework for equality and the full participation of the disabled in efforts to build their respective societies.  As for the institutional reform of the United Nations  Mali welcomes the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission  one of the major results of the Summit of September 2005. For many years the management of post-conflict situations has been the weak link of our Organization. As is known  the impulse that gives rise to peacekeeping  for both donor countries and troop contributors  subsides once there is a semblance of stability. As a result  such situations quite often result in a resurgence of conflicts less than five years after they have ended  as we have seen from experience in this area.   How can we not welcome the creation and implementation of the Human Rights Council  of which Mali is a member  the Central Emergency Response Fund and the adoption of a series of resolutions on the follow-up to development? All those measures work together for the attainment of the wishes of the world’s leaders to address better the problems and the challenges of our time in order to bring changes in the priority areas of development  peace  collective security  human rights and reform of the Organization.  The progress achieved must not cause us to forget that much remains to be done  especially the necessary reform of the Security Council. While that need is unanimously accepted  it is no less true that not one of the formulas proposed has so far won consensus.  Mali  drawing on the Ezulwini Consensus and the Syrte Declaration adopted by the heads of State and   47 06-53005  Government of the African Union  strongly supports Africa’s claim to two permanent seats and five non-permanent seats. A Council thus reformed would better reflect the geopolitical realities of today’s world and would redress the historical injustice done to Africa  the only region without a permanent seat on the Security Council.  I would like to end by recalling that millions of persons in the world have placed their hopes for peace  security  development and solidarity in the United Nations. We have no right to disappoint them. As the community of nations  we have the obligation and the means to achieve all that through collective awareness and protection of our common values. This is what it will take for us to be in a position to guarantee future generations sustainable development that will protect them from the scourge of war. "
"115",4678,"MLT",61,2006,"I would like to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am confident that her efforts will ensure a successful outcome of this session. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing President  His Excellency Jan Eliasson  with whom the Assembly worked over the past 12 months on the successful implementation of many of the major reform tasks agreed upon at the Summit last year.  The theme chosen by the President for this year’s session — “Implementing a global partnership for development” — strikes at the heart of the challenges facing mankind today. It also reflects the Summit’s emphasis on the interlinked and mutually reinforcing nature of development  peace and security and human rights. Sustainable development in the economic  social and environmental sphere constitutes a key element of the overarching framework of United Nations activities. We support that approach and  convinced of the ripple effect of development policies that benefit all mankind  urge the General Assembly to increase its focus on development issues.  Poverty eradication and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are the priorities for this decade. In this regard  the Millennium Development Goals Report 2006 indicates that certain regions of the world have made much less progress than others. Extreme poverty remains a daily reality for the more than 1 billion people who subsist on less than one dollar a day. Whereas Asia leads the way in reducing poverty rates  the number of poor people in Africa is rising. In terms of per capita income  18 of the 20 poorest countries in the world are in Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest poverty rate in the world  and the situation of chronic food insecurity has not improved over the past decade. Four fifths of armed conflicts occur in Africa and Asia. Clearly  there can be no development without security and no security without development.  The realities of poverty  conflict and insecurity are at the root of the phenomenon of mass migration from Africa to Europe along the major routes — into the Canary Islands and mainland Spain in the eastern Mediterranean  and into Malta and Italy in the central Mediterranean.  Lack of development  security and good governance has a direct effect on a country such as mine  which  with 1 200 persons per square kilometre  is already one of the most densely populated countries in the world. In addition  it is a small island State with a small population of 400 000.  The burden of underdevelopment and lack of security in Africa  in particular sub-Saharan Africa  is therefore inordinately borne by my country  which is suffering real hardship as thousands of illegal migrants reach our shores. The 2005 statistics of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) rank Malta as the country with the second-highest number of asylum applications  in contrast to a 15.6 per cent decrease in asylum applications across the rest of the European Union.  We urge the United Nations and its agencies to address the issue of mass illegal immigration holistically and with vigour and urgency. In that endeavour  all the countries of world are called upon to combat criminal organizations that  across frontiers  are taking advantage of the aspirations of human beings who have nearly lost all hope. The rule of law    06-53329 30  must be respected. International obligations undertaken by countries in accordance with public international law must be honoured. Ignoring or insufficiently addressing the phenomenon of illegal immigration puts at risk the hard-won rights of genuine refugees and persons who must be protected with humanitarian status under international law.  I therefore call on the General Assembly and the United Nations as a whole — but in particular the UNHCR — to lend their full support to those countries that  like Malta  have an inherent fragility arising from density of population and smallness of territorial size in their efforts to combat illegal immigration and address the hardships that they experience as countries of destination.  Malta needs support — including from the UNHCR — in the resettlement of refugees and persons with humanitarian status. It needs support in shouldering the financial burden that it assumes in providing for the basic needs of the illegal immigrants on its soil. It needs international support in combating the criminal organizations that are benefiting financially from illegal immigration while putting the lives of immigrants at risk.  No country can tackle such an overwhelming phenomenon on its own. Illegal immigration requires a holistic international approach that includes combating criminal organizations — particularly in the countries of origin and transit — and strengthening border control; promoting good governance  economic development and the rule of law; resettling refugees and persons with humanitarian status; and returning illegal immigrants to their countries of origin and transit and reintegrating them into society. As part of such a holistic approach  we must take into consideration the special characteristics of a number of particularly vulnerable countries on the routes of migration between Africa and Europe  which  as countries of destination  are carrying a burden far greater than they can bear.  This issue was also examined in detail during the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  which took place last week. Malta  which took an active part in the Dialogue  looks forward to greater engagement on the part of countries of origin  transit and destination. In particular  we look forward to the high-level conference on migration of the European Union and the African Union  scheduled to be held in Tripoli  Libya  before the end of this year. Such engagement  which should have the active support of international organizations operating in this field  would continue the process of “trialogue”  which was successfully undertaken at the Rabat Conference last July. It could also serve as effective follow-up to the recent United Nations Dialogue.  In focusing on development issues  we must emphasize that development needs to be sustainable  to respect the environment and to take into account the rights of future generations  children  young people and those yet unborn. Development does not mean a free-for-all attitude towards the exploitation of the Earth’s bountiful resources. There must be sustainable development that allows our forests to regenerate  our air to be pure and our seas to be free of pollution.  Climate change and global warming are not issues that can be relegated to intellectual exercises. Positive political action is required to address the problems related to global warming and to prevent an exacerbation of the consequences of lack of care for the environment. As a number of dramatic experiences have already shown  the consequences of lack of respect for the planet and its environmental balances have been borne in particular by the world’s poor  whether in developing or developed economies. A concerted effort by all mankind is therefore required in this area. The United Nations is the appropriate forum for addressing these issues  which affect all countries. The fragility of our planet and its ecosystem means that all of us have a greater responsibility to act rapidly and together.  A global partnership for development needs to be carried out in peace and stability. However  in today’s world  global peace and security are constantly threatened by destructive and violent events. In that regard  we must pay particular attention to the prolonged impasse that has thwarted the work of the Conference on Disarmament. That impasse is endangering the very multilateral mechanisms that were created to foster peace  security and cooperation. States members of the Conference have a grave responsibility towards all United Nations Member States in helping humanity to address the challenges of non-proliferation  disarmament and arms control. As the Secretary-General stated in his address to the Conference on Disarmament last June  “With political will  this Conference can reclaim its former mantle and generate tangible benefits that could shape the course   31 06-53329  of history” (CD/PV.1028  p. 5). That is a challenge for us all.  Another challenge for us all is to persevere in all our efforts to resolve conflicts  even if they seem to persist over long periods of time and regardless of the number of peace initiatives undertaken by the international community.  The recent conflict in Lebanon was a tragic reminder of how easily a population can slide quickly back into a conflict situation. Today  the clouds have lifted a little so that new rays of hope can break through. We wish that country well. We believe that it could serve as a unique laboratory for democratic and cultural pluralism within a peaceful society in the Middle East.  In the same region  a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains elusive. Fatalism is not an option. The international community  through the United Nations and other mechanisms such as the Quartet  must maintain its concerted and determined efforts to find a comprehensive  just and lasting solution to this long-festering conflict  which has a bearing on all other issues in the Middle East and  indeed  in the wider global context. We welcome the intense and frank debate that took place last week in the Security Council on this issue (see S/PV.5530).  The President returned to the Chair.  Malta respects and supports the aspirations of the Palestinian people to nationhood and dignity  and in equal measure respects and supports the aspirations of the Israeli people to live in peace within secure borders. Those two aspirations are mutually compatible and achievable through peaceful and just means. A solution can be achieved only through strict and abiding respect for the rules and norms of international law  including humanitarian law.  On the ground  the continuing and increasingly deteriorating humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people is an intolerable burden on the international conscience. We must acknowledge and applaud the sterling work being carried out by the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  Ms. Karen AbuZayd  and all of the Agency’s dedicated staff to assist the refugee population in no fewer than 58 refugee camps in Gaza  the West Bank  Lebanon  Syria and Jordan  where one third of Palestinian refugees live.  The international community needs to continue to strengthen its tools for addressing natural emergencies wherever in the world they occur  in a spirit of solidarity with nations and human beings. In that regard  the decision taken earlier this year — as a follow-up to the Summit — on the revitalization and upgrading of the Central Emergency Revolving Fund — now the Central Emergency Response Fund — is an important step forward. In that context  the role of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  under the able leadership of Under-Secretary-General Jan Egeland  continues to be a crucial mechanism for dealing with the coordination needed to strengthen humanitarian responses to natural disasters and complex emergencies.  The tragic experience of the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami galvanized efforts to plot the outlines of an international early warning system across all oceans. That experience and its aftermath  however  show that much still remains to be done to respond more rapidly  efficiently and effectively to natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.  In this context  I note with great interest the valuable work done to date by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission’s Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami Early Warning and Mitigation System in the North-Eastern Atlantic  the Mediterranean and Connected Seas. Located at the centre of the Mediterranean and fully aware of the havoc that a tsunami could cause in the basin  Malta calls for speeding up the implementation of a Mediterranean tsunami early warning and mitigation system. This goal needs to be achieved as soon as possible. We are prepared to play a proactive role together with other States in the region in establishing a fully functioning tsunami warning system.  In such phenomena  not just regional but full global coverage is essential to the success of the system. The Assembly should examine what needs to be done to achieve this in the shortest time possible. In particular  recent tsunami phenomena which were smaller but which also claimed lives have shown that while it is important for countries to have early warning systems that are interlinked  it is equally crucial to transmit the early warning received by a    06-53329 32  country immediately to people on the beaches and in the most vulnerable coastal areas and to have in place crisis management mechanisms that can accelerate evacuation to safety. This requires the setting of international warning-transmission standards across the globe  which  if effectively implemented  can save lives.  Malta believes that this should be a joint task for the international community as a whole and calls on the international community to consider immediately the best means to respond to tsunami experiences with appropriate legal and other instruments that address the need for standards of transmission of early warnings to population in the most vulnerable areas in all the countries of the world. The setting of international standards for preparing for phenomena such as tsunamis can provide countries with an appropriate up-to-date measuring stick and continuously upgraded preparation.  The international community needs multilateralism. The process of institutional reform is another necessary and important component of efforts to enhance effective multilateralism. Over the past months  some slow progress has been made in following up the decisions taken at last year’s World Summit in this regard. We are all conscious of the efforts that need to continue at this session of the General Assembly on various aspects of institutional reform  including the most sensitive one  relating to the enlargement and reform of the Security Council. That matter has gained in urgency; the impasse should be broken by flexibility and openness to a search for common ground.  A new Secretary-General will be taking the reins of this Organization in the new year. The person elected will need all our encouragement and support to   fulfil the vital and demanding tasks of that unique office. To the outgoing Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  we express our immense sense of gratitude and admiration for the way in which he has conducted his work over the past 10 years and for his total dedication to the cause of peace and the international rule of law.  The cause of peace and the international rule of law are threatened daily by cultural and religious incomprehension. An alliance of civilizations  mutual respect and tolerance  acceptance of the other and of diversity  peaceful coexistence and cooperation and dialogue and education are the means which the international community has at its disposal to counteract the ugly phenomena of extremism and fanaticism. We cannot ignore this threat to peace and stability  a threat that is compounded by poverty and mass migration. We must further strengthen multilateralism as a means of world governance.  In this context  we need to keep in mind the general without losing sight of the specific. The United Nations must remain the focus of the debate on this issue and needs to continue to engage with the world media to spread the message and spirit of fraternity in a world where large or small does not count. Equally  experience has amply illustrated that small countries  just as large ones  are essential to global security  cultural interchange and respect and tolerance for diversity.  As a Mediterranean State  as a member of the European Union  as current Chair-in-Office of the Commonwealth and  generally  as a member of the international community of States  Malta is determined to continue to make a contribution in all those forums — and in this forum — towards the interests of peace  justice and the rule of international law in the world today and in the future.

"116",4724,"MMR",61,2006,"First of all  I wish to congratulate Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are convinced that her vast experience in international relations and able leadership will lead this session to a successful conclusion.   I would also like to pay tribute to her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  who led the last session of the General Assembly most ably and successfully.  I would also like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  whose stewardship of this Organization over the past 10 years has brought many positive and remarkable changes to the world body. His tireless and dedicated service to the international community will be indelibly etched in our collective memory.  The reform of the United Nations to meet the new challenges of our times is an ongoing process that needs to be assessed continuously. While we have achieved tangible progress in some areas  such as the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  progress has yet to be made in other areas. The success of the reform of the United Nations must be judged in terms of its effective response to the contemporary needs of Member States  in particular those of the developing countries  which form the majority of the membership. While many States  including the developing countries  struggle to protect and advance the principles and practices of multilateralism  the tendency towards unilateralism remains strong. That unhealthy tendency can in no way gain ascendancy if the United Nations is to remain viable.  Attempts by some strong and powerful States to impose their will on developing countries in pursuit of their political agenda create an environment of hostility in the international community. To our dismay and frustration  there has been glaring abuse of the mandate    06-53615 10  entrusted to the Security Council by Member States by unjustly placing the situation of my country on the agenda of the Security Council and by alleging that it poses a threat to regional peace and security. Nothing could be further from the truth. Myanmar has done nothing that can undermine the peace and security of any country  let alone regional or international peace and security. Myanmar has close and cordial relations with all its five neighbours and other countries in the region.  The founders of the United Nations did not intend the world body to become a forum in which some Members with political and economic clout could gang up against a Member State and label it as what it is not. We therefore urge all Member States to resist attempts by those powerful States to influence the Security Council to take action against a Member State that in no way poses any threat to international peace and security.  Regarding Security Council reform  Myanmar is in favour of the expansion of the Security Council in both the permanent and non-permanent categories. The expanded Security Council must also reflect today’s political and economic realities. However  the fact that we have not made substantial progress on the expansion of the Council demonstrates the sensitive and complex nature of the issue. It is extremely important that this issue not become divisive among the United Nations membership. Dialogue and consultations must continue to seek a solution acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the membership.  It is encouraging that the first session of the Human Rights Council was successfully held in Geneva in June and that the Council is now working in full swing to quickly become an effectively functioning human rights body. Myanmar’s active participation at the highest level in that session is a reflection of our commitment to further strengthening the United Nations human rights machinery.   It is  however  important that the principle of impartiality  objectivity and non-selectivity be scrupulously observed in the work of the Council. Although we want the Council to become an effective tool in the strengthening of the United Nations human rights machinery  we are not giving it carte blanche. It is through the observation of the aforementioned principles — through dialogue  cooperation and non-politicization of human rights issues — that the Council is to function. It is incumbent not only on the members of the Council  but also on all of us  to ensure that the Council does not deviate from the direction in which we expect it to head.  Terrorism continues to defy the attempts of the international community to eliminate it  raising its ugly head again in Mumbai and elsewhere very recently. We are of the view that it is only through the involvement of every community of people that we can be forewarned in time of the impending onslaught of terrorist acts. Myanmar fully supports the international efforts to eliminate terrorism.   A daunting challenge facing the international community is the horrendous crime of human trafficking  which the Secretary-General aptly refers to as one of the most reprehensible violations of human rights. Despite the efforts of the international community to tackle that issue over the past decade  it continues to grow  with serious national and international implications for the Governments concerned. Human trafficking is a serious international issue and we believe that it requires a coordinated and cooperative response by the entire international community to address the issue.  Myanmar is a State party to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its supplementary Protocols to Prevent  Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons  especially Women and Children and against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land  Sea and Air. I would like to stress that Myanmar regards combating trafficking in persons as a national task. We are making relentless efforts in that regard.  Myanmar has designated HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis as diseases of national concern. In 1989  we set up a high-level multisectoral national AIDS committee. We have been cooperating with the United Nations and  in 2001  our national AIDS programme and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) drew up a joint programme of action covering education  prevention  cure and rehabilitation to effectively address the challenge. As a result  we have been able not only to level the HIV/AIDS infection rate  but to reduce it. We are also serving on the UNAIDS Programme Coordinating Board  enabling us to address the issue at both the national and international levels.   11 06-53615   Narcotic drugs continue to be one of the threats facing us today. As the Government of Myanmar regards the eradication of narcotic drugs as a national responsibility  it has striven relentlessly to eradicate such drugs by 2014. Our determined efforts on all fronts have resulted in a substantial decrease in opium production. I would like to reiterate here that Myanmar will step up its efforts  in close cooperation with friendly countries and international organizations  until we achieve our goal.  Cooperation with the United Nations is a cornerstone of Myanmar’s foreign policy. Our track record has proven that Myanmar has invariably extended its cooperation to the United Nations. Myanmar has been implementing a national development plan with the aim of accelerating growth  achieving equitable and balanced development  and reducing the socio-economic development gap between rural and urban areas of the country. The national development plan addresses the major aspects of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We have made significant progress towards achieving the MDGs by 2015  particularly in such areas as health  education  sustainable access to safe drinking water  and access to improved sanitation. In implementing the MDGs  we are primarily relying on our national resources. In that regard  we are also receiving valuable assistance and cooperation from the United Nations agencies concerned.  Finally  I wish to apprise the Assembly of the political developments in my country. We have been steadfastly implementing the seven-step road map for transition to democracy  announced in August 2003. The National Convention  which was adjourned on 31 January 2006  will resume its session on 10 October and continue to discuss the basic principles for the drafting of an enduring constitution. I wish to stress that the process of transforming the country into a democratic State will move ahead systematically in accordance with the road map.  Before concluding  I would like to reaffirm our commitment to working together in upholding the principles enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations and in strengthening the role of the United Nations to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century.

"117",4735,"MNE",61,2006,"Allow me first to welcome your election  Madam  to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-  19 06-52879  first session  confident that it will result in important decisions in the common interest.  It is with particular pride and emotion that I wish to recall the sixtieth session  during which many decisions  important for the Organization  were made. In Montenegro it will be remembered as historic since it was at that session that our nation was admitted as a fully fledged Member of this unique world organization. I wish therefore to thank the Secretary-General and the President of the sixtieth session   Mr. Eliasson  and the other representatives of nations in this forum for having contributed to making the ceremony of Montenegro’s admission as the 192nd Member State of the United Nations so uplifting.  It is a great honour and pleasure at this session to represent Montenegro which for the first time now participates in the debate as a fully-fledged Member. As the President of Montenegro  Filip Vujanovic  has already stressed from this rostrum  we see this as a huge chance  as well as a huge responsibility. Montenegro is a young European nation that has existed on its own on the international scene for only a few months  but it is firmly determined to continue with even more strength to contribute to peace  stability and prosperity  by respecting and promoting the underlying ideas  principles and goals of the United Nations and its documents. I am strongly convinced that in the time in which we live the importance of a State  big or small  primarily depends on its contribution to the respect for and implementation of these fundamental international values and standards. This is relevant in both a regional and a broader context.  It is in the nature of small States to be more sensitive to the need for tolerance and dialogue  for openness  and international relations based on mutual trust  equality and solidarity  and also to the value of unity in diversity  which is the axiom of this time  and of global integration  the basis on which today’s Montenegro is developing. In this sense I would add that small nations are destined to be elitist. I hope that it is not presumptuous to say that Montenegro promoted these principles best in the recent referendum that we organized in full partnership with the European Union  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  and the Council of Europe  proving that even in south-eastern Europe the most difficult and most sensitive issues — such as the status issue — can be tackled in a democratic fashion and in accordance with the highest international standards. We are therefore proud to stress that the democratic process and outcome of the Montenegrin referendum is also a European policy victory in our region  and are confident that through this example we can contribute to stability and good-neighbourly relations in our region.  Indeed  regional cooperation is inseparable from European and global integration  which are essentially about issues of peace  stability  security and prosperity  the more so as the globalization that is gaining momentum confronts us with new challenges and new threats of a political  environmental and socio-economic nature. The issues of today  such as international terrorism  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  illegal migration and trafficking  poverty  threats to the environment  and so forth  highlight the need for common action.  This vision of the future is exemplified in the Millennium Declaration  which projects the principles and goals of the Charter to the world in a new age  highlighting common responsibility and solidarity in order to accomplish a vision of a more secure  prosperous and just world. Without stability there is no democracy  just as without democracy there is no stability or sustainable economic development. These are interdependent processes that must take place simultaneously  and that highlights the importance of accomplishing the Millennium Goals. All this brings to the fore the importance of efficient multilateralism through action by the United Nations  which needs to be reformed in order to adequately cope with today’s challenges  as well as other international and regional organizations and all nations.  With full awareness and responsibility we will continue to build in Montenegro stable institutions that guarantee the rule of law  freedoms  equality and non-discrimination  human and minority rights as well as solidarity and a market economy. We will also continue to promote multi-ethnic harmony and tolerance  convinced that religious and cultural diversity is enriching and conducive to greater stability and growth. It is also conducive to striking a balance between the State and the individual  fully in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.  In this context I wish to express my gratitude to the specialized United Nations agencies for their    06-52879 20  efforts and support. I believe it is important to stress from this rostrum that in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme and our European partners we will build the first eco-building designed to house United Nations agencies operating in Montenegro.  We are very proud that at the very outset of life on its own Montenegro was admitted to the United Nations  the institution that is the meeting point for a multitude of cultures and identities  which it merges into one address that each and every one of us identifies with  an institution in which all peoples and States enjoy full equality. We see this as historic proof of acknowledgement of respect for the fundamental values and goals of the United Nations  still equally valid today. I am confident that Montenegro will distinguish itself even more as a trustworthy and constructive partner and that our cooperation within the United Nations will take on a new quality and will remain a key component of the political action of Montenegro. Today’s Montenegro has a clear vision of development and of its European perspective  and is ready to fully contribute to a united Europe and the United Nations. "
"118",4781,"MNG",61,2006,"Considerable progress has been made in implementing the specific set of actions to ensure peace  development and human rights that was agreed upon by more than 150 heads of    06-53005 20  State or Government at last year’s World Summit. The Peacebuilding Commission  the Human Rights Council  the Central Emergency Response Fund  the United Nations Democracy Fund  the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and other achievements speak for themselves.  However  we cannot afford to be complacent about what we have achieved so far. Redoubled efforts ought to be made to ensure that people in every corner of the world feel the benefits of development in their everyday lives. Secretary-General Kofi Annan  in his annual report on the work of the Organization  observes that   “The words of 2005 have yet to have a direct impact on the lives of the poor people they are meant to help. Nor have they produced the implementation breakthroughs required to achieve the Millennium Development Goals”. (A/61/1  para. 27)  That conclusion is sad  but true.  My delegation therefore welcomes the most timely initiative of the presidency to focus our attention at this session of the General Assembly on the implementation of the global partnership for development. The global partnership for development was framed as Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 8 and thus cannot be divorced from other development goals and objectives.   In our view  the global partnership for development means a global compact between developed and developing States. It is the responsibility of developing countries to formulate and implement sound policies to ensure their sustainable economic and social development and  to that end  to mobilize domestic resources. For the developed countries  it entails an obligation to support such efforts through the provision of development financing  including official development assistance (ODA)  in a timely and sufficient manner and to ensure increased market access for developing countries. Mongolia  for one  takes its responsibilities seriously and is committed to its development objectives.  Allow me to describe the policies and specific actions taken by my country to implement the MDGs  as well as my views on the need to build partnerships to achieve them. First  Mongolia attaches particular importance to its implementation of the MDGs. Our first progress report was discussed at both the Cabinet and parliamentary levels  resulting in parliament’s adoption in April last year of a resolution institutionalizing Mongolia’s MDGs. Thus  the Goals have been mainstreamed into the guidelines for the country’s economic and social development  and the funds necessary to meet the individual goals are reflected in the annual State budget.  Secondly  to honour its commitment made in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (resolution 60/1)  Mongolia is developing an MDG-based comprehensive development strategy and plans to submit the first draft to parliament during its autumn session. The active participation of political parties  civil society and the private sector in that undertaking will ensure the sustainable implementation of the national development strategy over the years.  Thirdly  the adoption of an additional  ninth  Millennium Development Goal (MDG) — on the promotion of human rights  fostering democratic governance and combating corruption — was an innovative step that reflected the indissoluble link between development  good governance  human rights and democracy in our national policy. Within the framework of working towards meeting that goal  the parliament recently passed a new law against corruption  thereby creating a legal environment to remove the shackles that that phenomenon imposes on development. In accordance with the new law  a new anti-corruption body is to be set up to deal with raising public awareness and to address ways to prevent and uncover corruption  investigate cases of corruption and audit the financial and income declarations of public officials.  Fourthly  the Government of National Unity  which was formed early this year  is undertaking a host of quick-impact projects on poverty reduction and income-generation in the implementation of its MDGs  in order that the benefits of the social security policy can reach various strata of the population. Allow me to cite a few examples.   Salaries in the public sector have been raised by 33 per cent  and the minimum wage by 30 percent. A monthly allowance is being provided to every one of the nearly 1 million children in Mongolia  which accounts for almost half of the entire population. Married couples and new-born children are provided financial support on a one-time basis. Mothers with   21 06-53005  five or more children and older persons have seen considerable increases in their monthly allowances and pensions. In collaboration with the private sector  this academic year my Government introduced a free school-meal programme for elementary school children. The launching of all those quick-impact initiatives will contribute to our efforts to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs.  Fifthly  on the policy level  my Government is placing particular emphasis on the human development dimension of the MDGs  including in such areas as education and health. For example  a programme on the theme of “A healthy Mongolian”  which is to be implemented between 2006 and 2008  will provide for medical check-ups and diagnosis and carry out surveys of the prevalent illnesses among the population over  15 years of age. The programme will also include preventive measures and treatment. Furthermore  the implementation of our education master plan for the period 2006-2015  will improve access to education and the quality and competitiveness of our national education system  ultimately advancing the level of human development. The plan will also contribute to the goal of increasing employment by means of developing human resources in a way that corresponds to the economic structure of the country and meets the demands of the labour market.   In addition  on the initiative of my Government  amendments have been made to the tax code that aim at easing the overall tax burden  thereby creating a favourable business environment  promoting greater economic growth and generating new jobs.  Although Mongolia is poised to achieve most of its MDGs by 2015 in the areas of education  gender  child and maternal health and combating various diseases  the goals of halving poverty and ensuring environmental sustainability continue to be a source of concern. It goes without saying that  like many other developing countries  Mongolia will not be able to achieve those goals on its own. Genuine partnership and effective cooperation between all stakeholders — including bilateral and multilateral donors  international financial organizations and the private sector — is therefore required in order to substantially reduce poverty and promote development in the developing world.   The quality of aid should also be improved through the tailoring of foreign grants and loans to the implementation needs of the MDGs and MDG-based national development strategies. That improvement should also be achieved by providing more predictable and multi-year aid flows  addressing weaknesses in institutional capacity and harmonizing the distribution of aid with the priorities of recipient countries  in accordance with the principles set out in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  Mongolia is a landlocked developing country dependent on a few export commodities. We are therefore highly susceptible to fluctuations in the world’s commodity and energy markets. I believe that the establishment of commodity-price stabilization mechanisms and anti-shock facilities could make a tangible contribution to poverty reduction measures in low-income commodity-dependent countries. At the same time  trade and investment are among the driving forces of development. The World Trade Organization Doha Development Round of negotiations should therefore be revived  with a view to creating a more favourable and just trade regime that involves market access and trade and industrial capacity-building assistance for developing countries  particularly for economically vulnerable States. For its part  Mongolia is preparing to host a conference of trade ministers of landlocked developing countries in 2007.  I should also like to urge the international community to focus its attention on the declaration adopted at the first-ever Meeting of the Heads of State or Government of Landlocked Developing Countries held last week in Havana. That document reflects the common position of landlocked LDCs. Its full implementation will be instrumental in assisting landlocked LDCs  including Mongolia  as they carry out their development and poverty reduction efforts.  Democracy plays an important role in bringing about peace and development. Although democracy is rooted in the soil of individual societies  it has to be supported through international cooperation. In its capacity as Chair of the fifth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies  Mongolia has endeavoured to promote democratic values at the international level. We have undertaken a set of concrete measures as follow-up to the fifth Conference  including the development of nationally owned democratic-governance indicators  a country information note and a national plan of action to consolidate democracy. We have also introduced a tripartite structure in the Conference to include    06-53005 22  Governments  parliaments and civil society. We have also set up a friends-of-the-chair group and are fully utilizing the follow-up mechanism in New York. It is gratifying to note that the international follow-up conference to the fifth International Conference  which was held in Ulaanbaátar last June  highly commended the work done over the last three years. My country is prepared to report on its activities and to share its accomplishments and lessons learned with the greater membership of the movement during the sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies  which is to be held next month in Doha  Qatar.  This year marks the 800th anniversary of the establishment of the great Mongol State — a remarkable date for my country. The General Assembly  in resolution 60/16  adopted last year  invited Member States  international organizations and academia to take an active part in the commemorative events associated with the anniversary. I wish to express our great appreciation to all persons —including people of Mongol ethnicity  academics and guests from various countries and organizations — for their active participation in the many international conferences organized in the spirit of that resolution. Those meetings included the international conference on traditions of Mongolian statehood  the ninth international forum of Mongolists  the convention of world Mongolians and the international workshop on the traditions of nomads. I am also happy to acknowledge that more than 300 high-level guests representing more than 30 States and Governments attended our national day ceremony — Naadam — which was the main commemorative event of the year.  The year-round celebration of activities and events are of particular importance  as they help us modern-day Mongols heirs to statehood preserve and develop nomadic culture and traditions and to re-introduce to the world our rich history and culture  along with the progress and challenges facing us today.  The sixty-first session has special meaning for us  as it coincides with the 45th anniversary of Mongolia’s membership in the world Organization. Our admission to the United Nations as a full-fledged Member  on  27 October 1961  was a historically important event for the people of Mongolia. Over the years  our cooperation with the United Nations has expanded in terms of both content and scope. The Organization’s support and assistance have been instrumental in helping Mongolia meet its development goals  build capacity and consolidate democracy. For its part  Mongolia has all along supported the United Nations. We have also striven to participate actively in its activities and to make our contribution to the efforts of the international community to find solutions to the pressing issues facing the world.  This autumn  we are about to select the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. Beginning in 2007  that person will represent the international community on the world stage. The next Secretary-General must be someone who will effectively follow through with the bold initiatives and reform efforts carried out by the current Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  in the areas of peace  development and human rights. That person must also be committed to making the world a better place  and possess strong managerial skills  vision and experience. In short  he or she must be a genuine leader. I am convinced that such a person can  and should  come from Asia  which is home to half of the world’s population.  Mongolia is prepared to participate actively in the work of the United Nations and of other multilateral organizations and processes. We reaffirm our commitment to the world Organization as a central coordinating instrument of the common efforts of the world’s nations to maintain peace and promote development. "
"119",4822,"MOZ",61,2006,"On behalf of the people and Government of the Republic of Mozambique  and indeed on my own behalf  I would like to place on record our congratulations to the President on her election to preside over the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. We are delighted to see a distinguished daughter of Bahrain in the stewardship of the highest organ of the United Nations.  We reiterate our congratulations to her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  Minister for Foreign   11 06-52988  Affairs of Sweden  for his leadership during the sixtieth session. We congratulate him once again on the commendable work done during his tenure of office.  We would also like to pay a glowing tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his accomplishments during his mandate as Secretary-General. We commend the devotion and tireless efforts of this son of Africa  our continent  for his work for the promotion of international peace  security and development  as well as for having created the solid foundations for wide-ranging reforms of the United Nations.  One of the issues on which our debate focused last year related to development. We noted with concern then that there was a substantive lack of progress in forging partnerships. In this regard  we salute the President for bringing the theme “Implementing a global partnership for development” for debate at this session.  We live in a very unbalanced world  in which developing countries find themselves in a vicious cycle of dependency and vulnerability. This plight undermines our efforts to address  speedily and successfully  the challenges that prevent our enjoying sounder economic and social growth and weaken our capacity to deal  more effectively and with greater impact  with the various manifestations of poverty and to fight  more vigorously  diseases such as malaria  tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Given our state of development  more often than not we are powerless to prevent or mitigate the impact of natural disasters and environmental degradation. Consequently  poverty prevents the part of our humanity located in developing countries from enjoying the freedom of choice and action that the other part of mankind takes for granted.  The merit of the theme that the President has put forward for our debate is that it gives us yet another opportunity to reflect on issues that we have dealt with in the past in seeking solutions for the remaining challenges imposed by underdevelopment. It also lends itself to a debate of at least three important issues related to the problem of underdevelopment.  The first is that no country alone  however resourceful it may be  can successfully overcome these challenges on its own  at least not in the medium term  because these are challenges noted for their complexity and interrelationships with other global problems and phenomena.   The second point that can be inferred from this theme is that  while underdevelopment can be attributed to or identified with a given country  its consequences transcend national borders. They go beyond geographical boundaries to  on the one hand  affect national security and demography in other countries and  on the other  raise moral obligations of new dimensions  as well as material challenges in other societies.  The third issue relates to a static view of poverty. The poor need to regain their self-confidence so that  like people in other parts of the world  they too can rid themselves of the shackles of poverty. By the same token  those who can assist also need to overcome the deep-rooted view that the poor will not escape from poverty  as they are destined to remain poor. On the other hand  they also need to overcome the preconceived idea that development must be imposed from the outside.  This discussion brings us back to our realization that  given the global nature of the challenges facing us today  we have no choice but to weave together and strengthen the national  regional and global partnerships. As a result of this realization  we adopted the Monterrey Consensus  as well as the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Millennium Declaration. The expectation was that these consensuses would translate  in concrete terms  into our commitment to forge global partnerships for development. Regrettably  little has been achieved so far. Abject poverty remains a common feature of the majority of developing countries.  Therefore  I urge that we need to reiterate our commitment to work together at various levels for the well-being of humanity. Mankind is not a far-fetched concept. For example  the very fact that the language I am using now can be translated into the other languages of the planet is a clear demonstration of how we belong to the same humanity. Let us  therefore  redouble our efforts so as not to frustrate the expectations of billions of citizens worldwide  in the developed and the developing countries alike. All of them are longing for a fairer  prosperous and peaceful world. Through these partnerships we can also  more effectively  contribute to conflict resolution in Africa  in the Middle East and in the world at large.  At this juncture  we would like to share with the Assembly our experience and views on the role and    06-52988 12  place of partnerships to overcome the challenges before us today.  At the national level  we are of the view that the development projects must be owned and driven by their primary and ultimate beneficiaries. In this regard  the Government creates and promotes an environment that facilitates the honing of self-esteem  promotes recourse to individual creativity and supports incremental development. At the same time  the Government encourages and sustains partnerships with other collective development actors  such as civil society organizations  the private sector and international partners in cooperation. The products of this approach to governance include  for example: the second Action Plan for the Reduction of Absolute Poverty for the period 2006-2009  drawn up with the active participation of civil society organizations; annual meetings with the private sector; meetings of the social partners  with the participation of the Government  trade unions and employers; the national forum for the African Peer Review Mechanism; and the joint review meetings between the Government and the development partners involved in direct budget support.  These partnerships are held together by our adherence to open and inclusive governance. They are also sustained by the collective commitment of various stakeholders engaged in the development of Mozambique to reduce the incidence of absolute poverty from 54 per cent in 2003 to 45 per cent in 2009. The environment of peace and stability in which we live and which we promote also contributes to enhancing these partnerships.  Regional cooperation plays an important role in building and sustaining partnerships for development. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a case in point. Since its birth  SADC has been playing a crucial role in promoting the political  economic and social integration of countries and peoples of the region. At the same time  SADC allows a given number of its member states to take initiatives that further its ultimate objective of a more prosperous region. In accordance with this principle  last August Mozambique  South Africa and Zimbabwe launched the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park  a project that aims to transform an area of approximately 35 000 square kilometres  rich in biodiversity  into a development hub.  Viewed as one of the building blocks of the African Union  SADC plays an important role in promoting the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  the African Union road map towards prosperity. We take this opportunity to commend the international community for aligning its assistance ever more closely with the NEPAD priorities. We would also encourage our development partners to increase their support for NEPAD.  By deciding last week in Havana on the continuation of the Non-Aligned Movement’s revitalization process  the Non-Aligned Summit put greater emphasis on the role the Movement should play in forging partnerships among the countries of the South  as part of the global partnerships. Thus  the Non-Aligned Movement reinvigorated the Bandung spirit  which  as we all know  inspired the establishment of the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership.  In addition to the Monterrey Consensus  we advocate an increase in international financial support  including official development assistance and foreign direct investment for countries such as ours that have potential for agriculture  agro-industry and tourism.  Similarly  we are in favour of the establishment of a fairer and more favourable global trading system that is more conducive to sustainable development in developing countries. In this context  we regret the lack of progress in the Doha Development Round  and we urge developed countries to be more flexible  within the framework of the World Trade Organization  in their approach to the needs of developing countries. We reiterate this appeal because we are convinced that our partners do not want to witness the perpetuation of the marginalization of developing countries from the global economy.  The assessment made in 2005 indicates that a number of developing countries are making progress towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. Mozambique is part of this positive trend. However  to ensure that it is irreversible  we call upon our development partners to continue to provide substantial and timely support for the priorities identified by the recipient countries. We believe that our partners are also touched  in their souls and in their spirit  by the poverty that still afflicts that part of humanity.   13 06-52988   In conclusion  we join previous speakers in emphasizing the need for the United Nations reforms to move forward. We all recognize the United Nations potential to forge effective partnerships for development. Therefore  we reaffirm the commitment of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique to contribute to the success of this reform process  always bearing in mind the need to safeguard the intergovernmental nature of the United Nations.  Mozambique is proud that its Prime Minister  Mrs. Luísa Diogo  is one of the Co-Chairs of the High-level Panel on System-Wide Coherence in the areas of development  humanitarian assistance and the environment  established by the Secretary-General. It is our belief that the Panel’s report will contribute to the success of the United Nations reforms. A reformed United Nations will be better placed to respond to the international challenges imposed by the need to strengthen international law and multilateralism and to promote partnerships for development and peace worldwide.

"120",4868,"MRT",61,2006,"Allow me first to warmly congratulate the President on her election. We firmly believe that her experience will guarantee an excellent grasp of all the issues and that she will carry out her task with wisdom and skill.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his admirable and tireless efforts in the reform process of the United Nations and moving it forward.  I also thank and congratulate Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  and his team for their untiring contribution to improving the work methods of the Organization in order to achieve its objectives in all areas.  I also take the opportunity to welcome the Republic of Montenegro as a new Member of the United Nations.  We particularly pay tribute to the important resolutions dealing with the creation of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Without a doubt  those two new bodies will contribute to improving the Organization’s activities to find   29 06-52988  solutions to two of the main concerns of the peoples and Member Governments of the United Nations  namely  conflicts and wars  and the impact that they have on the rights and dignity of individuals and communities. We are all aware of the direct impact of those issues on peace  security  development  justice and democracy throughout the world.   We wish to stress the resolutions and the important work of the United Nations between the two sessions  namely conferences and summits dealing with the information society and the HIV/AIDS pandemic  as well as meetings on development  alleviating poverty  protecting the environment  promoting the advancement of women  and dealing with unemployment and the issues of migration.  How we meet the need for development  security and peace throughout the world will depend on how we deal with the issues of violence and terrorism. Since the phenomenon of terrorism is universal in nature  the solution to it must also be found through a global vision that is anchored in understanding and dialogue between civilizations and nations  a vision that rejects confrontation and conflict and seeks to overcome poverty  illiteracy and social  scientific and technical underdevelopment.  In Mauritania we reject terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We remain faithful to our Islamic values of solidarity  understanding and tolerance  which reject violence and extremism.  My country  Mauritania  reiterates its support for peace and for relaunching the negotiation process on all tracks. That is the only way to put an end to the conflict in the Middle East  on the basis of international resolutions  the Arab Peace Initiative and the Road Map  which will guarantee the Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories in Palestine  Syria and Lebanon and allow the Palestinian people to restore its legitimate rights and establish an independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.  With regard to Western Sahara  Mauritania supports the measures taken by the United Nations and its Secretary-General to find a lasting solution that guarantees stability in that region and enjoys the support of all stakeholders.  Concerning Iraq  we are following very closely the changing political  security and humanitarian situation in that fraternal country. We note with satisfaction the success achieved by the Iraqi Government in rebuilding State institutions. We reaffirm our support for the unity of Iraq  its territorial integrity and independence and for non-interference in its internal affairs.  After the changes of 3 August 2005  the Islamic Republic of Mauritania ushered in a new era in its political history. The new era started with the creation of a pluralist  democratic system based on the guarantee of equality and justice for all. It enshrines the peaceful assumption of authority and transparency in management and administrative reform  while firmly establishing the mechanisms of good governance.  These choices have been implemented on the basis of a sound experiment carried out throughout the country using all the active forces of our people  including civil institutions  political parties  trade unions and the transition Government  through a programme of action for justice and democracy that has been implemented with the informed and effective participation of all stakeholders. It includes constitutional reform  reform of the administration of justice  administrative reform to combat corruption  and reform of the electoral system by creating an independent national electoral commission on the basis of transparency and by encouraging the participation of women.  In order to ensure total neutrality in the elections  the Military Council for Justice and Democracy has decreed that the President  members of the Military Council  the Prime Minister and members of the civilian transition Government are ineligible to take part in future municipal  legislative and presidential elections.  The absence of real democracy  free choice and fair elections led the Military Council for Justice and Democracy to intervene to end the political stalemate that the country was experiencing before 3 August 2005.  Here  on behalf of the Mauritanian people  I would like to thank sincerely all fraternal and friendly countries and international organizations and bodies that have supported our reform process and helped and supported us through its various stages.  Mauritania is keen to contribute to strengthening the links of fraternity  cooperation and solidarity in its region  in line with the common aspirations of our    06-52988 30  peoples. Within this framework  we affirm our unswerving faith in building an Arab Maghreb as a strategic  non-negotiable choice.  We are also profoundly attached to the spirit of fraternity and solidarity on our African continent and to the close relations that link our country to all fraternal African countries. Our country will continue to be faithful to strengthening the basis for dialogue  exchange and understanding between peoples and civilizations  particularly within the 5+5 forum and the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean process.  The major changes that have taken place on the international scene in recent years require a review and reform of the organs and method of work of the United Nations — in particular  by revitalizing the role of the General Assembly and ensuring respect for its resolutions  by reactivating the Economic and Social Council and by making the Security Council more representative. All this should aim to take account not only of important regions in the world  such as Africa and Latin America  or important regional groups  but also of industrialized countries that make major contributions to the United Nations  such as Germany and Japan.  We also believe that the Security Council today must improve its methods of work so that it can fulfill its task of maintaining international peace and security.  In closing  I would like to express the wish that the work of this session will be crowned with success. "
"121",4914,"MUS",61,2006,"I would like to express my sincere congratulations  and those of my delegation  to you  Madam President  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.  My delegation wishes to commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the leadership and courage he has displayed during his tenure at the helm of the Secretariat. Secretary-General Annan assumed office at a time when the United Nations was facing severe criticism and its very relevance was being questioned. His dedication and professionalism have contributed significantly towards enhancing the efficiency and credibility of our Organization and its Secretariat. His initiatives to promote the development agenda of the United Nations have been of crucial importance  in particular to Africa. As the Secretary-General prepares to relinquish his office in the next few weeks  we thank him warmly and wish him well in all his future endeavours.  Since our last annual meeting  several ongoing conflicts have remained unresolved and new ones have emerged. The situation in the Middle East continues to be a major preoccupation for the international community. While violence is still raging in Iraq and peace still eludes the Palestinian people  the recent conflict involving Israel and Hizbullah has not only cost so many innocent lives but has also resulted in the wanton destruction of vital infrastructure within Lebanon. Now that the guns have finally fallen silent  we urge all concerned in this unnecessary month-long conflict to abide fully by the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and to settle their outstanding issues through United Nations mediation.  There seems to be a unanimous view in the world today that the Middle East remains the epicentre of global insecurity and instability. Global peace and prosperity will remain an elusive dream unless and until the international community stretches all its diplomatic sinews to create conditions for lasting peace in the region. Mauritius strongly believes that a fair and final peace settlement in the Israel-Palestine conflict rests in the early implementation of the existing road map that has been endorsed by the international community.  We reiterate our support for an independent and sovereign Palestinian State existing side by side with the State of Israel.  The situation in Darfur remains a matter of serious concern not only to us in Africa but to the international community as a whole. We are confident that Security Council resolution 1706 (2006) has the capacity to lend strong support to the efforts already deployed by the African Union to put an end to that crisis.  Terrorism continues to be a major disruption for peace and development. The recent adoption of resolution 60/288 — the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy — sends a clear message that terrorism is unacceptable no matter who commits it  no matter where it takes place and no matter what the reason. Mauritius unreservedly condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. But let us not delude ourselves into thinking that we can address the scourge of terrorism without addressing its root causes.  Fifteen years ago  the Assembly initiated discussions on the reform of the Security Council. Numerous proposals have been made since then. Each proposal  whatever its merits  has met determined resistance from some members defending their own narrowly defined interests. It is unacceptable that the African and Latin America and the Caribbean regions are not represented in the permanent membership of the Security Council. It is also morally and politically unacceptable that the world’s most populous democracy is still denied a seat as a permanent member of the Council. It is imperative that a reformed Security   13 06-53317  Council should include India among its permanent members.  The establishment of the Human Rights Council constitutes a significant step in the implementation of our common reform agenda. That new organ of the General Assembly should perform efficiently so as to establish itself as a credible universal institution for the promotion and protection of human rights. My delegation would like to thank the General Assembly for electing Mauritius as one of the 47 members of the Council at the elections held earlier this year. We will do our utmost for the universal promotion and protection of human rights in accordance with the mandate conferred upon the Council by the Assembly.  The multilateral approach to disarmament has been on the back burner for some time. It is unfortunate that little progress has been achieved in respect of strengthening the foundations of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Mauritius supports the aim of the total elimination of all nuclear weapons on the basis of a comprehensive and non-discriminatory disarmament regime.  My delegation wishes to draw the attention of the Assembly to the fact that  38 years after its independence  Mauritius has still not been able to exercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago  including Diego Garcia. The Archipelago was excised from the territory of Mauritius by the former colonial Power to be subsequently used for military purposes behind our back  in total disregard of Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) and 2066 (XX). That exercise also involved the shameful displacement of the inhabitants of the Chagos from their homeland  thereby denying them their fundamental human rights. International law must prevail  as must respect for the sovereignty of all countries. We therefore call once again on the United Kingdom to pursue constructive dialogue in earnest with my Government  with a view to enabling Mauritius to exercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.  We view positively the visit jointly organized by the Governments of Mauritius and of the United Kingdom in April this year to enable the former inhabitants of the Chagos to visit the Archipelago for the first time since their displacement to pay respects at their relatives’ graves on the Archipelago.  We hope to continue meaningful dialogue with France on the question of sovereignty over Tromelin  given our excellent bilateral relations. We view the agreement reached in Paris at the expert level in January 2006 to set up a French-Mauritian joint commission for the co-management of the Tromelin zone as a positive first step.  My delegation is pleased that you  Madam President  have chosen development as the focus of your presidency. We welcome your proposal to dedicate this session of the General Assembly to the issue of implementing a global partnership for development. The biggest dilemma is how to secure the necessary financial flows towards developing countries. We call on the international community to honour commitments made to developing countries concerning official development assistance. Equally  we hope for conditions that will allow better access to the markets of the more affluent countries to generate resources for development.  Our meeting today coincides with the end of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty. The progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals  including halving the proportion of people suffering extreme poverty by 2015  has been below expectations  as reflected in human development indices. Poverty continues to prevail from generation to generation in many parts of the world  in particular in the sub-Saharan region. The political  social and economic marginalization or exclusion of poor people very often undermines the stability and development potential of many countries.  Does that imply that conventional solutions have failed because they do not really address the root causes of persistent poverty? Or is it because instead of taking a bottom-up approach we have adopted a top-down approach  relying too much on the trickle-down effect? The fight against poverty is becoming more and more complex. Only a holistic and comprehensive approach will allow us to push back the frontier of the misery  conflict and hardship that afflict such a sizeable proportion of humankind.  In our own subregion  we have initiated measures to address the issue of poverty in earnest. At the recent Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit  held in Lesotho in August  we debated the issue of poverty alleviation. An extraordinary SADC summit on regional integration  scheduled for next month  will discuss a road map on poverty and development.    06-53317 14   There is an almost symbiotic relationship between poverty and ill health  with disease often further impoverishing the poor and impacting negatively on the stock of scarce human capital in poor countries. Apart from malaria  HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis — and now avian flu — which are getting a lot of attention  other vector-borne diseases have manifested themselves  and are growing in an exponential manner.   The alarming rate with which the HIV/AIDS pandemic is ravaging our populations has far-reaching implications for our socio-economic development. It impedes our global efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We appreciate the political commitment of the international community to combat this scourge so as to bring solace to those already afflicted and to prevent the further spread of the disease. Mauritius promptly and spontaneously joined the innovative financing mechanism initiated by France and Brazil to introduce a solidarity levy on air tickets to fight HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. The launching this week of UNITAID — the International Drug Purchase Facility — has aroused new hopes.  Climate change is yet another serious threat. For too long  some of us have conveniently decided to ignore it. In fact  well-known institutions and eminent scientists have reached the conclusion that climate change may be one of the biggest threats to humankind. Of particular concern is the impact of global warming on certain vectors of disease  leading to their proliferation. It is estimated that in Africa  for example  we may witness many more millions of cases of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases as a result of climate change.  Mauritius is fully committed to the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round. We look forward to a multilateral trading system that will be fair and equitable and that provides for the specific situations and needs of small and vulnerable economies. The recommendations of the World Trade Organization Aid for Trade Task Force  submitted in July 2006  should be implemented urgently to enable countries  particularly those with small and vulnerable economies  to access resources to undertake adjustment and restructuring programmes and to enhance their trade infrastructure and supply capacities.  Globalization does not seem to be living up to its promises. We should not allow it to be a process that unleashes the potential of the few while suppressing the aspirations of the many. It will have to be tamed into a development process that will provide an opportunity to every single citizen of the world to achieve his or her full potential.  Mauritius  like so many small island economies with meagre resource bases  has had to adjust to the realities and challenges of increasing liberalization and global economic competition — especially the erosion of trade preferences  which have so far helped in addressing our inherent disadvantages. My Government has embarked upon a programme of bold and wide-ranging economic reforms to adapt to the new realities of the international economy.  At the end of the day  what is the ultimate role that each of us here has as heads of State and heads of Government? We have been entrusted with the destiny of our people and of our countries. We are but temporary custodians of the welfare of our people and that of humankind. If we really want to build better societies and a better world for future generations  we must indeed make a significant dent on the issue of poverty. We must channel significant resources and energy towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals. And we must ensure that we create stable and sustainable societies.   To achieve that  we can no longer afford to simply keep talking about noble intentions. We must walk the walk  not just talk the talk. Each one of us here has the responsibility to implement national policies that provide opportunities for those who have always been deprived of their human dignity as a result of living perpetually on the margins of the socio-economic mainstream.  My Government is guided by the notion of citizenship with dignity as a moral compass for action. We believe that socio-economic justice is a fundamental pillar of human dignity. We are therefore determined to provide concrete opportunities to the economically disenfranchised  in order to lift them out of the vortex of unjust economic inequalities. I have always upheld the ideals of social justice. I have therefore ensured that my Government dedicates no less than 12 per cent of our last national budget to an ambitious empowerment programme. That programme is funded by State and non-State actors  thereby heralding a new partnership for development in my country. It will provide tangible avenues for the poor   15 06-53317  and unskilled to equip themselves with the tools necessary for them to join the economic mainstream. It also seeks to create a new and flourishing class of entrepreneurs. That is one of the effective and concrete ways by which we can truly ensure that we widen the circle of opportunities. (spoke in French)  Resolving the problems to which I have referred to a large extent requires openness  responsiveness  dialogue and solidarity. We in Mauritius have the good fortune of being situated in a major crossroads as far as philosophies and religions are concerned. The history of the settlement of our islands has made that the case. We are the children of several traditions. Our identity has been shaped by various influences  from the East  West  North and South. Numerous ethnic groups  cultures  religions and languages have been evolving in our territory  and we are endeavouring to ensure that they enrich each other. We seek the commingling of cultures  which provides us Mauritians with a complex and dynamic identity. We believe that that is the best way to build a nation and to assert ourselves. As one can imagine  that situation requires ongoing vigilance on the part of political  religious and media leaders as well as rigorous and transparent application of the principles of justice.   We would like to believe that the experience of Mauritius can be applied at the international level. We also hope that dialogue between peoples and communities and communication between heads of State and Government will bring about the end of the disagreements that are today undermining our world  which is the only one we have.

"122",4951,"MWI",61,2006,"I take this opportunity  Madam President  to warmly congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. My delegation welcomes your leadership and assures you of our unwavering support as you carry out your duties. We are confident that under your able leadership the reform programmes of the United Nations will be advanced.  I also take this opportunity to thank your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the leadership he provided in steering the affairs of the sixtieth session. My delegation noted with satisfaction the service he rendered  and also noted that under his presidency positive advances were made towards the reform of the United Nations.  Malawi welcomes the admission of the Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United Nations. Malawi wishes President Filip Vujanovic and the people of the Republic of Montenegro continued peace and prosperity as they chart the way forward and take their place in the United Nations.  At the end of this year we bid farewell to Mr. Kofi Annan  who has served as Secretary-General for two consecutive terms. I am happy to join previous speakers in paying tribute to Mr. Annan for the dynamic leadership he has provided to the United Nations during his tenure of office.  Mr. Annan had many achievements  but perhaps one of the greatest was his ability to remain calm and well focused under great pressure. During his tenure of office the United Nations faced daunting challenges  including the fight against famine  hunger and natural disasters in many parts of the world; civil wars in Africa and conflicts in the Middle East and the Gulf region; international terrorism; and the fight against HIV/AIDS. It is therefore with great pleasure that  on behalf of the people of Malawi  and on my own behalf  I honour and pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his sterling service to the United Nations. I trust that he    06-52988 2  will continue to be of service to humanity in other capacities.  The theme of this year’s session  “Implementing a global partnership for development ” is very pertinent  because during the 2005 session we renewed the mandate of the United Nations to meet the challenges of the millennium  such as eradicating global poverty and injustice  and the promotion of democracy  human rights  peace  security and stability in Member nations. We asserted that these are essential ingredients for sustainable economic and social development and that they are interlinked and mutually reinforcing in the quest for the betterment and well-being of humanity as a whole.  I believe that in the search for global partnership for development the greatest challenge that the United Nations faces is to eradicate the poverty that engulfs the majority of humanity.  I believe that global peace  security and stability cannot be assured if the greater section of humanity lives in abject poverty. It is our hope that those who have will learn to share with those who do not have.  In order to present to the Assembly the need for a global partnership framework as a way to achieve a faster and sustainable rate of economic growth  let me use my own country as an example. In Malawi we have determined priorities to fast track socio-economic growth for the people. We are cognizant that in a poor nation like ours everything becomes a priority  but we have agreed on a set of “priorities within priorities” that we want to implement in the next five years. These are agriculture and food security  irrigation and water development  transport and communications infrastructure  energy  integrated rural development and the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS. We believe that  when fully implemented  these sectors will  together  pull our people out of poverty.  We have given the highest priority to agriculture and food security because this sector is a mainstay of our economy and we intend to make Malawi a hunger-free nation. We are assisting smallholder and peasant farmers to increase their productivity in food and cash crops by providing cheap fertilizers and high-quality farm inputs. This will provide food security as well as expand agro-processing industries  and it will mean adding value to our products. We seek international support in this area.  Secondly  we need international partnership in irrigation and water development. This would reduce our country’s dependence on rain-fed agriculture. We aim at having small-  medium- and large-scale irrigation schemes and the construction of multi-purpose dams throughout the country. This will enable Malawi to produce enough food even when rains fail.  Thirdly  we consider transport and communications infrastructure to be essential for growth and development and  indeed  a good candidate for international partnership. We are convinced that through well developed road networks we will not only improve movement of goods and services from rural areas to the urban centres  but also enhance domestic and international trade.  More importantly  Malawi seeks global partnership in opening up access to the Indian Ocean through the existing Shire-Zambezi waterway  which is navigable all the way from an inland port in Malawi to the port of Chinde  in Mozambique  on the Indian Ocean  only 238 kilometres away. This waterway would benefit Malawi and other southern African countries  especially Mozambique  Zambia  Rwanda  Burundi and Zimbabwe.  Fourthly  Malawi has selected energy as another area of international partnership. We believe that it is imperative for our country to develop adequate and reliable energy for agriculture  irrigation  transport  industry and all other areas of economic transformation.  Fifthly  Malawi would welcome international partnership in promoting integrated rural development aimed at eradicating poverty among the rural communities. We have recognized that the economic stratification of our country is such that the greater percentage of the people live in rural areas in squalid conditions. We seek donor support to boldly take development to rural areas through promoting rural growth centres.  Lastly  Malawi seeks international partnership in HIV/AIDS prevention and management. We recognize that our country on its own  without the full support of the international community  cannot successfully wage the battle against HIV/AIDS. I am happy to say that during the past two years Malawi has made tremendous progress in AIDS awareness campaigns  the supply of anti-retroviral drugs and voluntary testing.   3 06-52988   This is Malawi’s agenda for implementing a global partnership for development. I am submitting this agenda to the United Nations for support.  Before I end my statement  I need to mention two important issues.  First  through a global partnership  Malawi has reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. I and the people of Malawi are truly grateful that our multilateral debts have been cancelled by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We thank the [G-8 countries for spearheading the Initiative and for their commitment to it. We believe that this is a true example of global partnership in development.  The second issue that is germane to global partnership is for me to reiterate my plea for the readmission of the Republic of China – Taiwan — as a Member of the United Nations. Many of those present will agree that since the end of the cold war  and with the advent of globalization  Taiwan has quietly contributed to the work of the United Nations and its specialized agencies in various areas  including technology  medicine  research  industry and international trade. That contribution becomes increasingly important  especially within the principle of universality  equity and justice.  Let me conclude by drawing attention to the report entitled “In larger freedom: towards development  security and human rights for all”  by Mr. Kofi Annan  who stated:  “The right to choose how they are ruled  and who rules them  must be the birthright of all people  and its universal achievement must be a central objective of an Organization devoted to the cause of larger freedom.” (A/59/2005  para. 148)  To me  such larger freedom means the freedom of every nation to belong to the United Nations  the freedom from oppression of one nation by another  and freedom for every nation to contribute to the global partnership for development. These are the freedoms of the United Nations that should be cherished and upheld.  I therefore appeal to the Security Council to reconsider the fact that Taiwan should be granted observer status in the United Nations and its specialized agencies  pending a full review of its membership. I am convinced that continued denial of Taiwan’s participation in the community of nations poses a moral and legal challenge to the United Nations. "
"123",4997,"MYS",61,2006,"First  I wish to congratulate Ms. Haya Rasheed Al-Khalifa and the State of Bahrain on her election as the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. As an Asian  a Muslim and the current Chairman of the Summit Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference  I welcome her election with pride and satisfaction. I am confident that she will be able to steer the proceedings of the Assembly with consummate skill and achieve meaningful results. Needless to say  Malaysia will support her in any way that we can.  Allow me to also pay tribute to her distinguished predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  the Foreign Minister of Sweden  for the exemplary way in which he guided the proceedings of the Assembly’s sixtieth session  during some of the most trying times for the United Nations.  Speaking of trying times  I would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his tireless efforts in serving humanity  not only during his tenure as the Secretary-General but throughout an entire career dedicated to the ideals of our Organization.  I must pay a special tribute to the members of the Secretariat and those serving under the United Nations banner  in particular those who have made the ultimate sacrifice of their lives  like the four members of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon who were killed last July during the height of the Israeli offensive against Lebanon.  Mr. Mérorès (Haiti)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  We must continually remind ourselves that the United Nations was brought into being to serve as a forum  and  as in Tennyson’s words  to be a parliament of man. Six decades later  we have yet to achieve the intentions of the United Nations Charter. Indeed  the situation in some corners of the world is bleaker than it ever was before. Yet the human family is still unable to find solutions to its own problems.  As I review in my mind the events of the past year  I personally feel most disturbed that many of the ills in the affairs of our world were the result of irrational actions caused by prejudice in human attitudes. Basically  we have failed to engage in dialogue  communicate and reach out to one another as fellow humans inhabiting the same planet. Indeed  the greatest discord today exists among the descendants of Abraham. These are the People of the Book: the followers of Judaism  Christianity and Islam  who in fact share a common beginning  which was the religion of Abraham.  Of course  dialogue will be endless if it is not accompanied by action. The purpose of honest discussion and engagement is to enable us to formulate rational and effective policies. To achieve this  I believe that all of us need to listen well and be sincere in our relations with one another. Much of the dialogue that takes place results in the parties talking at  instead of talking to  one another. Any dialogue will certainly fail if it is predetermined that certain States are “rogues” or that certain countries are necessarily “evil”. Such name-calling provides an excuse not to listen  let alone engage in serious negotiations to find amicable solutions to serious problems.  A blatant example of the refusal to grant even a hearing was the early decision by many important countries not to recognize or do business with Hamas after that group was elected to power in Palestine through a properly conducted democratic election. External assistance was stopped. Funds were blocked. As a result  millions of Palestinians have suffered for months without pay or food. I hope that all sanctions against Palestine will soon be a matter of the past  when President Abbas succeeds in the task of putting together a coalition Government embracing all parties in Palestine. Surely  to dictate or show preferences as    06-52885 32  to who should be elected to power in other countries is irrational and a sign of double standards.  The oppression of Palestine  which is being allowed to fester; the invasion of Afghanistan; the conquest of Iraq; and  most recently  the unrestrained destruction of Lebanon have all been carried out in the name of the war against terrorism. The actions of Israel in the Middle East are being supported  either openly or tacitly  supposedly in defence of the Judeo-Christian tradition against the spread of radical militant Islam  thus legitimizing all those actions  no matter how brutal. Even Western commentators have conceded that Israel’s latest assault against Lebanon has helped make what may once have been extremist opinions part of the Muslim mainstream. The Muslim world certainly sees all this as complicity to humiliate Muslim countries and Muslim societies.  I am afraid that the schism between the West and the Muslim world will grow even deeper unless the international community is prepared to accept certain facts as the truth. The fact is that the sense of humiliation being felt by the Muslim world is the root cause for the loss of trust and confidence between the Muslim world  on the one side  and Judeo-Christian civilization  on the other. If the international community refuses or fails to accept this fact  then I am afraid we are denying the truth.  I believe that much of the prejudice against Muslims stems from a lack of understanding of the true nature of Islam and what it stands for. For instance  there is a lack of appreciation in the West of the role of religion in the lives of Muslims. Modern Europe has generally embraced secularism and has largely removed religion from the public domain  placing it in the confines of the home and family. For Muslims  the teachings of Islam serve as their guide for doing all things  whether conducting their affairs in the public domain or practicing the religion in their private homes. I suggest that many of the misunderstandings  especially those between the Christian West and the Muslim world  arise out of this fundamental misunderstanding of the place of religion in the daily lives of Muslims all over the world. When dealing with Muslims  one cannot separate them from their religion  because that is their way of life.  My country  Malaysia  is a multi-ethnic  multi-religious  multicultural country. However  Islam is respected by all our people as the official religion. The Government which I now lead has embarked on a programme to communicate a proper appreciation of Islam as a force for good. We call it Islam Hadhari  which is an approach for achieving a progressive society that is compatible with modernity yet firmly rooted in the noble values and injunctions of Islam. This approach has been accepted by everyone in Malaysia because underlying the whole message of Islam Hadhari is a call for equitable development and progress. It is a call for moderation and tolerance as well as the assurance of justice and fairness for all  irrespective of their faith.  The point I am making is that Islam the religion is not the source of intolerance between people of different faiths. In fact  one of the fundamental teachings of Islam is the requirement to respect other religions. The Holy Koran contains that commandment by God. We must not confuse the perverse words and evil deeds of a small number of extremists who operate on the fringes of Muslim societies as a reflection of Islamic culture. The demonization of Islam must be stopped and Islamophobia must be removed. The politics of fear must cease to dictate the conduct of relations between peoples and nations. If the politics of fear is not stopped  then prejudice and irrationality will continue to prevail in the affairs of the world  and dialogue will continue to fail.  However  we must persevere  not only to eliminate political and religious discord among men  but also to eradicate social and economic injustices  particularly poverty and disease. That is an international responsibility  not only in the name of humanity  but also as a necessary aspect of maintaining international peace and stability.  We must therefore do all we can to ensure that the impoverished and marginalized also enjoy the fruits of economic growth  globalization and free trade. It would indeed be unfortunate if we were unable to do so  because the world has become more wealthy than ever before. We should learn from history that any economic system in which disparities exist cannot be sustained in the long term. All too often  such societies come to a violent end. The civil wars and social unrest we witness today mark a phase that we must stop.  Malaysia firmly believes that the key to prosperity  inclusion and equity is sustained economic growth based on the building of national capacities  particularly human capital development. While   33 06-52885  education and skills by themselves are no guarantee of success  they are indispensable ingredients for the greater productivity of individual citizens  which in turn gives them hope for a better future.  However  efforts at the national level alone are not sufficient. Those efforts need to be supplemented by the establishment of an international economic order that would cover areas such as trade  finance  debt  official development assistance (ODA) and development  and that would enable the developing world to overcome its difficulties and contribute to global prosperity. Some progress has been made  but the overall results have been far from satisfactory.  Given the economic clout that the developed countries possess  it is essential that they demonstrate flexibility and goodwill at this critical juncture in the world trade talks. Malaysia will continue to be supportive of multilateral trade negotiations. Malaysia’s approach will  however  never be premised simply on the notion of progressive liberalization. We will continue to take a pragmatic approach by combining liberalization with regulation in a policy mix consistent with the country’s economic conditions and development needs.  It is all too clear that our human family must come together and that its members must talk to one another if we are to overcome the problems that threaten to engulf us all. To talk  however  is easy; to engage in dialogue and to communicate is more difficult. Indeed  this may be the most difficult of all human endeavours  given the human temperament with all its passions and foibles. It will require courage  humility and an appreciation of the diversities that make us human.   We must not be patronizing or condescending in our relationships  and we must certainly not be threatening. We must be persuasive and patient in dealing with complexities. The pursuit of peace  justice and fairness in relations among nations and peoples has never been easy. Let us take up this challenge  with all the fortitude that it requires  and together put into effect a better world. "
"124",5024,"NAM",61,2006,"I should like at the outset to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa on her well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty first session. I am confident that  given her wisdom and experience  she will steer the proceedings of the Assembly successfully. I also express our profound appreciation to her predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  for his excellent work during the sixtieth session.  In the same vein  we salute the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his dedication and commitment to the work of the United Nations. My delegation would like to pay him special tribute for his distinguished leadership and remarkable contribution to the United Nations  taking into consideration his imminent departure at the end of a long  dedicated and brilliant career in the service of our Organization. Under his leadership  the United Nations has recorded significant achievements. He ably laid the foundation for Member States to make further progress  especially with regard to the reform of the United Nations. We will carry on with this task  bearing in mind his vision of sustained global cooperation among States. Allow me to wish him the very best in his future engagements.  We are gathered here to reaffirm our faith in the United Nations and to recommit ourselves to the purposes and principles of the Charter. Today  the world needs a stronger United Nations and effective multilateralism that reflects current realities. Only thus will humanity be able to respond in a timely manner and without hesitation to the global challenges that we face.  We fully support the comprehensive reform of the United Nations as proposed by the Secretary-General. The reforms should aim at strengthening the Organization and making it more efficient  effective and responsive to the needs of all its Members. We further attach great importance to strengthening the role and authority of the General Assembly as the main deliberative and policy-making body  whose relationship with other principal organs should be placed in a fitting context so as to ensure cooperation and respect for their roles as provided for in the Charter.  My Government believes that the reform of the Security Council  including its expansion  is essential. The African continent deserves to be fairly and equitably represented in the Council. That is not too much to ask.  During the World Summit in September last year  we reaffirmed our commitment to the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2)  adopted more than six years ago. The Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) reiterated our commitments to the implementation of the decisions made during previous conferences and summits. My Government appreciates the work done under the guidance and able leadership of former President Eliasson in the realization of the Summit decisions.    06-52885 18   The fruits of those efforts are visible to us all  as they culminated in the inauguration of the Peacebuilding Commission  the creation of the Human Rights Council  the creation of the Central Emergency Response Fund and the establishment of the Ethics Office. We also welcome the accomplishments in the area of management reform. People around the world have high hopes that these newly created instruments will achieve the specific mandates set for them. We therefore encourage all Member States to continue  in an open and transparent manner  to finalize the review of the process.  Namibia attaches importance to the global development agenda. Thus we are concerned about the slow pace at which this essential matter is being handled and about the lack of adherence to the commitments in line with the Millennium Declaration. In this regard  I urge all fellow leaders to stand together in finding effective solutions to push back the ever-encroaching frontiers of poverty  hunger  disease and ignorance.  The African people know that they must take a lead in resolving problems and challenges on the continent. In those endeavours  they need to form effective partnerships with the international community. I therefore welcome the commitments made by the Group and Eight last year in Scotland to consider increasing development aid to Africa  to cancel the debt owed by the poorest countries and to promote universal access to antiretroviral drugs for HIV/AIDS by the year 2010.  We reiterate our call for cooperation among the United Nations  its specialized agencies and the African Union and its subregional organizations dealing with economic and social development on the continent. We continue to emphasize the importance of the Economic and Social Council as a central intergovernmental body for promoting a more integrated approach to global peace and development.  Namibia welcomes the presidential and parliamentary elections recently held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  which  most international observers agree  were conducted in a peaceful and transparent atmosphere. We urge the United Nations and the international community at large to continue to support the people of the Democratic Republic during this crucial democratic transition.  The situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan is cause for serious concern. The African Union  through the African Union Mission in Sudan and with the assistance of the international community  has made efforts to bring peace to that region under exceptionally hard conditions. We commend the African Union Special Envoy  Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim  for his tireless efforts in bringing the parties to an agreement. We urge all the parties to respect their commitments.   We welcome the visit to the Sudan by the United Nations Security Council team in June this year and the recommendations they made. Namibia looks forward to an urgent and smooth transition from the African Union Mission to a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur in accordance with Security Council resolution 1706 (2006). We urge the Government of the Sudan and other parties concerned to accept this transition  which we believe will be in the best interest of the people of the Sudan in general and those of the Darfur region in particular.  I would like to join other countries around the world in expressing our concern about the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  which remains a menace to humanity. The proliferation of such weapons compromises peace and security. They also pose serious challenges to law enforcement agencies around the world.  We are concerned that the question of Western Sahara remains unresolved. The inalienable rights of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence must be upheld and respected  as stipulated in the relevant United Nations resolutions. We therefore call for the urgent implementation of all relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions  with the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara.  Namibia is also deeply concerned about the ongoing suffering of the people of Palestine. We wish to reaffirm our full and unequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and national independence. In this context  we appeal to the United Nations to assume its full responsibility by implementing all its resolutions and decisions on Palestine  with immediate effect and without precondition.  Sadly  the people of Lebanon have once again been subjected to war and indiscriminate bombing    19 06-52885  which have caused enormous suffering and the deaths of innocent people  including children and the elderly  as well as severe damage to and destruction of property and infrastructure. Against that background  we call for the immediate and unconditional implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and appeal to the international community to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Lebanon in dealing with the resulting humanitarian crisis.  For many years now  the majority of Member States in this Assembly have expressed concern over the continuous economic  commercial and financial embargo against Cuba  which continues to cause severe hardships for the Cuban people. The Government of the Republic of Namibia upholds the principles of peaceful coexistence of nations and fair and open trade among nations. Thus  we call on all Member States  in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations  for an immediate and unconditional lifting of the embargo against the Republic of Cuba  as called for in General Assembly resolution 60/12 and many previous resolutions.  In June 2006  the General Assembly convened a High-level Meeting on the implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. That Meeting served as an important opportunity for Member States to assess progress and further strengthen and expand responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Before the High-level Meeting  the African Union had adopted an African Common Position at a special session in Abuja in May 2006. Namibia is fully committed to the implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. We are  equally  grateful for the support for the call to mobilize resources and to forge a stronger partnership in confronting the pandemic. We stress the need for universal and affordable access to comprehensive service packages for all those infected.  In our ongoing efforts to reform and strengthen the United Nations  making it more effective and responsive to today’s challenges — poverty and hunger  the HIV/AIDS pandemic  civil wars and the war on terror — we should place human lives and human dignity at the centre of all our efforts. The reform we have embarked upon should be seen as a process and should be undertaken in a spirit of mutual understanding and with a sense of collective ownership. Let us strive to re-energize the United Nations and make it an Organization that we can all be proud of  so that we can make planet Earth a common home for all humanity to live in peace  stability and prosperity. "
"125",5069,"NER",61,2006,"Allow me to express the warmest congratulations of the delegation of Niger to Ms. Al-Khalifa upon her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. She is the third woman in the history of the United Nations called upon to take up this office  and her election is richly symbolic on several counts. In her we have a seasoned diplomat of great competence and sure qualities that augur well for the positive results that we will see under her presidency.   We also congratulate her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the Assembly at its sixtieth session  for the remarkable work he accomplished during his presidency.   Finally  allow me to reiterate the congratulations of the Republic of Niger to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who will be leaving the Organization after ten years of intense activity  ingenious initiatives and staunch devotion. There can be no doubt that the vigour he brought to the Organization  the important reforms he launched and the new bodies that have been created during his mandate stand out in the annals of the United Nations.  More than ever before  the international community is confronted by challenges to peace and security. Despite noteworthy progress in this area and despite multiple efforts  horror and despair continue to reach us from certain areas of conflict.   Some positive developments have certainly been recorded in Africa in the area of conflict resolution  notably in the Democratic Republic of Congo  Burundi  Liberia and Sierra Leone. Those developments remind us that we need an operational and effective decision-making mechanism so that we can quickly deal with any threat to international peace and security  irrespective of its complexity. Only substantial reform of the Security Council  along with revitalization of the General Assembly  can enhance legitimacy and effectiveness  especially if it takes into account equitable representation accompanied by an improvement in working methods. For Niger  only equitable enlargement of the Security Council can improve its functioning and make it possible to establish the bases for decisions that will be acceptable to and accepted by everyone.  In Côte d’Ivoire  the United Nations must redouble its efforts to reach a definition of a new transition in consultation with all parties  ECOWAS and the African Union so that the matter can be dealt with calmly after 31 October 2006.  The situation in the Middle East — especially in Lebanon  which has held the attention of the international community over recent weeks — proves  if proof were needed  that the United Nations is still the prime forum for promoting negotiations on preserving international peace and security.  The same degree of attention should be paid to the resurgence of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. The establishment of a comprehensive peace in the subregion involves going back to the negotiating table in order to make progress in implementing the road map towards the creation of a sovereign and viable Palestinian State  in conformity with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.  With regard to Western Sahara  the United Nations must pursue and intensify its efforts with a view to finding a definitive solution to the question. As to Jammu and Kashmir  the Niger encourages India and Pakistan to continue with their talks.  Another serious threat to international peace and security is posed by nuclear weapons. In this regard  the Niger would like to reaffirm its support for the    06-53005 48  commitments made within the framework of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)  while recognizing the importance and the usefulness of research for peaceful purposes. However  the increasingly marked division which this issue engenders requires an appropriate response in the ongoing quest for consensus through the current negotiations.   The Niger welcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  which is one of the first concrete achievements to emerge from the World Summit. We should give it our full support so that it can provide effective assistance to countries in post-conflict situations. In my capacity as a representative of the country currently holding the chairmanship of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  a region which is still ravaged by conflicts  I am happy to report on the progress that has been made in our subregion in the area of conflict prevention and resolution. Sierra Leone  Liberia and Guinea-Bissau  which I referred to just now  today are countries in a post-conflict situation. They therefore need to be effectively helped in order to consolidate their return to peace and to create the conditions for an environment that is favourable to their economic and social development. In order to maintain the ban on the circulation of illegal weapons  which  as every one knows  have stoked many conflicts in our subregion  the heads of State and Government of the member countries of ECOWAS have decided to convert the moratorium on small arms and light weapons into a legally binding convention  in order to strengthen the capacity of Member States to fight effectively against this scourge.  The Niger also welcomes the establishment of the new Human Rights Council. This body merits the approval and backing of all Member States  which should fully cooperate with it. For its part  the Niger undertakes to do everything in its power to participate effectively in its activities.  In another area  the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) will certainly help us to exercise greater control over such scourges as food insecurity and cyclical droughts  which have caused so much damage and have plunged a substantial portion of the populations of some West African countries into an unacceptably precarious situation owing to the slow reaction of the international community. For the Niger  as well as for other countries of the subregion  the human development index would have been higher if development cooperation had seen qualitative and quantitative increases in line with the commitments contained in the Monterrey Consensus with regard to official development assistance (ODA) and other initiatives on the subject.  The debates at the current session are particularly important for the Niger because they come one year after the historic Summit of 2005. The High-level Plenary Meeting which prepared the above Summit already stressed the importance of partnerships  particularly with respect to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In this regard  the central theme of the sixty-first session  namely  the implementation of a global partnership for development  is very appropriate because it illustrates perfectly the need and the importance of a multilateral and collective approach in order to find the most appropriate solutions to the current problems in the world.   I would like here  on behalf of the Niger  to commend the initiatives taken to find new sources of funding in order to provide an initial response to the insufficiency of resources noted during the evaluation of the 2005 Summit. I would particularly like to welcome the International Drug Purchase Facility (UNITAID) initiative launched by the French Government to finance the fight against AIDS and malaria. The Niger is one of the first 17 countries to have endorsed the tax on airline tickets.  It is also within the framework of this kind of partnership that the positive nature of international migration could be stressed and could be included in our search for appropriate responses  which would take into account the concerns of the countries of origin  transit and destination.  I would like to end my statement by pointing out that  for the Niger  the effective implementation of the actions planned to deal with global issues must be multilateral in character and must assign a central role to the United Nations system.  And here I would reiterate the faith that the Niger has in the United Nations  not only because the Organization remains the most appropriate framework and the most relevant multilateral mechanism with which to promote development  but also because it pursues the noble causes which it embodies. The   49 06-53005  United Nations therefore must be revitalized in order to be in a position to satisfy the deepest aspirations of the peoples and nations of the world  particularly those that are weakest.

"126",5115,"NGA",61,2006,"I bring you  Madam President  good tidings from Chief Olusegun Obasanjo  President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  who could not be here in person as a result of a national tragedy. He has asked me to deliver his statement to the Assembly and it is now my privilege and honour to read it out.   “On behalf of the people and the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to you  Madam  and your country  the Kingdom of Bahrain  on your historic election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your assumption of that high office is a source of inspiration to us all  particularly to women all   11 06-53329  over the world. I assure you of the support and cooperation of my delegation.   “I would like to extend my profound appreciation to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the commitment and dedication with which he presided over the affairs of the sixtieth session. This was particularly evident during the delicate negotiations that resulted in the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the creation of the Human Rights Council.   “The founding fathers of the United Nations envisaged an international organization whose primary strength would rest on the ability of its Members to act collectively and in a spirit of cooperation in solving international problems.   “The theme for this year’s general debate  ‘Implementing a global partnership for development’  aptly captures this aspiration and  indeed  reaffirms one of the objectives of the Millennium Development Goals. Nigeria restates its firm commitment to the principle that genuine global partnership is the key to development. This is particularly so in the face of the many challenges confronting us today.   “For Africa  the most urgent challenge remains the resolution of conflicts and the maintenance of peace and security as the foundation for socio-economic progress. We remain undaunted and have collectively decided to take action to address the problem under the auspices of the African Union. Our efforts have been bolstered by the active engagement of the Security Council and the international community  for which we remain grateful. I am happy to note that in Liberia and Sierra Leone  where hostilities have happily ceased  there are signs of progress everywhere as democracy and its benefits take their most important first steps.   “With respect to Côte d’Ivoire  Nigeria welcomes the recent efforts by all parties to overcome their differences through dialogue. We urge them to remain steadfast in their commitment in order to ensure that the peace process remains on course. However  it is now doubtful that elections can take place in October. But we must not allow the elections in Côte d’Ivoire to be postponed beyond 31 December 2006. If the proposed extraordinary meeting of the Economic Community of West African States in early October fails to achieve this goal  a Security Council resolution will become necessary to impose heavy sanctions on all culprits and their relations.   “Nigeria is encouraged by the progress towards implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement  which was signed in Abuja last June. We are  however  concerned by the slow pace of implementation regarding key aspects of the plan  which has exacerbated the humanitarian situation. We share the frustration of the international community over the lack of access to vulnerable groups in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. We call on all parties to respect their commitments.   “The situation in Darfur has placed a heavy burden on the African Union and continues to exert pressure on its meagre resources  as it struggles to maintain a peacekeeping force of over 7 000 troops. Africa’s commitment to peace in Darfur was reaffirmed by the latest decision of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union  at its meeting in New York on 20 September 2006  to extend the mandate of the African Mission in the Sudan (AMIS) until 31 December 2006. Nigeria calls on the international community to urgently assist the African Union with the logistical and financial support to sustain AMIS through that date.   “If the early removal of the obstacles that have thus far prevented the conclusion of the negotiations on the replacement of the African Union force with a United Nations peacekeeping force cannot be achieved  the African Union may be left with no other option but to allow the troops to return to the contributing countries. The consequences of the withdrawal of AMIS without a United Nations umbrella will be the full responsibility of the Government of the Sudan.   “Nigeria is concerned by the increasing threat of violence and insecurity in the world brought about by threats or acts of terrorism. Nigeria strongly condemns all acts of terrorism and calls upon the international community to redouble its efforts to defeat this heinous crime in all its forms and manifestations.    06-53329 12    “On the situation in the Middle East  Nigeria welcomes Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and calls for the implementation of the terms of the ceasefire by both parties. We believe  however  that a long-lasting solution must come through dialogue and a readiness to abandon violence as a means of resolving the crisis. The root causes of the Middle East crisis must also be addressed in a comprehensive manner for lasting peace to be attained. We reaffirm our commitment to a two-State arrangement: Israel and Palestine living in peace within secure borders  in accordance with Security Council resolutions. We therefore call on the international community to show greater commitment to the peaceful and early resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis.   “West Africa has experienced conflicts for many years as a result of the illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons in the region. We believe that the restoration and maintenance of peace are critical for socio-economic development in the subregion. Towards that end  in June this year  States member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) adopted a landmark Convention on Small Arms  Light Weapons  Their Ammunition and Other Associated Material to reduce violence in the subregion and pave the way for the achievement of peace  security  stability  cooperation and development. The Convention bans international arms transfers  except those for the legitimate defence and security needs of member States. Of greatest significance is the ban on transfers to non-State actors  who have been largely responsible for political instability in the subregion  as elsewhere.   “In this regard  I wish to express Nigeria’s deep disappointment that the first United Nations Review Conference on implementation of the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons failed to agree on a final document  including a similar ban on arms transfers to non-State actors. I urge all Member States to be guided by the example of ECOWAS on this issue when and if the Conference reconvenes.   “As a demonstration of Nigeria’s commitment to the fight against illicit small arms  we have deposited the instrument of ratification of the Firearms Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. We also call for a comprehensive and legally binding global arms trade treaty.   “Humankind has made giant strides in the field of nuclear technology since the discovery of the atom. This has opened up vistas of opportunities for determined and committed societies to uplift the standard of living of their citizenry. Indeed  nuclear energy has become a veritable source of socio-economic development and a reliable source of electricity generation. We note in particular the global trend towards the utilization of nuclear technology for the generation of electricity  agricultural development  human health and environmental development  especially for developing countries.   “In the context of this development and of the enormous energy crisis that confronts us in Nigeria  my Government decided to inaugurate the Board of the Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission. With the inauguration of the Board  our quest for energy self-sufficiency has begun.   “Nigeria remains resolute in its commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Treaty of Pelindaba on the African nuclear-weapon-free zone. We wish to assure the international community of our determination to restrict the use of nuclear energy to purely peaceful purposes.   “I take this opportunity to reiterate our deep appreciation to this body for the invaluable support it has given to the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). We are also very appreciative of the interest shown by the international community and the commitments it has made in support of NEPAD. The NEPAD initiative remains our continent’s most viable socio-economic blueprint; it could bring sustained economic growth while strengthening good governance and enhancing the protection of the human rights of our peoples.   “Trade is one of the most potent and genuine engines of economic growth and development. We therefore support efforts that would enhance the ability of our countries to enjoy the benefits of the successful conclusion of agreements on regimes under the auspices of the   13 06-53329  World Trade Organization (WTO). In this connection  we regard the recent breakdown of the WTO Doha round of development talks as a very serious setback. The successful conclusion of Doha development talks and the implementation of their outcome would provide succour to the almost 1 billion people currently subsisting on less than one dollar a day. We urge all parties to return to the negotiating table and resume talks in the spirit of global partnership  cooperation and global economic progress.   “Nigeria remains committed to the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic  malaria  tuberculosis and related diseases. We have taken bold steps to deal with them. To this end  we hosted the Special Summit of the African Union on HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria in Abuja in May this year. At the Summit  African leaders reaffirmed their commitment to earlier declarations and pledged to take immediate action to ensure universal access to relevant drugs. We applaud the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS (resolution 60/262) which was adopted at the United Nations High-level Meeting on HIV/AIDS last June and hope that it will be fully implemented.   “On 14 August this year  Nigeria lowered its flag for the last time on the Bakassi peninsula and effectively withdrew its presence there in accordance with the ruling of the International Court of Justice. With this final act  Nigeria has fulfilled its obligations under the terms of the agreement between my country and Cameroon. I use this opportunity to recognize the positive contributions of Mr. Kofi Annan and members of the international community and to thank them for their assistance and support. Nigeria hopes that our brotherly neighbour will protect and respect the rights and freedoms of Nigerian nationals who decide to remain in the area in accordance with the mutually agreed terms.   “Nigeria believes that the reform of the United Nations system must not lose momentum. National or regional interests should not be allowed to obscure our common objectives for a reinvigorated United Nations. The reform should be linked to the overall interest of making our Organization stronger  more effective and better positioned to meet the challenges facing both the weak and the strong.   “The identity  importance and relevance of the different organs of the Organization must be maintained. Above all  nothing should be done to weaken one in favour of the other. The General Assembly  as the pre-eminent  deliberative  policymaking and representative organ of the United Nations  deserves the support of all Members. It remains the only organ where States big or small  rich or poor  find equality and voice.   “It is in this context that African countries  along with other Members of the United Nations  have called for the reform of the Security Council. For us  no reform will be complete without the reform of that vital organ. The Security Council  as now constituted  does not reflect the realities of our time. We hope that progress will be made on this issue during this session.   “I cannot conclude this statement without paying a special tribute to my brother  the distinguished statesman Mr. Kofi Annan. Nigeria salutes his dedicated service to our Organization. He has  in the past 10 years  assiduously piloted the United Nations through very important milestones and turbulent waters.   “It is  indeed  impossible to forget the reform agenda that you have initiated and set in motion. We are proud of you and your services and wish you the best in your future endeavours. As I am attending the General Assembly for the last time in my capacity as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria  I wish to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues and the Secretary-General as well as all the staff of our Organization for their support and cooperation over the past seven years.” "
"127",5160,"NIC",61,2006,"Allow me to begin by congratulating the 192nd Member State  Montenegro  upon its accession to membership of the United Nations.  On 5 November  elections will be held in Nicaragua to elect its new Government. This session is therefore occurring at an appropriate moment for taking stock  before our own people and before the peoples of the United Nations  of the Nicaragua that could be achieved if the work carried out during the five-year term of the current President Enrique Bolaños Geyer is continued.  It has been our lot to fight tirelessly for a value which was recently consolidated in its universal dimension: the defence of democracy  which includes as essential components the rule of law  the balance of powers  the strengthening of State institutions and combating corruption.   Nicaragua has not travelled this difficult road alone. A new collective spirit has been present which has assisted its efforts  making it possible to overcome and punish corruption. Thanks to this same collective solidarity it was also possible to counter the partisan division of the State and the still-latent attempts to break with the cardinal rule of separation and independence of the public authorities. I must mention here that whenever anti-democratic forces sought to break with the constitutional order  they encountered the joint response of the people of Nicaragua  the private business sector  organized civil society and the international community.  Our first words of thanks go to all those Governments and organizations that  through their support  helped to protect in Nicaragua the principles of freedom and democracy that have today emerged as the new basic values of a renewed international society.  We thank our brother countries of the region and the Secretary-General of the Central American Integration System  the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS) and his Special Envoy in Nicaragua  the Member States of OAS  the Rio Group  the Andean Community of Nations  the Ibero-American Summit  the Caribbean Community and Common Market  Japan  the United States of America and the European Union.  But the time devoted to defending democracy has not prevented us from working to achieve the goals of development  law and order  security and stability.  Between 2002 and 2005  a period of barely four years  tax revenues increased more than three-fold  which clearly demonstrates the confidence of our citizens in their Government and also reflects the transparency of our public administration. This increase is continuing at the same pace in 2006. At their annual meeting concluded the day before yesterday  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank stated that tax earnings in Nicaragua   43 06-53323  had been strong  with an increase in revenues that bore witness to the success of the fiscal policy and reforms implemented by the Government.  On the economic front  we have achieved radical change: there is an economic upturn  and we are regaining the confidence of the international community.   Through transparency and good governance  the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative was reached. A year ago  we were selected to receive the support of the Group of Eight  as well as forgiveness of the multilateral debt owed to the IMF  the World Bank and  very shortly  the Inter-American Development Bank  amounting to a reduction of approximately $800 million in our foreign debt. These two initiatives mean that over 85 per cent of our foreign debt has been forgiven. Nicaragua can now concentrate on reducing its domestic debt  which resulted from the fraudulent collapse of banks that occurred five and a half years ago.   It was President Bolaños Geyer who  in December 2001  spoke of the need for a trade agreement  what turned into the Central American Free Trade Agreement  between the countries of Central America  the Dominican Republic and the United States. This Agreement came into force in March 2006  opening up a new era of opportunity for our region. As a result of this treaty  the volume of exports from Nicaragua to the United States has increased by 20 per cent during the eight months it has been in existence.  We have achieved three consecutive years of economic growth on the basis of private investment. Since President Bolaños took office  direct foreign investment has led to the opening of a new company every month in the tax-free zones  and total exports have increased by 100 per cent in less than five years.   We have succeeded in turning tourism into a new engine of the economy on account of the revenues it generates  and for the first time it has become the greatest source of foreign currency earnings in our trade balance. Nicaragua is ranked third among the 10 must-visit destinations  according to the prestigious Lonely Planet travel guide. Similarly  Nicaragua has been classified by the World Tourism Organization as one of the best emerging markets at the world level and the best kept secret for retirees and for real estate development. We are considered to be the country that has made the greatest progress on the economic freedom front. For its part  the World Bank report  “Doing Business”  places Nicaragua in 67th place worldwide and states that it has the best business climate in Central America and one of the best in the hemisphere. We are one of the safest countries in the hemisphere. Our murder rate is less than half the world average.  I am proud to say that we are now experiencing a new political  economic and social reality. Keeping his campaign promise  President Bolaños has virtually doubled the salary of primary and secondary school teachers and has doubled in absolute terms the budget allocated to post-secondary education.  In the area of health  the infant mortality rate fell from 35 per 1 000 live births in 2001 to 31 in 2006. The mortality rate for children under the age of 5 fell from 45 in 2001 to 40 in 2006  and the maternal mortality rate fell from 96.6 per 100 000 in 2003 to 83 in 2006. Immunization coverage increased between 2004 and 2006 by over 10 per cent.  We are developing a State policy for our emigrants  with a view to guaranteeing that they have full enjoyment of their political  social and civil rights  providing them with legal advice and with the protection to which the Constitution entitles them. We are doing all we can to defend their rights in any country where they may be found. That is the least we can do to repay the sacrifice they make in sending back remittances to improve the economic situation of their families. These remittances are equivalent to almost 50 per cent of our goods exports.   The Assembly will recall that President Reagan  when addressing the Soviet Premier on the subject of the Berlin Wall  said: “Tear down that wall”. The President of the Dominican Republic  Mr. Leonel Fernández Reyna  once observed that in a globalized world where there is free movement of capital  goods and services  it is the human beings who do not enjoy freedom of movement of labour.  Thanks to the special law on migratory incentives for Nicaraguans living abroad  nationals who have lived for at least five years outside the country can come home with their household effects  their car and their work tools.   The results we have achieved in protecting our nationals abroad are substantial and have been    06-53323 44  recognized by the international community. At the beginning of this month  the United States Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs brought to the attention of the international community the efforts made by Nicaragua through its diplomatic establishment to protect  assist and repatriate Nicaraguans who are the victims of human trafficking. We have built the material  human and technological infrastructure that will gradually generate a new political culture strengthened by the values of democracy.   Nicaragua does not see its future as being separate from that of Central America. This is why we are endeavouring to form a customs union and to further the integration process in all directions and at all levels  because this is the best way for a region which deserves prosperity and development to move forward.  Very soon  we shall start talks on an association agreement between the European Union and Central America  which will include a free trade agreement. It is an initiative that embodies the vision of two regions which  from different continents  view the future with similar values and institutions and common aspirations.  The Nicaraguan proposal to limit arms at the regional level has made substantial progress in matters relating to the submission of inventories of weapons  armed forces and public security personnel and in the generation of confidence-building measures.  According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies  per capita expenditure by Nicaragua on defence is $5.2 per year. In the list of 132 countries studied  Nicaragua is third among the countries which spent least on defence.  Nicaragua was the first independent country in the history of the United Nations to benefit from the presence of electoral observers. This time  too  Nicaragua will comply with the sacred duty of holding free and transparent elections which reflect the sovereign will of the people. On 5 November  the Nicaraguan people will have to decide between the caudillismo of the past and a future devoted to development  between corruption and transparency. We are sure that the international community will help us through this process by extending to us unwavering support at this critical moment of reaffirmation of democracy by a nation which has defended its right to freedom with its life.  The fate of our individual States is closely linked with that of our international system. The current world situation is testing the response capacity of our international system as a whole.   The problems faced by mankind are increasingly complex and tragic and call for our involvement to ensure that they are promptly and effectively dealt with. The recent crisis in the Middle East  the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan  the tensions in Iran  the problems arising in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  the social and political conflicts being experienced in Haiti  the situation in Darfur and the threats of international terrorism demonstrate that neither the appeals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan nor the proposals to reform the United Nations system can be put off.   The United Nations must be reformed to provide a ready  efficient and effective response to the immense threats to world peace that also extend to the environment and health. Nicaragua maintains the position that these reforms should be comprehensive in nature since that is the only way of overcoming bureaucratic problems that stand in the way of prompt implementation of the resolutions of the General Assembly.  The reform process should cover the Secretariat  the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council  as well as the Security Council. The membership of the Security Council should better reflect current geopolitical realities  allowing for a more equitable and democratic representation of developing countries in both permanent and non-permanent categories. This expansion should serve to enhance multilateralism  strengthening the capacity to respond to world threats and challenges with a Council that has more authority  representativity and effectiveness.   In 2003  the Government of Nicaragua arranged the nomination and recognition of the Río San Juan — Nicaragua Biosphere Reserve in the Programme on Man and the Biosphere of the United Nations Education  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) — recognition which was approved on 15 September of that year  when it became part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. This reserve was added to the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve  which  at 2 million hectares  covers 14 per cent of our national territory and is the largest continuous forested area in   45 06-53323  Central America. In early 2006  President Bolaños established a preserve for 10 years  banning the export of six forest species in danger of extinction.   Nicaragua also restates from this podium its support for the cause of the Republic of China in Taiwan  which should achieve the legitimate representation of its 23 million inhabitants. It also calls for renewed and proactive efforts by the United Nations to maintain peace in East Asia.  We launch a humanitarian appeal for the freeing of the kidnapped persons in the Far and Middle East  and worldwide. The States Members of the United Nations have a duty  both individually and collectively  to protect the world population against any action that seeks to harm the life or dignity of any human being  from the time of conception to the time of death  or to undermine his or her aspiration to live in a democratic environment and to take advantage of opportunities for development. We should devote our best efforts to giving effect to this mandate. "
"128",5207,"NLD",61,2006,"Five years after the destruction of the Twin Towers and just a few days after the commemoration of that terrible tragedy  I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the people of this great city  which serves as mankind’s meeting point.  Last year  I stressed our collective responsibility to protect tolerance from intolerance. I spoke of freedom of expression and freedom of religion. Today I should like to revisit that theme. But  in addition  I will discuss the relationship between fighting terrorism and respecting human rights  the search for peace in the Middle East and reform of the United Nations. Moreover  I will renew my call for intensified dialogue. Only dialogue at all levels of society leads to more knowledge about one another — and often to more mutual understanding.  The threat of terrorism has not subsided. To fully understand the nature of the challenge we face  we have to ask ourselves what terrorists are aiming for. They aspire to undermine a society based on democracy  fundamental freedoms  human rights and the quest for progress. In their view  there is no place for the principles and tenets of our free society. Instead  they try by means of terror and violence to impose their views of the world on others.  As to the means used by terrorists  there can be no doubt that large-scale and systematic terrorist acts qualify as crimes against humanity under international law. While civilized societies uphold international legal and moral standards in defending themselves  terrorists completely reject the central principles of international law. Our campaign against this threat must be fought with great determination by all of us. Indiscriminate violence must be countered by the collective will to defend our values  in order to protect our civilization and human dignity.  In order for this campaign to be successful in the long run  we must also place great emphasis on development  fair trade and dialogue. Unlike those who have prospects for a better life through access to education and jobs  people without prospects and without a voice are more easily lured by the siren call of hatred. To deal with that issue is one of the core missions of the United Nations. We — all nations of the United Nations — have a collective responsibility to give people a future and a voice so that they can improve their lives.  Extremists cleverly seek to exploit the freedom of open societies with the aim of destroying that very freedom. This confronts us with a dilemma: do we close our societies in self-defence  thus becoming more like the evil we face  or do we remain open societies and accept a certain degree of vulnerability? Anti-terrorism measures can be effective only if adopted within the context of the human rights commitments we have undertaken. Ultimately  our defence should not come at the expense of the very values upon which our societies are founded. Our citizens must be able to distinguish between the societies in which they lead productive lives and the terrorist movements for which human life has little value. I am happy with the agreement we reached on the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). But now  we must see to its implementation. It is also in our collective interest to conclude a terrorism convention as well.  The need for interfaith and intercultural dialogue is as great as ever. During and after the so-called cartoon crisis  I engaged in discussions with colleagues and the media in Asia and the Middle East. We talked about freedom of expression and freedom of religion  and I discovered that such personal efforts are crucial in finding common ground. One of the initiatives we have taken is to host the annual Asia-Europe Meeting conference on interfaith dialogue in Amsterdam in 2008.  For any interfaith dialogue to be meaningful  respect for diversity is a precondition. In our view  all of the world’s nationalities  religions and beliefs should live side by side  united by a tradition of pluralism  democracy and the rule of law. According to international instruments to which we all subscribe  respect for diversity means  for example  freedom of religion and belief. That includes the freedom to adhere to any religion  or to no religion at all. In my country — and in many others as well — an individual is free to be a Christian  Muslim  Jew or Hindu or to adhere to any other belief. This philosophy includes the right to change one’s belief  as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly states.    06-53005 32   We believe that the separation of Church and State and the independence of the courts are the best guarantees that nobody has the power to impose his or her beliefs on others. Freedom of religion and freedom of expression are two sides of the same coin. Does this mean that people can say whatever they want? No. The right to free speech does not entitle a person to insult others. But restrictions on the freedom of expression must never go further than what is necessary within a democratic society. In individual cases where freedom of expression conflicts with legitimate restrictions  it is up to the courts  not the Government  to decide which principle should prevail.  Peace in the Middle East would reinforce a global spirit of dialogue. We have reason to be optimistic. Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) ended hostilities between Hizbollah and Israel  unfortunately only after many innocent civilians had lost their lives. I commend the Secretary-General for his tireless efforts to promote the resolution’s effective implementation.  The renewed United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is an important symbol of hope. Peacekeepers of different religious and cultural backgrounds are working together under the sky-blue banner of the United Nations  as they have been doing in the Great Lakes region in Africa and will hopefully soon be doing in Darfur  the Sudan. I am proud of the fact that several States members of the European Union  together with Turkey  China and Indonesia  provide the backbone of UNIFIL. The Netherlands is actively considering contributing to UNIFIL’s maritime component. Practical implementation will depend on the cooperation of all parties and countries in the region  and beyond  including Syria and Iran. I call upon them to act in accordance with Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).  Regional peace also requires resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Israeli-Syrian dispute. I call upon all parties involved to seize the political momentum created by Council resolution 1701 (2006) and engage in serious dialogue. The Quartet could  at the request of the Security Council  outline a comprehensive Middle East settlement.  In this world  we need the United Nations to manage change  rather than lag behind. We need to renew and reinvigorate the United Nations. Last year’s Summit was devoted to that very task. We have made substantial progress since then  but more needs to be done. My country’s vision of an effective United Nations includes less fragmentation  more concentration and more synergy. We need a United Nations that cuts red tape  rather than one that creates more bureaucracy. For example  in an interdependent world  it makes no sense to have 38 different United Nations humanitarian and development agencies. That is why we have suggested one office  one programme  one representative and one financial mechanism at the country level.  My vision of the United Nations encompasses a Peacebuilding Commission that focuses on critical peacebuilding needs and a Human Rights Council that is the single most authoritative voice on human rights. It is a United Nations led by a Secretary-General with greater authority to determine the optimal use of human and other resources than is the case at present.  As an active Member of the United Nations  the Netherlands will continue to contribute to the best of its ability to turn this vision into reality. The Netherlands does not just preach; it delivers. For more than 60 years  ever since the foundation of the United Nations  we have provided means  ideas and people. And  of course  we remain committed to its cause.  Security Council reform is a difficult part of the overall United Nations reform agenda. A pragmatic approach would be to opt for a temporary solution that could be modified after  say  10 years. The world is dynamic and the Security Council’s composition should reflect this. The geopolitical realities of today might not necessarily be the geopolitical realities of tomorrow.  We should focus on the longer-term gains we all benefit from  rather than on short-term progress at the expense of others. Let us work to make the United Nations operate in a less antagonistic way. We have successfully tried this approach in the Group of Friends for the Reform of the United Nations  in which different countries  including the Netherlands  engage in constructive debate to arrive at solutions that are acceptable to all.  The United Nations is beset by problems that require major reforms. We are united by the opportunities and challenges of our time. In promoting peace and stability  in debating human rights issues  or in combating extreme poverty  we are compelled to work together and to coordinate our actions. Let us adopt a twenty-first-century mentality to address   33 06-53005  twenty-first-century problems. Now is the time to align our agendas and shoulder our responsibilities together. A strong United Nations strengthens us all.  Finally  I would like to express my deepest appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the commitment and determination he has shown in pursuit of a better world  with a United Nations that works effectively for the security  safety and well-being of people everywhere. Even the rocks of which he spoke seemed a light burden under his stewardship. We commend him for achieving tangible results in the area of crisis management and conflict prevention and for furthering the Millennium Development Goals. Secretary-General Annan’s personal performance has brought hope and optimism to the hearts of citizens all over the world. "
"129",5252,"NOR",61,2006,"The United Nations is now more at the centre of international affairs than it has been for many years. We see the Secretary-General and his staff driving diplomacy. They are on the ground  moving forward peace efforts in the Middle East and coordinating and sustaining peace operations in Lebanon. The United Nations is drawing up mandates and getting ready for new and urgent assignments  such as the one in Darfur.  The United Nations is assisting countries coming out of conflict  such as Burundi and Sierra Leone. It is giving protection under international law to soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan. It is also launching a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.  It is to the United Nations that we all turn when other processes fail  and Norway is working hard to support its leading role  be it by sending naval units to    06-52737 48  Lebanese waters  by having soldiers in Afghanistan  or by training future peacekeepers for Darfur.  The policy platform of the Norwegian Government states that: “It is in Norway’s best interest that we have a United Nations-led world order. The Government will therefore work to strengthen the United Nations and international law.”  The United Nations can count on Norway. We believe that our combined efforts in the areas of peace  the environment and development will pass the tests of foresight as well as hindsight.  Those of us who are staunch supporters of a strong and effective United Nations must also be key players in driving the process of change and renewal. I have the honour to serve with colleagues on a panel for United Nations reform appointed by the Secretary-General. The Panel is drawing up proposals on how the United Nations can deliver more and do so better and faster in the areas of development  humanitarian assistance and the environment.  It was the 2005 Summit that called for greater coherence in and better governance of the United Nations. Over time the United Nations has added new bodies  new organs and new activities to its portfolio. Few people comprehend the overall picture; few can tell what the United Nations is doing in a particular country for development; and few can definitively answer how much money the United Nations is spending in a specific country.  In several countries the United Nations system is represented by more than 20 different organizations. A country such as Ghana is reported to be host to 14 different United Nations agencies. Many United Nations organizations deal with many of the same issues. This is simply overlapping. More than 20 different United Nations organizations deal with water and more than 10 United Nations organizations deal with the promotion of education for young girls. This leads to a fragmented  loosely governed system; it leads to duplication and reduces possibilities for monitoring results. This is not the way we would govern our own affairs — nationally or locally. It is we  the Member States  who are to blame.  We must put an end to duplication  fragmentation and rivalry between different parts of the system. Instead  we must focus on results. We must be willing to change  adapt to new situations and relinquish tasks that are no longer needed. We need to ensure that less is spent on bureaucracy  and more is spent in the field.  Let us take  for example  the coordination of humanitarian relief after the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund headed by Jan Egeland. With these resources  he is able to coordinate more effectively through the direction of the financial flows. In the absence of a crisis governance and financing cannot be separated.  All matters of reform seem extremely controversial here in the United Nations  but they must be carried out. The most irresponsible thing we could do now would be to do nothing  i.e. to allow bodies  governing boards and their representatives to duplicate work and squander scarce resources.  The report of the High-level Panel on System-wide Coherence will be presented to the Secretary-General later this year. We have had an open  transparent process. We have held meetings in all parts of the world and listened to a great many stakeholders  practitioners and country representatives. My plea to you all — to all the Member States — is to meet that report with an open mind.  Let me be clear about this: any efficiency gain must be channelled back to the developing world. Every single cent gained in improved performance or reduced overhead must go to aid that reaches the needy. Recipients and donors alike would find that attractive.  We are in the fortunate position of having set clear goals for the Organization. Six years ago we adopted the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) here in New York. We pledged to do our utmost to achieve these goals — Norway is working on all eight. This year we give 0.96 per cent of our gross national product in development assistance and we will reach the 1 per cent mark in a few years.  Now we have vigorously set out to take a lead in realizing Millennium Development Goal 4  which compels us to reduce child mortality by two thirds by 2015. Every year  children  in numbers equal to one and a half times the population of New York City  die before their fifth birthday — most of them from preventable diseases. A number of children  equal to the death toll in the recent tsunami  die every month from pneumonia alone. Vaccines  costing just $20 for   49 06-52737  each child  could have prevented most of those common diseases.  Allowing such child mortality puts shackles on the growth potential of States  prolonging the long night of underdevelopment. This can and must be changed. Yesterday I announced that the Norwegian Government has decided to increase its annual contribution to child mortality and vaccines from $75 million per year to $125 million next year. In total  Norway will contribute $1.3 billion through 2015 for vaccine-related activities to reduce child mortality.  The next step will be to develop a global strategy for reaching Millennium Development Goal 4  specifically a plan for financing and execution. Meeting that Goal  and other Millennium Development Goals  really depends on United Nations reform. An organization that sets goals and carves them in stone — as we did when we adopted the Millennium Development Goals — such an organization must adapt its structure and methods of work to these goals.  We also have to reform the United Nations to reduce child mortality  i.e. in order to save lives as we said we should. We have done great things in the past and have greater means than any other generation and any other organization. I invite you all to join this global campaign for child survival. "
"130",5298,"NPL",61,2006,"At the outset  Madam  I would like to congratulate you warmly on your election as President of the General Assembly at this session and to assure you of my delegation’s full cooperation in discharging the responsibilities entrusted to you. I am fully confident that we will be able to bring the business of this session to a successful conclusion under your leadership.  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  the outgoing President  deserves our sincere appreciation for a job well done.  I join previous speakers in heartily welcoming the Republic of Montenegro as a fellow Member of this world body. The continued expansion of the membership underlines the importance of the United Nations as an Organization of truly global character  centrality and indispensability in global affairs.  This is  indeed  a great opportunity for me to represent the voice of the democratic Government and the sovereign people of Nepal in this Assembly. I have brought with me greetings and best wishes from the Government and the people of Nepal for the success of this session.  I wish to inform the Assembly that Nepal is undergoing a fundamental transformation following the restoration of democracy through the peaceful people’s movement in April 2006. The people of Nepal has become  for the first time in history  the real source of sovereignty and State authority. The historic parliamentary proclamation of 18 May 2006  and the subsequent decisions of the parliament  have made real contributions to safeguarding and consolidating the   5 06-53329  gains of the people’s movement. We are currently engaged in institutionalizing an edifice of a democratic and inclusive Nepali State through the reinstated parliament.  The people and the Government of Nepal are thankful to the international community for its strong support during our struggle for democracy. We are hopeful of even greater support and solidarity in our transition towards full-fledged democracy and lasting peace.  This momentous change in Nepal has also led to the conversion of a protracted conflict into a peace process  and we are confident that it will be brought to a successful conclusion. I take this opportunity to sincerely express my appreciation to the Secretary-General for his assistance to the peace process  including in the monitoring of human rights  assistance in ceasefire monitoring  arms management and the observation of elections to the Constituent Assembly  at our request. The successful resolution of our internal conflict will set a worthwhile example to the rest of the world that democracy is indispensable and brightens the prospects for resolution of conflicts of all kinds.  Now  we have pressing post-conflict reintegration  rehabilitation and reconstruction needs. Meeting these challenges requires an enhanced level of international support and assistance. Peace  security  stability  democracy and development constitute global public goods. It is critically important that newly emerged democracies are safeguarded and protected  thus allowing them to develop further and flourish. With this vision in mind  we strongly support the newly established United Nations Democracy Fund.  The United Nations today is confronted with numerous challenges  such as international terrorism and transnational crime  the threat of use of weapons of mass destruction  narcotic drugs and human trafficking  money-laundering and other financial crimes  regional conflicts and low-intensity wars  extreme poverty and hunger  human rights abuses  successive natural disasters and the threats posed by pandemics such as HIV/AIDS and avian flu.  These challenges call for new wisdom founded on the principles of collective security  well-being and prosperity. The United Nations is uniquely placed to muster the much-needed philosophical underpinning because of its standing as a global body armed with legitimacy. New wisdom alone will not be enough to deal with these problems if new strategies  new tools and new resources do not match it. Nepal firmly believes that multilateral solutions are required to address problems and challenges of a global nature. Multilateralism is the key to promoting global participation in problem-solving and to ensuring collective ownership of outcomes.  Today  old and new threats to peace and security exist side by side. While military threats to security are diminishing gradually  new sources of threat have emerged and are likely to disturb international peace and security in more than one way.  The growing menace of international terrorism characterizes the security scenario in our post-cold-war world. It has been the consistent policy of Nepal to unequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It is disheartening to note that no international consensus has yet emerged paving the way for the early conclusion of a comprehensive international convention against terrorism. In this context  we welcome the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288).   We are concerned about the dismal progress on disarmament. After failing to agree on non-proliferation last year  we were unable to produce an agreement during the review of the regime to control small arms and light weapons. We are also constantly reminded of the deadlock in efforts to resolve nuclear issues by peaceful means. Nepal stands for general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction  including biological  chemical  nuclear and radiological weapons  in a time-bound manner. The demand of our time is that we compete for peace  not war  and for development  not armaments.  We have offered to host  in Kathmandu  the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament for Asia and the Pacific. Despite our long-standing commitment and sincere efforts  the Centre has yet to be relocated. I wish to reiterate that the Government of Nepal is ready to sign the host country agreement  pursuant to the Assembly resolution  as soon as the Secretariat provides it with a draft. We urge the Secretariat to conclude the necessary procedures for the relocation of the Centre to Nepal without further delay.  The recent upsurge of violence in Lebanon has left unbearable human tragedy in its wake and has    06-53329 6  resulted in the large-scale destruction of material property. We welcome the ongoing ceasefire and express our support for Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) on strengthening the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We are committed to contributing a battalion of troops for the cause of peace there.  Nepal’s profound interest and continued participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions underscores its contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security. Even when it had its own internal conflict  Nepal never stopped sending troops to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Nepalese Blue Helmets have served in various missions  including in many trouble spots  in an exemplary manner  earning international repute for them and their country. Currently  Nepal has over 3 500 troops in various United Nations missions. Many of them have sacrificed their precious lives in the service of peace and humanity. Nepal will continue to uphold this noble cause and participate in future missions when asked to do so.  Nepal’s commitment to human rights is total and unflinching. Nepal firmly believes that all human rights are universal  indivisible  interrelated  interdependent and mutually reinforcing. We welcomed the establishment of the Human Rights Council in the belief that that body will prove effective in protecting and promoting human rights around the globe based on the salient principles of universality  objectivity and non-selectivity.  The current Government of Nepal has accorded top priority to the protection and promotion of human rights with a view to translating Nepal’s international human rights commitments and obligations into reality. We have been working closely with the United Nations human rights bodies  including the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal  to create an environment in which full enjoyment of human rights by all is guaranteed. The return of democracy and the start of the peace process have led to a significant improvement in the protection of human rights in Nepal. We greatly appreciate the role played by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal in improving the human rights situation in the country.  We are determined to bring to an end the culture of impunity which was so pervasive during the autocratic regime. Our belief is that no one is above the law and that those who violate and abuse human rights must be brought to justice. We are fully committed to protecting human rights in all situations and creating a framework to bring to justice those who have violated human rights in the past.  Opportunities arising out of globalization  such as those associated with global migration  have been stifled by unfriendly policy regimes around the world. The rights of migrant workers must be protected in all situations in accordance with international norms. Nepal’s experience shows that the benefit of remittances generated by migrant workers counts a great deal for developing countries. But that cannot in any way be a substitute for development assistance  debt relief or trade concessions.  The benefits of trade liberalization are not distributed equitably. The multilateral trading regime must be made responsive to the needs and requirements of the developing and least developed countries. Enhanced trading opportunities  coupled with productive capacities  are critically important for the achievement of sustained economic growth and poverty reduction in the least developed countries (LDCs). The agreed commitments for duty-free and quota-free access for the products of the least developed countries need to be complemented with favourable rules on origin.   We are concerned about the suspension of World Trade Organization (WTO) talks on the development round  and urge the immediate revival of the talks to complete the Doha Development Agenda.  Our development agenda has been advancing rather slowly. We realize that  given the current pace  many countries will not be able to achieve the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals. It reminds us that we must urgently and sincerely implement all the commitments agreed to in the various global compacts of recent years  including the Monterrey Consensus  the Millennium Declaration  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries.  This year’s midterm review of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries showed that most of the least developed countries will not be able to achieve the agreed targets within the previously   7 06-53329  defined time frame unless we accelerate the pace of implementation.  The least developed countries need better policies on aid  trade  investment  debt relief and capacity-building  as well as timely reforms in the international financial institutions. We call on the international community to take a holistic approach  combining policies to support the LDC development agenda. The least developed countries need a substantial flow of external aid and investment if they are to meet those goals. Investment in poorer countries is not just a moral responsibility; it is investment in the collective security of the world.  Many least developed countries are handicapped as a result of being landlocked  which significantly reduces their competitive edge in regional and multilateral trading regimes. This state of affairs continues to frustrate their development efforts. We urge the international community to pay greater attention to the plight of those countries and to make serious efforts to implement internationally agreed commitments.  It is a scar on our conscience that hundreds of millions of people are living as refugees in various parts of the globe. The international community must take it as its bounden duty to address their concerns in a non-selective manner.  I regret to inform the Assembly that more than 100 000 refugees from southern Bhutan have been in camps in Nepal for over a decade and half — a painful experience — despite the bilateral agreements reached between Nepal and Bhutan. With no early and lasting solution on the horizon  the refugees are showing increasing signs of frustration and desperation. In essence  this is a problem between the Government of Bhutan and its citizens. Nepal has entered the picture simply because it has provided shelter to fleeing refuges on humanitarian grounds. The issue cannot be resolved in the absence of a genuine willingness on the part of the Government of Bhutan to solve this problem.   The international community must exert a positive influence so as to break the impasse. We stress that the Bhutanese refuges must be given the right to return to their home country in conditions of dignity and respect and that any solution must be acceptable to them. Nepal also supports the democratic aspirations of the people of Bhutan and urges Bhutan to accommodate the plight of the refugees in their political dispensation.  Our Organization has made great strides  especially in the adoption of the reform measures endorsed by world leaders here last year. The Government of Nepal remains committed to supporting all reform initiatives aimed at addressing the concerns and aspirations of all Member States.  The strength of the United Nations lies in its democratic decision-making and in its impartiality  neutrality and efficiency. The General Assembly — the only global body in which the voices of the peoples of the world can be heard — must be placed at the forefront of all decision-making processes within the United Nations. The organs dealing with socio-economic issues must be strengthened and enabled to take a lead role in the fulfilment of international development objectives.  Contemporary realities dictate that the United Nations must undergo a fundamental transformation without undermining its founding principles and objectives. Any reform of the United Nations will be incomplete without a commensurate reform of its principal organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council must be democratized so as to provide it with greater legitimacy and credibility. There is a genuine need to increase Council membership  in both the permanent and non-permanent categories  so as to make the Council more representative. Such an increase should include two permanent seats each for the Asian and African regions  one for Latin America and one for Western Europe. We also need to improve the Council’s working methods.  This year  Member States will elect the next Secretary-General of our Organization. In accordance with the principle of equitable geographical representation and that of rotation  Nepal reiterates that the next Secretary-General should come from Asia. We also believe that a greater role should be played by the Assembly in the appointment of the Secretary-General. I commend the role played by the outgoing Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  during his term of office. He led important reforms at the United Nations and made genuine efforts to establish the central role of our Organization in resolving global problems and debating international issues.    06-53329 8   Nepal has submitted its candidature for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the period 2007-2008. We think that we rightly deserve it  as nearly two decades have elapsed since we last served on the Council  in 1988-1989. This world body is fully aware that Nepal has for a long time been making substantial contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security by regularly providing troops to various peacekeeping missions. Moreover  we believe that Nepal’s election to the Council this time around would represent a significant recognition of its democratic credentials in a changed context. The people of Nepal deserve due recognition from the international community for their unprecedented courage and for the determination with which they have defeated autocracy and restored democracy. I make a sincere appeal to fellow Members to extend their valuable support to Nepal’s candidature and allow it to serve on the Council with renewed confidence in the fulfilment of its fundamental responsibilities.  The purposes and principles of the United Nations contained in its Charter  including the sovereign equality of nations  the peaceful resolution of all disputes  non-interference in the internal affairs of States  and the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force are sacrosanct to Nepal. I solemnly reiterate Nepal’s profound commitment to the founding objectives and principles of the United Nations  as enshrined in its Charter.  The United Nations today suffers from a lack of credibility  an inability to arrive at important decisions  weak implementation of its own declarations and decisions  and slowness in responding to challenges that require its most pressing attention. We need to change this situation. Together  we can better equip our Organization to respond to those challenges. "
"131",5315,"NRU",61,2006,"The Republic of Nauru congratulates the President of the General Assembly on her election. Nauru commends her pledge to work with Member States to achieve the objectives of the United Nations Charter with transparency and with respect for all views and positions. She has our support and cooperation as she leads this Assembly in the days ahead.  Nauru congratulates the outgoing President  Jan Eliasson  on his appointment as Foreign Minister of Sweden and commends him for implementing the World Summit Outcome Document. His significant contribution has been crucial to the United Nations reform process.  We pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and thank him for his leadership  courage and vision over the past 10 years.  While we aim to reform this great Organization  in line with the realities of the world  we continue to witness major upheavals  conflicts  explosions of violence  natural disasters  terrorism and the giants we have yet to conquer — that is  poverty  disease and human and environmental degradation. We must assure the people of the world that we are committed to finding lasting solutions to global problems  while upholding the principles of the United Nations with full respect for human rights.  But Nauru is concerned that much has been said  but very little has been done. We must  therefore  focus on doing more  as opposed to talking more. And  of equal importance  we must be seen to be doing more  not seen to be talking more.  As a small island developing State  Nauru’s concerns relate primarily to development. Yet we have seen little  if any  action to implement the outcome of the Mauritius summit meeting on the sustainable development of small island developing States held last year. There have been no substantial reductions in global emissions since the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. The Monterrey Consensus  whereby the wealthier countries would increase official development assistance to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product  is still far from being translated into reality.  Despite private and public pledges by the United Nations  we in the Pacific have yet to see the establishment of United Nations offices in the smaller    06-53317 6  Pacific member countries of the United Nations  such as Nauru.   Despite this Organization’s pledge for universality and the protection of human rights for all  we still deny the 23 million people of Taiwan their right to peace and to development without threat of attack  including through the denial of their right to representation at the United Nations.  Mr. Romulo (Philippines)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  We support the inclusivity of the United Nations  and we reject threats to human dignity  including the denial that the Holocaust ever occurred  together with any call for the elimination of any responsible Member State of this Organization.  That is why Nauru will join other Member countries in protesting and seeking legal redress to the violations of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly that occurred during the meeting of the General Committee last week. Two questions were to be debated: a proactive role for the United Nations in maintaining peace and security in East Asia  and the question of the representation and participation of the 23 million people of Taiwan in the United Nations.  The employment of procedural tricks to deny member countries their right to take part in the debate calls into question the universality of the United Nations  for such tricks only serve to deprive Nauru and like-minded countries of their right to be heard. Even more important  it underlines the need for reform of the United Nations.  There must be a greater voice of the many peoples of the globe  including those of the developing world and those countries that can better represent the interests of the developing world. Nauru  therefore  echoes the words of the Secretary-General when he says:   “I believe very strongly in the need for Security Council reform  and I have said time and time again that no reform of the UN will be complete without Security Council reform. ... They should pursue Security Council reform because it is part of the reason why we have tensions in the Organization today. Because quite a lot of Members feel that our governance structure is anachronistic and we cannot continue to have a situation where the power base is perceived to be controlled by a limited number of five Member States.”  We believe we must move quickly to reform the Council and also to include Japan  Brazil  India and Germany in the permanent membership.  We encourage the United Nations  as part of the reform package  to consider a more binding framework by which the many declarations arising from the Organization and its many meetings can be implemented and measured. Clearly  our moral obligations are not producing the desired results. It is time to build a global partnership within a binding framework in order to facilitate the implementation of resolutions.  We believe that each developing country has primary responsibility for its own development. The year 2005 marked a significant chapter in the development of my country when we presented our first national development strategy at our first donor roundtable meeting. Our national development strategy calls for a partnership. It was drafted by community leaders  civil society  the private sector and the Government of Nauru  based on a national vision. It outlines our priorities and the steps required to reach those goals within a 20-year framework. We gratefully acknowledge our development partners. They have given us tangible assistance that has improved our lives.   However  we still receive offers of development assistance that come with unrealistic conditions attached. In some cases  such assistance is used as a tool of interventionist foreign policy  without giving priority to the human aspect of the development agenda.  For any fragile developing State  delayed assistance creates a perception of failure and incompetence and leads to political and social instability. My delegation is disappointed that the intention of the United Nations to expand its presence in Nauru and other Pacific countries continues unfulfilled. The purpose of an expanded presence would be to achieve the MDGs and other development objectives. We call on the United Nations to recognize our urgent needs and to act with certainty  following a realistic timetable.  My delegation believes that good governance yields good returns for all people. Nauru is emerging   7 06-53317  from governance problems caused by shortcomings in the Constitution adopted at our independence. We are grateful for the assistance from the United Nations Democracy Fund that will facilitate the consultative process for a review of our Constitution. That process is critical to the political stability and accountability of future Governments.  In the Summit Outcome  we agreed on measures aimed at protecting our common environment  including a call for a more coherent institutional framework to address the environmental challenges of today. We encourage revisiting the climate change agenda to give more urgency to action as opposed to pledges.  In this regard  we also welcome the Secretary-General’s establishment of a High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence. Nauru aligns itself with the interventions made by the leaders of Pacific nations who have taken the floor before me regarding the concerns and challenges facing the Pacific Island States. As island States  we are vulnerable to the forces of nature because of our remoteness and small populations. As island States  we are affected by factors such as shortage of manpower and technical capacity  weak institutional capacity  limited financial resources and too little foreign direct investment. We lack information and access to environmentally friendly and affordable technologies  including new and sustainable energy sources. Our challenges are intensified by a lack of commitment from the United Nations to support our development aspirations. We hope that the High-level Panel’s report will recognize these special challenges and propose realistic solutions.  Sustainable development and basic human rights cannot thrive in a world without peace and security. We must continue to strengthen our collective efforts in resolving conflicts and threats of terrorism through prevention and effective political solutions.  The proliferation of small arms continues to pose a threat to peace and security in our region. My delegation shares the view of the Secretary-General in his report that  “These weapons may be small  but they cause massive destruction” (A/61/1  para. 102). Nauru is deeply concerned that the 2006 Small Arms Review Conference ended without agreement on further measures to combat this problem. If it is true that whoever is faithful in the small things will also be faithful in the bigger things  then how can we progress towards the elimination of weapons adaptable to mass destruction while failing to agree on the issue of small arms and light weapons?  Finally  “Can two walk together  except they be agreed?” Let us reflect on this passage from the Book of Amos as we renew our partnership of commitment to spare no effort. "
"132",5362,"NZL",61,2006,"New Zealand remains unwavering in its support for the United Nations. Our commitment has not changed since we helped found the Organization 61 years ago. This year’s events have only reinforced our belief that the world would be substantially worse off without the United Nations.  It would be remiss of me at this time not to pay tribute to Kofi Annan. It is to his vision  determination and courage that we must attribute many of the reforms achieved thus far. Five years ago  when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize  the Nobel Committee paid tribute to his efforts on reform. Since then he has continued to work tirelessly for a United Nations that can live up to the hopes that “we the peoples” have invested in it. This is all the more remarkable given that  for much of his stewardship  the United Nations has been confronted with some of the most difficult international crises of its existence.   New Zealand is committed to multilateralism. This is not some act of faith  but a commitment to a multilateralism that really delivers. We need to be prepared to work diligently for the good of the global community.  The United Nations is passing through a period of challenge to its relevance and effectiveness. It has   19 06-53323  confronted serious political and security shocks — fresh hostilities in the Middle East  the tragic and worsening situation in Darfur  and  in our own region  instability in Timor-Leste.  Last year  world leaders agreed to an ambitious reform agenda based on the three pillars of peace and security  development and human rights. Progress has been made  but this is no time to rest. We must press on  for much remains to be done.  The challenge of development has never been higher on the international agenda. Never before has the commitment to eradicating poverty been so critical. But increasing aid levels will not be enough; we must become more effective. We need to make sure that every dollar we spend makes a positive difference. That means addressing the key threats to our success — poor governance  corruption and gender inequality. We need to secure fairer international trading relationships  and we must work on all of those together.  The theme of this year’s general debate is the implementation of a global partnership for development. For New Zealand  collective action is imperative. We need participation  ownership and responsibility from recipient countries. We seek harmonization with larger contributors to align and combine our contributions. We seek partnership with multilateral development agencies in our campaign to eradicate poverty  and we endorse the efforts of the United Nations and those agencies to coordinate better  country by country.  New Zealand  as members are aware  has a relationship with the Pacific that is based on history  culture and economic and social linkages. Our bonds with Pacific States are an important dimension of our other relationships. We want nothing less than educated  healthy  well-governed  economically prosperous and safe communities.  In the Auckland Declaration of 2004  Pacific leaders committed themselves to a “region that is respected for the quality of its governance  the sustainable management of its resources  the full observance of democratic values and for its defence and promotion of human rights”. These are ambitious goals  and translating them into reality means hard work by all Pacific countries. That is a challenge that New Zealand accepts.  In facing that challenge  we confront economic  environmental  governance  development and security issues. Markets are distant. Climate change is a reality. Political instability does not help. Threats from communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and pandemic influenza must be managed.  The Pacific accounts for almost one quarter of the surface of the world — an area bigger than Europe and the Middle East combined. Its strategic significance presents opportunity and challenge. New Zealand is determined to seek out the benefits of that significance and guard against the threats  among which I include  sadly  cheque-book diplomacy.  Across the Pacific  we have learned that regional problems require regional solutions. Last year  Pacific Island Forum leaders adopted the Pacific Plan for regional cooperation. Through that plan we will strengthen regional cooperation where it can most make a difference  and we will use it to promote the four goals of the Pacific Islands Forum: sustainable development  economic growth  security and good governance.  At the same time  we do not forget that our regional endeavours depend on strong international frameworks. The Framework Convention on Climate Change is an essential example. Another example is the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement on the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.  We are proud of our achievements in regional fisheries management. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission  with its headquarters in Pohnpei  manages the region’s migratory fish species. We are in the midst of developing new regional arrangements for non-migratory fish stocks.  These mechanisms are central to the region’s ability to ensure the sustainable management of its most important natural resources. They are at the leading edge in establishing best-practice management norms.  There have been profound political and security shocks over the past year — in the Middle East and in Darfur  as well as instability in Timor-Leste — those and more are testing the United Nations system.  It is a sad reality that the situation in the Middle East has been on the agenda of the United Nations for 60 years  ever since its inception. The lack of sustained    06-53323 20  political will to see through more than a handful of decisions on the Middle East has undermined confidence. It has contributed to an unstable environment where extremism  injustice and despair flourish.  These issues must be tackled with a new resolve  using the international multilateral system as a tool for peace and progress. The international response to the Security Council’s call for an expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) shows that the international community can react to conflict and provide basic stabilization. But such responses are doomed to failure unless the underlying political and security issues are addressed. It is therefore imperative to relaunch the Middle East peace process covering all issues  on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.  The Organization’s efforts to introduce a United Nations force into Darfur is being cynically thwarted by the Government of the Sudan. That is simply unconscionable. The Government of the Sudan must  in the name of basic humanity  accept the need for a United Nations force as the best chance for the security of the people of Darfur.  New and fragile States face enormous challenges. Recent unrest in Timor-Leste demonstrates that fact. New Zealand responded quickly to Timor-Leste’s needs with a military and police contribution to help restore stability. The regional response has been swift and robust. The United Nations played an important role in facilitating Timor-Leste’s independence  and it is clear the United Nations will continue to be involved in Timor-Leste for many years to come. The deployment of a substantial United Nations police force is vital if peace and stability is to be maintained even in the medium term. The nature of the expanded United Nations mission in Timor-Leste reflects the deep and broad engagement required to build a lasting peace. Timor-Leste encapsulates the principle that peace and security cannot be separated from economic development  social reconciliation and the protection of basic human rights. The Security Council’s mandate for Timor-Leste endorses that truth.  New Zealand fully supported the renewed focus on human rights at last year’s World Summit. We strongly campaigned for the new Human Rights Council  and we worked hard to bring it into being. We have high ambitions for it and will follow its activities closely. It must remain strong  focused and effective. It must be able to deal swiftly with emerging situations of human rights concern  in a balanced way  with scrupulous attention to verifiable facts. It must be aspirational  inspirational and practical. Its working methods must be transparent and inclusive. Above all  there must be genuine political will to make it work.  A few weeks ago  encouraged all the way by energetic non-governmental organizations  Member States agreed on the first new comprehensive human rights instrument of the twenty-first century: a draft convention relating to persons with disabilities. We are proud in New Zealand of the role we played in those negotiations on the text. The draft convention stands to make a real difference to the lives of approximately 650 million of the world’s most disadvantaged citizens.  New Zealand is also conscious of the disadvantages faced by indigenous peoples in many parts of the world. We were closely engaged in the lengthy negotiations towards a declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples. We had hoped that the declaration would be a new standard of achievement for Governments that could be implemented to really improve the lives of indigenous peoples. Therefore  we are disappointed that that was not to be so. The draft declaration that emerged with less than conclusive support from the Human Rights Council is deeply flawed and represents a lost opportunity for the world’s indigenous peoples.  At the beginning of his term  the Secretary-General set an important goal for the United Nations: to perfect “the triangle of development  freedom and peace” (A/51/PV.88  p. 13). The Secretary-General’s words still ring true today. We have travelled only part of the journey towards that goal. Considering our achievements over the past year  we can be satisfied with progress made in setting up the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. The challenge now is to make those two new bodies truly effective. The welcome adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) reminds us of the efforts we must continue to make at regional and national levels.  New Zealand wants to see continuing reform high on the list of priorities for the sixty-first session in order to ensure that the United Nations can be as responsive as possible to the needs of Member States    21 06-53323  and efficient in getting the best from the resources available to it.  Sixty years ago  New Zealand had high hopes for the United Nations. In 2006  we still do. New Zealand is a country that engages with the United Nations with no hidden agenda. What we say is what we mean. We engage with no other or hidden agenda. But those that do so pervert and weaken this Organization.   In 2006  at this meeting  New Zealand declares that we will continue to put our efforts behind the principles and policies that will make the United Nations strong. "
"133",5406,"OMN",61,2006,"It gives me great pleasure  Madam  to extend my warmest congratulations to you and your country  the Kingdom of Bahrain  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am fully confident that your vast experience will guide the work of the Assembly to a successful conclusion. Allow me to pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the manner in which he conducted the work of the previous session.  I would also like to commend Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  for his efforts to equip this   27 06-53317  Organization with the appropriate tools to properly respond to world events and challenges.  This session is convening in difficult times and amid important changes. Despite the successes achieved by the United Nations in establishing the Human Rights Council  the Peacebuilding Commission and the Central Emergency Response Fund  numerous dangers and challenges still lie ahead. The situation in the occupied Palestinian territories remains very tense as a result of Israel’s actions  including killing  terrorizing  collective punishment  the demolition of homes and other practices that run counter to the noble objectives of the peace process. There are requirements and obligations that must be fulfilled in order to reach a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.  Hence  we express our support for the call by the League of Arab States to refer the entire Arab-Israeli conflict to the Security Council  in order to find a lasting  comprehensive and peaceful settlement. That call reaffirms the commitment of the Arab States to peace — as a strategic option and a basis for peaceful coexistence between the Arab countries and the State of Israel as envisioned in the Arab peace initiative.  The world has recently witnessed the tragedy of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon  with the resulting destruction and huge loss of life and property. We affirm our support to the brotherly Lebanese people in that brutal crisis. We welcome the adoption by the Security Council of its resolution 1701 (2006) and hope that it will enhance security and stability in the region. The positive response to the Secretary-General’s call for greater participation in the enhanced United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is a clear indication of the support the international community accords to Lebanon.  My country is deeply concerned by the deteriorating security situation and the internal violence in Iraq. We call upon all parties in Iraq to give precedence to their national interests and to support their National Government in accordance with a conciliatory political programme that would look after the interests of all segments of the Iraqi people.  We welcome the conclusion of the Abuja Peace Agreement between the Sudanese Government and the rebel groups  and we hope that it will stop further bloodshed among the brotherly Sudanese people. We look forward to seeing a positive and effective role by the Security Council in the Sudan  in cooperation with the Sudanese Government.  Although the African continent enjoys immense natural and human resources and potential  it is plagued by conflict  the spread of disease and poverty. While we support the efforts of the African Governments to deal with those difficulties  we also call upon the international community to do all it can to help the African countries to reinforce their efforts.  Environment is the common heritage of all mankind. Conserving the environment is therefore a duty shared by all countries  and we hope that during this session further light will be shed on environmental issues. Aware of the importance of striking a balance between achieving development  on the one hand  and protecting the environment  on the other  my country has launched a national strategy aimed at protecting the environment that incorporates environmental considerations at all stages of planning.   We are making concerted efforts to protect our environment  our territorial waters and our economic areas from pollution. We are also cooperating with a number of national  regional and international organizations and agencies in protecting our natural resources and preventing their deterioration.  All are agreed that globalization has positive aspects. However  it has been noted that in some cases globalization has hurt the interests of developing countries. For that reason  my country supports the call for the establishment of a world trade order that is non-discriminatory and multidisciplinary. Such a framework would seek to achieve a balanced outcome in the decisions of the Doha Round of negotiations. It is our hope that current negotiations on multilateral trade issues  especially those related to agriculture and the service sector  will achieve success in a way that serves the interests and rights of all States equally.  We look forward to seeing the international financial  economic and trade institutions play a positive role in bridging the growth gap between developed and developing countries. We urge those institutions to provide support to developing countries to help them to attract investment funds and to gain access to global markets for their exports  without any restrictions or protectionist measures. In this regard  we welcome the offer of the brotherly State of Qatar to host the International Conference on Financing for Development in 2007.    06-53317 28   My country supports the call for a review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) with a view to closing loopholes in the Treaty and guaranteeing the right of all States parties to obtain nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. While we favour a Middle East region free from all weapons of mass destruction  we also call on all parties to the current talks on the Iranian nuclear issue to keep the door open to negotiation  since direct dialogue remains the best way of reaching a suitable compromise on pending contested issues.  An effective international counter-terrorism strategy requires a balance to be struck between security considerations and respect for human rights conventions. It is really not wise to endanger the security and stability of States on the ground of combating terrorism  nor is it fair to subject innocent people to injustice or mistreatment on the basis of mere suspicion.  Bearing in mind that human beings are the centre and focus of development  my country has designed policies aimed at the self-fulfilment of Omani citizens and the development of their potential. Social welfare programmes for individuals with special needs are a key element in the rehabilitation of those groups  so that they can participate in society alongside other citizens. In cooperation with the International Labour Organization  my country has also adopted a rehabilitation strategy focusing on local communities.  Emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the development process  my country has devoted special attention to the role of women by encouraging them to participate in development. We have introduced a draft national strategy for the advancement of women  which is the result of cooperation between governmental bodies and civil society organizations.   The Sultanate of Oman takes pride in its achievements in the area of childcare. Because of the importance of childhood in securing out investment in human resources  children are given priority in our comprehensive development programme. Our national committee for child protection and welfare was established by Royal Decree No. 71 of 1997.  Today  more than ever before  we need an effective United Nations that is able to shoulder its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. That can be achieved only through concerted efforts and political will on the part of Member States  which will enable the Organization to carry out its mission and responsibilities in the best possible manner.

"134",5453,"PAK",61,2006,"I am indeed very happy to see a sister from fraternal Bahrain presiding over the General Assembly at this important session. Your election  Madam  symbolizes the increasingly significant role that women are playing in the Muslim world. You will have Pakistan’s full support in carrying out your challenging responsibilities.    06-52731 18   This is the first time that I have addressed this body since the devastating earthquake that occurred in the northern regions of Pakistan last October. I therefore take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude for the relief and financial assistance that we received from around the world. We were deeply moved by the global solidarity displayed in the hour of our distress and need.  Multilateral cooperation is the key to addressing the existing and emerging challenges of the twenty-first century: political disputes  terrorism  proliferation  poverty  hunger  disease  economic disparities  migration  unemployment  environmental degradation and natural disasters. We appreciate the Secretary-General’s initiatives to equip the United Nations to respond to those challenges. But we are yet a distance from the vision endorsed at the 2005 United Nations Summit.  Over the past six years  despite daunting external and internal challenges  Pakistan has been transformed into a dynamic nation  moving rapidly towards the vision of our founder  namely  a modern  progressive  Islamic and democratic republic. We have reformed our institutions of governance and our economy. Democratic governance has been introduced at the grass-roots level. We are focusing on lifting up the underprivileged sectors of our society: poor people  women and minorities. Women are being politically and economically empowered and protected against discrimination. Minorities have been politically mainstreamed. We have also unshackled the media.  Having successfully put our economy on an upsurge  we are now embarked on second-generation reforms to spread the benefits of growth to all our people. One of our strategic aims is to utilize Pakistan’s unique geostrategic position to build trade  energy and communication corridors linking South Asia  West Asia  Central Asia and China. Regional integration will accelerate economic growth and prosperity in our part of Asia and even beyond. Of course  Pakistan still faces daunting challenges from within and without. We are facing them boldly to build an environment of peace and stability in our region.  Pakistan desires a peaceful environment in the region. We have been engaged in a peace process with India aimed at building confidence and resolving issues — including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute — that have been the source of tension and conflict between the two countries in the past. The improved relations and the conducive international environment have brought an acceptable solution to this long-standing dispute within reach. I am confident that my positive meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Havana will help to carry the peace process forward  which is vital for the future of both countries and for peace in South Asia and beyond.  A stable security environment is also important for peace in our region. Pakistan has proposed the creation of a strategic restraint regime in South Asia  encompassing minimum nuclear deterrence and a balance of conventional forces. We do not want to enter into an arms race. But we will do whatever is necessary to preserve the credibility of our minimum defensive deterrence level.  Pakistan has a legitimate requirement for nuclear power generation to meet the energy needs of our expanding economy and our expanding industry. As a responsible nuclear State  we will continue to seek nuclear technology for power generation under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. We cannot accept discrimination in the nuclear field.  Peace and stability in Afghanistan is in Pakistan’s vital interest. It will assure tranquillity on our western frontiers. It will also enable Pakistan to realize its ambition of linking Central Asia and South Asia through Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Afghanistan confronts complex security  political and economic challenges  including a resurgent Taliban that also threatens Pakistan’s efforts to combat extremism and terrorism. The common challenge imposes a joint responsibility on Pakistan  Afghanistan and the coalition forces.  Problems in the border regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan are compounded by the continuing presence in Pakistan of over 3 million Afghan refugees  some of them sympathetic to the Taliban. The incentives offered by the international community to the refugees for their voluntary return are minimal. A serious international commitment is required to facilitate their repatriation to their country.  The unfortunate history of our region has placed Pakistan in the frontline of the global campaign against terrorism. We cooperate daily with many countries  including the United States and the United Kingdom. Our cooperation has pre-empted several terrorist plots    19 06-52731  such as the one uncovered recently to blow up airliners flying from London. Over the past five years  Al-Qaida has been significantly degraded as an organization in our region.  While we confront terrorism our strategy must seek to eliminate this phenomenon comprehensively. We cannot do so unless we understand and address the root causes of terrorism today. How are terrorists able to find willing recruits  even among educated young people  in advanced and democratic societies? The reasons are clear. Across the Muslim world  old conflicts and new campaigns of military intervention have spawned a deep sense of desperation and injustice. Each new battleground involving an Islamic State has served as a new breeding ground for extremists and terrorists. Indiscriminate bombings  civilian casualties  torture  human rights abuses  racial slurs and discrimination only add to the challenge of defeating terrorism.  In my view  a two-pronged strategy  which I call enlightened moderation  is required to address the situation. That strategy envisages that  apart from combating terrorism frontally  the international community must undertake resolute efforts to resolve the conflicts afflicting the Islamic world. Unless we end the foreign occupation of Muslim countries and suppression of Muslim peoples  terrorism and extremism will continue to find recruits among alienated Muslims in various parts of the world.  We also need to bridge  through dialogue and understanding  the growing divide between the Islamic and Western worlds. In particular  it is imperative to end racial and religious discrimination against Muslims and to prohibit the defamation of Islam. It is most disappointing to see personalities of high standing oblivious to Muslim sensitivities at these critical moments.  The greatest challenge to global security  to the campaign against terrorism  to the promotion of harmony among civilizations and to the credibility of the United Nations is the cauldron of conflict that is the Middle East — exemplified by the latest Israeli aggression against Lebanon. We hope that the resolution painstakingly brokered in the Security Council will lead to a rapid and complete Israeli withdrawal and the restoration of Lebanon’s sovereignty over its entire territory.  The attack on Lebanon has far-reaching implications for the Middle East. The ability and relevance of moderate forces to bring about a just peace in the region has been put to a very severe test. The world must  however  still support them to address the festering problems of the region comprehensively and fairly. It is time to end Israel’s conflicts with all its neighbours. It is time  first and foremost  to end the tragedy of Palestine. There is no doubt in our mind — there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind — that that lies at the core not only of tackling the problems of Iraq and Afghanistan  but also of dealing with the menaces of terrorism and extremism at their roots.  The confrontation over Iran’s nuclear programme threatens further instability in this already inflamed region. We are encouraged by the “Iran and 5 + 1” negotiations and believe that this issue can be resolved peacefully in a manner that accommodates the legitimate rights and interests of all parties involved. Resort to coercion and worse  the use of force  could lead to grave consequences in the region and globally.  The dynamic economic performance of several developing countries  especially in Asia  has transformed the world’s geo-economic map. Yet  most developing countries find that international trade and financial structures are weighted against them. With the Doha Round in the doldrums  new modalities must be found so as to utilize the full potential of trade for development. Similarly  the international financial system should ensure a more equitable share of international liquidity and investment for developing countries.  Unless the activities of the United Nations accommodate the concerns and priorities of its general membership  the Organization risks losing its global moral authority. The General Assembly should reassert its Charter responsibilities  and the Security Council should be reformed to make the activities of the Council more democratic  transparent  inclusive and accountable to the general membership. The reform of the Security Council is of vital interest to every Member State and must therefore be adopted by consensus or by the widest possible agreement.  This important session of the Assembly will elect the next Secretary-General of the United Nations. Pakistan hopes that consensus will soon develop in the Security Council and the Assembly on a qualified candidate from Asia. Pakistan will extend its full    06-52731 20  support to the new Secretary-General  as we have done to Mr. Kofi Annan  to build a United Nations that can decisively advance the world towards the noble vision of preventing the scourge of war and promoting better standards of living for all peoples of the world in freedom. "
"135",5496,"PAN",61,2006,"I should like to say how pleased the Government of Panama is at your election  Madam  to preside over the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. Your illustrious professional record and your extraordinary action in defence of women’s rights lead us to believe that you will guide us in an exemplary manner. I also congratulate the Secretary-General on his encouraging words yesterday. The ovation that ensued bears witness to the Assembly’s gratitude for his efforts over 10 years of heading the Secretariat.  Over the past few years we have dedicated considerable effort and time to the task of reforming the United Nations. We are doing this for one simple reason: we want it to work better. That aspiration is based on a profound conviction that the Organization is indispensable for humanity. Those who criticize the Organization must be honest when they wonder what the world would be like without the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Those who govern are examined on a daily basis by their peoples and sometimes they are criticized very severely  but nobody suggests that there should not be a government. We want governments to be better because they are necessary  just as we want the United Nations to be better because it is equally necessary. We do not want to imagine a world without a United Nations. That is why at the Summit in September last year  as the culmination of long debate and tremendous collective effort  we agreed on a series of reforms for the United Nations machinery.  What is at stake today is not just the fate of a single initiative  but  rather  the effectiveness of the United Nations in complying with the purposes and principles of the Charter. The General Assembly has acted with diligence  and we are proud in particular of the decision to create a Human Rights Council  whose establishment should strengthen respect for human rights and spread their promotion globally. Panama  born closely linked to international affairs  continues to be committed to strengthening human rights throughout the world. It is in this field that we see the greatest paradox: where the United Nations has made the most progress is where there remains the most progress still to be made. Before its inception human rights violations were almost ignored. Today the denunciations made at the United Nations have a tremendous deterrent power  so those violations do not continue to be perpetrated. At the same time  it is true that there have been horrendous violations during the life of the United Nations  but no one can deny that the reality and consequences are very different from the situation that prevailed only a few decades ago.  The United Nations and its specialized agencies have the important task of coordinating efforts to protect the millions of human beings living in poverty. Poverty is the daily denial of man’s fundamental rights. While genocide causes indignation and is emphatically rejected by the international community  there should be the same indignation over poverty  as it afflicts a    06-52879 4  large part of the world’s population. Governments have a moral obligation to help people and communities living below the poverty line. Economic growth rates are deceptive  and almost offensive  if there is no direct relief for those who have less and who  without assistance  have no chance of breaking out of the vicious circle of poverty.  Within the reforms to the Organization now being debated  we should  in order more effectively to address poverty in the world  give greater weight and authority to the General Assembly to adopt measures of universal scope  not resolutions  repeated year after year  with no binding power.  Similarly  I should like to address the need to expand the Security Council so that it truly represents today’s world and not the world as it was 60 years ago. Not to reform the Security Council would be detrimental to its purposes. A Council that is not representative cannot be as legitimate or effective. However  although there is consensus about the need to reform  how to reform has provoked more disunity than agreement. From Panama’s perspective  geographical representation is an important factor to be considered  but it cannot be the only one. A member of the Security Council does not sit on the Council to represent itself or the geographic region to which it belongs; it represents all Member States  which have entrusted it with this responsibility because it has shown the commitment and capacity to further the effort to maintain international peace and security.  It is time now to look at this topic with different eyes. The facts that are developing continuously in the Middle East  and the fact that terrorist attacks continue to occur throughout the world  show that it is crucial to strengthen the Security Council as soon as possible through a process of reform that includes a moderate expansion of the membership while the Council remains legitimate in the eyes of the rest of the international community. Strengthening the organs of the United Nations  and more particularly the Security Council  will make it possible for events such as those in Lebanon to be met with a prompt and effective response. If the Organization had had the required instruments to act robustly with legitimacy  we could have put an early end to the confrontations; in fact  they could have been avoided entirely if we had had an adequate preventive force. The rapid escalation of the conflict has highlighted the imperative need to resolve the Middle East crisis so that Jews  Muslims and Christians can coexist in peace  as they do in Panama and many other parts of the world.  There are tested ways to promote confidence among parties  to reconcile positions and to achieve consensus. The use of arms can help some people to gain some short-term objectives but the atmosphere is poisoned and there cannot be peaceful coexistence among neighbours  families and peoples that geography has placed so close to one another. It is obvious from every perspective that a solution to the conflict requires the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israel from the occupied territories  establishment of the Palestine State and recognition of Israel’s right to exist as a State. All the countries in the region must have sufficient guarantees that conflicts will not be resolved through force and that no territory can be used to attack a neighbour. Peace in the Middle East has to be built by each and every State with the resolute support of the international community.  Our vision is the same for other regions of the world where a high degree of political tension still prevails and endangers the peace. Peaceful solutions cannot be postponed  for there is always the risk of violent confrontations of unsuspected dimensions that we will all deplore.  I should like to draw attention to a significant event that will take place in my country in the next few weeks and will have an impact on world trade. On 22 October there will be a referendum to decide whether the Panama Canal should be expanded. The historic and emotional dimension of the canal for the Panamanian people means that its expansion is the only decision of the legislature and the Executive that needs a referendum for confirmation. The Panama Canal links the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is therefore the best route for the transport of goods between different continents  between two countries in the American continent  and even between two coasts in a single country. Five per cent of world maritime trade passes through the Panama Canal. The percentage varies from one country to another: 3.5 per cent of an economy the size of China’s; 16 per cent of the United States foreign trade; and 35 per cent of Chile’s trade. The fact is that the future of the Panama Canal affects the international community as a whole.  Only seven years ago the canal was run by the United States. After a long and complex negotiation that included a special meeting of the Security Council   5 06-52879  in Panama — one of only two times that that body has met outside New York Headquarters — it reverted to Panama on the last day of the twentieth century. Since then Panama has administered the canal with efficiency and safety  and it is now about to decide whether to take the tremendous step of expanding the canal to enhance its capacity and allow larger ships to use it.  The United Nations has always been involved in Panama’s fate  the fate of the canal. It was on the agenda when it was a continuing source of conflict between Panama and the United States. It supported the Universal Congress on the canal in 1997 and finally it welcomed the canal’s orderly transfer to Panamanian jurisdiction. That is why Panama once again wishes to draw the General Assembly’s attention to the canal and to reiterate its gratitude to the Non-Aligned Movement  because last week the Heads of State and Government adopted a declaration recognizing the efficient administration of the Panama Canal and expressing their support for the initiative to expand its present capacity. The canal is the most important resource for my country’s development and is a valuable strategic avenue at the service of trade and communications for the entire world.  In my country there is full awareness that our geographic position is our major asset  but that its exploitation involves responsibilities towards the international community. That is why  while we welcome international recognition of the manner in which we have been administering the canal  we also wish to tell the world body that the Panama Canal will continue to be managed so as to be efficient  neutral and safe  for the benefit of all ships in the world  flying every flag.

"136",5543,"PER",61,2006,"First  allow me to express to you  Madam President  our congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at this session. I should also like to convey to you the best wishes of the people and Government of Peru for a successful stewardship. We are ready to work with you for the benefit of the international community.  When the Government of President Alan García took office on 28 July it found a particularly serious social deficit in the country. More than 13 million Peruvians  half our population  live in poverty; 5 million of them  or 20 per cent of our population  live in extreme poverty. Peru is therefore experiencing a   21 06-53609  situation of deep inequity for a medium-income country.   In order to tackle this reality  the new Government has placed major emphasis on responsible State action  designing an agenda of social inclusion based on promoting investment for job creation. That agenda requires that we learn to act with greater solidarity  on the basis of civic values  with due attention given to the most vulnerable groups  so that they may fully participate in drawing up public policies. Initial action is aimed at restoring confidence in our society as a factor crucial for promoting long-term development and shared growth. In this respect  my Government is working with the social sectors to develop a culture of duty as one of the main pillars supporting Government policies and the relationship between society and the State.  The Government of Peru has made the fight against poverty a central priority of its Administration. It has also set the guidelines for its external action  in which it aims to join the other nations of the Latin American region in drawing up a development agenda to achieve growth with equity and social inclusion. In this context  we reaffirm our conviction of the need to promote Latin American integration. For this purpose we are working on strengthening the Andean Community and building the South American Community of Nations.  That is the goal that inspires us  because in order to express the common interests of our continent in a world such as today’s we must act together to better tackle the challenges of globalization. A Latin America with a united voice will be better placed to tackle its common problems  such as the marginalization of wide sectors of the population  internal imbalances and social divisions. A more united Latin America can also better project the values of democracy and pluralism that characterize it today. In this framework  tolerance and respect for differences will make it possible to strengthen projects of common interest offering all our citizens true opportunities for development and well-being.  One of the challenges that our continent  and in particular the Andean region  must face decisively is the fight against drug trafficking. Peru reaffirms its firm position of combating forcefully and comprehensively the illicit trafficking of drugs  emphasizing the principles of multilateralism and shared responsibility. To that end  we have been carrying out a careful evaluation of the current state of cooperation in the fight against illegal drug trafficking. Following the principle of shared responsibility  Peru has expressed an interest in holding an anti-drug summit  so that in the Andean area we can give new impetus to the dialogue on cooperation and agree with the United States and the European Union on a single consensus strategy  which would be mutually beneficial for the Andean producer countries and the large consumer markets.  Another universal scourge that the international community must fight unrelentingly is terrorism. Peru reiterates that terrorism  whatever its form or manifestation  or its motivation  is unacceptable and accordingly must be condemned and fought. States must show an unequivocal attitude towards terrorism. Peru therefore supports the efforts being made in the United Nations to fight terrorism. Among them  we note the approval of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We reaffirm our conviction that this struggle can and must be carried out with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  In the Millennium Declaration we set ourselves the target of attaining by 2015 various goals in the fight against poverty and in the partnership for development  goals which summarize the challenges that countries such as Peru must tackle and overcome and the cooperation that developed countries must give in assisting development  trade and financing. However  at the 2005 World Summit we noted that progress in compliance with the Millennium Development Goals is somewhat modest  and some goals seem unattainable.   In order to comply with the Millennium Development Goals  the Government of Peru has taken immediate action  including  first  reform of the State and the political system to give it more austerity  through decentralization  administrative simplification and moral initiatives; secondly  job creation through investment and the opportunities that the State must promote; thirdly  restoration of labour and social rights in order to have a more modern and just society; fourthly  policies in favour of women  youth and children; and  fifthly  civic security to give the population tranquillity and confidence. None of that will be enough if the markets of developed countries remain closed to our products through restrictions. In    06-53609 22  this context  we call for the prompt resumption of the Doha Round talks in a spirit of compromise.  My Government’s social policy initiatives will make possible a broader exercise of human rights. I refer in particular to economic  social and cultural rights  where shortcomings are evident  and to paying particular attention to the most vulnerable groups.   In this respect  during the current session we will be called upon to consider and possibly adopt three important international instruments on promoting and protecting human rights. The first two are the draft declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples and the draft international convention on the rights of persons with disabilities. Peru urges every Member State to consider adopting these two instruments  which would give greater protection to millions of people who today are victims of marginalization. The third instrument is the draft convention on forced disappearance  which will make it possible to more effectively combat that reprehensible practice.  We are aware of the importance of multilateralism as the ideal context for low- and medium-income countries to take part in the international arena  as well as helping to find solutions to the challenges that the globalized world must face. These challenges result from the current characteristics of the international system  in which two opposing processes coexist. Thus  while the world integrates globally it is becoming more fragmented because of an increase in social inequality  the proliferation of civil conflicts and the disintegration of States  so-called ethnic cleansing  massive violations of human rights  the trafficking of people and arms  environmental degradation  terrorism and international organized crime.   These contradictory trends between globalization and fragmentation often call into question both the ability of States to govern and international stability  the major challenges that the international community  and in particular the Security Council  must face. Therefore  we need a comprehensive and strategic vision to make it possible to deal with problems affecting international peace and security. It is not only military aspects that cause crises. There are also structural factors  such as poverty  social exclusion and environmental degradation  which are the triggers of national and international instability.  If the Council does not take this reality into account it will be very difficult to prevent or resolve conflicts in a sustainable way  because it will mean putting to one side the most important variables. We therefore acknowledge the need to make the multilateral system more flexible  comprehensive and effective  in order to tackle the global challenges and threats. But  at the same time  the Security Council’s actions must be based on legitimacy  which accords the strictest respect for the values  purposes and principles of the Charter and international law. With this conviction  Peru is taking part in the Security Council in a coherent way and with a constructive spirit.  Given this premise  it is crucial to strengthen the disarmament and non-proliferation regimes and to find a peaceful solution to disputes. We supported the peacekeeping interventions authorized by the Security Council  and we will continue those efforts to ensure a renewed collective security system supported and respected by all Member States  in order to tackle threats to international peace and security. It is in this context that we see Peru’s participation in peacekeeping operations in Haiti  Sudan  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Eritrea  Ethiopia  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire  Burundi and Cyprus. This involves very sensitive matters and arduous responsibilities  but we assume them as a natural corollary to the commitment to international peace and security that we made when signing the Charter. We affirm our confidence that the Peacebuilding Commission will achieve the objective of supporting the reconstruction of countries emerging from conflict.   At the same time  we believe that we must step up our prevention efforts at the regional and subregional levels  which is why Peru promotes cooperative security through mechanisms to strengthen peace and security structures  whose development includes the need to prevent arms races between neighbouring countries.  Peru supports reform of the Security Council to make it more effective  transparent and representative. In this process  we favour increasing the number of members through dialogue and consensus  as part of a comprehensive process of United Nations reform  in which we have already seen some progress. The road ahead must be tackled with greater responsibility and in a spirit of dialogue and openness.   23 06-53609   I wanted to share these concerns and ideas in order to reaffirm that Peru  on the basis of its own economic and social reality and its regional outreach  as well as its profound multilateral vocation  wishes to continue to contribute constructively to security  development and respect for human rights in the world. We are convinced that the United Nations system can  with the help of all  strengthen its central role of promoting social progress and raising the standard of living within the broadest concept of freedom  as stipulated in the Preamble to the Charter.

"137",5590,"PHL",61,2006,"It gives me great pleasure  Madam  to extend to you the felicitations of my Government and our people  and my own congratulations  on your well-deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly. My delegation stands ready to extend to you its fullest cooperation  not only as a member of your Bureau  but as a close friend of Bahrain as well. Your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  has left an indelible impression on the United Nations. Under his leadership  we were able to carry out a substantial part of the package of reforms mandated by the largest gathering of world leaders  as set out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1).  Last year  our leaders met to commemorate 60 years of the United Nations. That meeting gave all of us renewed hopes for peace  growth  progress and the pre-eminence of the rights of all peoples. Those hopes remain  even in the face of continuing threats to the peace and security of mankind posed by terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons; even in the face of grinding poverty and financial uncertainty; even in the face of intolerance and misunderstanding; and  certainly  in the face of the fast-changing nature of our world.   Those hopes remain because the spirit of cooperation and community  which lies at the very heart of our Charter  lives on. Cooperation remains the key to reaching the goals set by our Charter. Cooperation  according to a twentieth-century philosopher  is the only thing that will redeem mankind.  It is in that spirit that the Philippines welcomes and supports the continued work of the Middle East Quartet and its call this week for greater progress towards a just and comprehensive peace. We strongly support the Road Map to peace and maintain our hopes for the realization of the vision of two democratic States  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security.  Together with the other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  we were gravely concerned over the deteriorating situation and the escalation of violence in the Middle East  particularly the disproportionate  indiscriminate and excessive use of force in Lebanon. The United Nations peacekeeping operation now under way in Lebanon renews our hope for peace and offers a great opportunity for the United Nations to demonstrate its relevance and its impact on the world stage.  Our own quest for peace in the Philippines is boldly moving forward  thanks to the support and cooperation of key members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and other members of the international community.  Our own experience as a country is convincing proof of the efficacy of collective action in fighting terrorism. Working closely with our neighbours and others  we are ridding our country of terrorists. The recent adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) will help to strike another blow against terrorists. I commend the Permanent Representatives of Spain and Singapore for having successfully steered the negotiations on the Strategy.   One of the anchors of the Strategy is an initiative that is a primary concern of my country: the promotion of interfaith dialogue and cooperation. In pursuit of that initiative  the Philippines organized and chaired two key meetings held yesterday here at the United Nations: the First Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and the High-level Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace. As founder and current Chair of the Tripartite Forum on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace — a new movement of Governments  United Nations agencies and religious non-governmental organizations accredited to the United Nations — the Philippines will initiate the holding of another high-level tripartite conference  this time to focus on the issue of small arms and light weapons.   In addition  the Philippines announced last week  at the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement  that we will organize and convene a special ministerial meeting on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for peace in the city of Davao  in southern Philippines. Meanwhile  I commend Spain and Turkey for their new initiative on the Alliance of Civilizations. I believe that it will   27 06-53323  complement and reinforce  in a mutually inclusive manner  the Philippine initiative on interfaith dialogue and cooperation for peace.  We have barely nine years left to achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)  set by our leaders  of cutting poverty in half by 2015. That target could remain a mere vision if no effective mechanism for resource mobilization is found. It is in that context that the Philippine initiative on debt for equity in MDG projects was launched last year; I thank the Group of 77 and China for its support. This initiative does not call for debt cancellation  a debt moratorium or debt reduction; it merely calls for the use of part of the payments from the debt stock of low- and medium-income developing countries not eligible under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative as equity for creditors in MDG projects in areas such as infrastructure  education  employment and health.  Multilateral cooperation in the field of energy security continues to grow in importance. Alternative sources of energy have to be developed. My delegation recommends that the Secretary-General appoint a group of eminent persons to look into this matter. The output of such a group should be the subject of a high-level dialogue before the current session ends.   One of the historic achievements of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly was the decision to establish the Central Emergency Response Fund for the rapid deployment of relief and assistance to countries stricken by natural disasters. The Philippines ranks third globally in terms of the number of people exposed to earthquakes and tropical cyclones annually. For that reason  the Philippines calls on all nations to support the Fund. We also call for enhanced cooperation aimed at effective responses to natural disasters.  International migration and development was the subject of last week’s High-level Dialogue. That is an issue that is close to our hearts. Approximately one tenth of the population of the Philippines lives overseas. We are the largest supplier of seafarers  and our land-based workers can be found in practically all parts of the world.   Bearing that in mind  the Philippines joined the call for the creation of an informal global forum on migration and development as an outcome of the High-level Dialogue  provisionally outside the umbrella of the United Nations  to enable the international community to continue the dialogue on important issues relating to migration. My delegation invites Member States to accede to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in order to demonstrate and reaffirm the universality of human rights.   For my country and its people  human rights and the sanctity of the life of the individual are of paramount value. For my Government  the protection of human life is a sacred commitment. Last week  the Philippines renewed that commitment through the signing of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Enshrined in our constitution is powerful language against the death penalty. Three months ago  President Arroyo gave that constitutional mandate further expression when she signed into law Republic Act 9346  which removed the death penalty from our statute books.  Such is the value that we assign to life that  in our constitution  we are bound to protect the life of the unborn child. Through the signing of the Second Optional Protocol  the Philippine Government re-emphasized its unrelenting commitment to strengthening the protection of human rights.  I should like to take this opportunity to express the profound appreciation of the Philippines and of ASEAN to the outgoing Secretary-General  Kofi Annan  for his dedicated and tireless service to the United Nations. He leaves behind a more invigorated and dynamic Organization  a legacy of reform with new and needed institutions such as the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  and an eloquent recommitment on the part of the United Nations and its membership to alleviating the plight of the less fortunate through the articulation of the Millennium Development Goals.   The Philippines is particularly appreciative of Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s support and cooperation during our recent term as a Security Council member during the biennium 2004-2005 and for his steadfast support for the Philippines interfaith dialogue initiative.  Two world wars ago  Mr. Woodrow Wilson  an advocate of a global organization  defined power in terms that are still relevant today. He said: “Power    06-53323 28  consists in one’s capacity to link his will with the purpose of others  to lead by reason and a gift of cooperation”. The drafters of our Charter and the challenges of the present provide us with the reason. We must now find within ourselves  as nations and as peoples  the gift of cooperation. "
"138",5609,"PLW",61,2006,"Let me begin by offering my congratulations to you  Madam President. We would also like to thank former Assembly President Jan Eliasson for his able leadership over the past year. Our   deep appreciation also goes to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  who has served the Organization with skill and devotion.  Palau joins others in welcoming Montenegro  the newest State Member of the United Nations. We look forward to its participation in our debates.   Participation in the United Nations has special meaning for Palau. We were the last country to emerge from the United Nations Trusteeship System. During trusteeship  it was the United Nations that showed us that every country  regardless of size  had a role to play. The United Nations provided our nation with a platform from which we could achieve independence and establish our sovereignty. For that we are forever grateful.  Palau is often seen as a paradise of swaying palm trees and ocean breezes. But that simplistic view fails to recognize the challenges we face as a small island developing State. In this shrinking world  the actions of distant countries are having a profound effect on us. We come to the Assembly now  asking for its help once again as we face those difficult issues.  One of the issues that we hope the General Assembly will act on this year is deep-sea bottom trawling. As the Secretary-General has reported  bottom trawling is responsible for 95 per cent of the worldwide damage to seamount ecosystems. It is an irresponsible practice  and Palau has passed a law banning all bottom trawling within our waters. In doing so  Palau followed the lead set by Japan  the United States  Norway  Australia and many other responsible countries.  It is now time to ensure that similar measures are taken for international waters. That is why Palau has joined with our Pacific colleagues in Tuvalu  the Marshall Islands and Micronesia to propose an interim prohibition on unregulated bottom trawling. Our proposal represents the strong determination of our region to protect the oceans upon which we all ultimately rely.  Another issue of great importance is that of global warming. Coral bleaching  a rise in sea level and altered fish migration all threaten the future of Palau and other small island nations. Reversing that trend is one of our top priorities. We continue to urge the international community to act aggressively to reduce emissions that lead to global warming.    06-53317 18   Palau is a democratic society. Our children know the importance of culture and community. We guarantee human rights in our nation. We also know that flying our flag here at the United Nations carries with it certain obligations  and we have met them all. Palau has deployed peacekeepers to regional and international missions. When natural disasters strike  Palau responds willingly and voluntarily. When the international community called upon countries to preserve biodiversity  Palau came forward with the Micronesian Challenge. That initiative will protect 462 coral species  which represent 58 per cent of all known corals.  Our future as a nation and the future of our children depend upon the viability of our environment  especially of the oceans. Palau relies on the health of its amazing reefs and waters to provide food for our people and to support our tourism industry. Without those we will not be able to develop a sustainable economy that will allow our children to live and work in their homeland. To provide for them  we look to the United Nations for leadership and support. To that end  Palau remains open to ideas for harmonizing the environmental agencies at the United Nations. We applaud efforts to streamline the process of accessing those agencies; that would make them more responsive to small nations. In the same vein  Palau would like to state that difficulties in accessing assistance in claiming our extended continental shelf have made it clear that we will have a hard time meeting the 2009 deadline for submissions.  Last year  in this historic Hall  we noted our concern that the United Nations  its offices and organizations did not have a permanent representative in Palau. In June  it was announced that a coalition comprised of the United Nations Development Programme  UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund would open a total of eight new offices in Pacific island countries  including Palau. We welcome that historic accomplishment. It is a giant step towards harmonization within the United Nations. For Palau  it will give us one of the tools we need most for sustainable development  namely  local capacity-building.  Let us not forget the continuing threat of terrorism. We recognize that terrorism anywhere is a threat to people everywhere. We have looked for assistance to improve our anti-terrorism capacity. Palau has met  and worked with  the Counter-terrorism Executive Directorate to advance our requests for assistance  particularly in the area of combating money-laundering and the financing of terrorism. Unfortunately  the efforts of the Directorate have been insufficient. Our hope is that  during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  the United Nations will be able to help smaller countries in addressing that threat.  We would also like to take a moment to thank a few of the many partners that have assisted Palau this past year. The efforts of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Small Grants Programme deserve special recognition. The GEF programme in the North Pacific has resulted in an effective mechanism to protect our environment through grass-roots projects.   Palau has also partnered with a number of countries that have supported our development. First  the United States has provided in-country diplomatic representation and years of support. We acknowledge the generosity of the United States in responding to natural disasters in Asia and the Pacific region. We thank them for that. Japan has also provided invaluable assistance to Palau. The addition of Japan as a member of the Security Council would help inform other Council members that are less familiar with our regional needs and concerns. We have supported  and continue to support  the G-4 draft resolution  and hope that the Assembly will address the draft resolution this year.  Taiwan has been another steady supporter of Palau’s development. We continue to assert that the world would benefit from Taiwan’s membership in the United Nations and other international institutions. This year  Palau co-sponsored a draft resolution calling for a proactive role for the United Nations in addressing the tensions in East Asia. We were disappointed that the actions of the General Committee prevented a debate on that draft resolution.  Palau would also like to recognize Australia’s steadfast commitment to stability in our region  as well as its dedication to capacity-building. Through such initiatives as its patrol boat programme  Australia enables Palau to address illegal  unregulated and unreported fishing  which threatens our sovereignty and the marine habitats that surround our island nation.  We call on all parties in the Sudan to work together to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. As Mr. Jan Eliasson stated on 11 September     19 06-53317   “we have ... seen the horrors of Cambodia  Rwanda and Srebrenica without taking action. The same tragedy must not befall the people in Darfur or elsewhere. The responsibility to protect must move from declaration to action.” (A/60/PV.100  p. 6 )  Lastly  Palau would like to take this opportunity to express our hope that the Middle East peace process can be successfully restarted. We are hopeful that the expanded United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) will bring peace and security to both Israel and Lebanon. We stress the need for full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006)  including its preamble. We join the call for the unconditional release of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers. It is critical that the reconstructed UNIFIL force be effective and capable of enforcing the arms embargo as called for.  On behalf of Palau  a small island nation in the wide Pacific Ocean  let me thank the entire Assembly in my country’s native language. Kom Kmal Mesulang. God bless you all. "
"139",5650,"PNG",61,2006,"I wish to convey Papua New Guinea’s congratulations to you  Madam President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I assure you of my country’s full cooperation during your presidency. We compliment your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his stewardship of our work during his tenure. We also congratulate him on his appointment as Sweden’s Foreign Minister and wish him well.  On 10 October 1975  24 days after Papua New Guinea attained political independence  I stood at this very rostrum and addressed the Assembly with a lot of hope and expectations. Like many developing countries coming out from the colonial yoke  Papua New Guinea committed itself to the principles and purposes of the United Nations. I said: “I state our fundamental commitment to the maintenance of peace throughout our world and our undertaking to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations Organization.”  We believed that the United Nations was the most appropriate body to achieve our aspirations of meaningful economic development  respect for our sovereignty and the attainment of a peaceful and secure world. The harsh reality today is that these aspirations remain largely unfulfilled for many of us. Our record will indicate lost opportunities to realize the promise of a better world.  Our world today is marked by an inequitable global trading order and a hostile security environment. Wanton globalization and unfettered trade liberalization are affecting many of us in ways that are detrimental to the livelihood of our people. Unilateral actions by the big and powerful to resolve disputes are no longer incidental  but are the order of the day. We note the increasing incidence of human atrocities  genocides  wars  poverty  terrorism  the emergence of HIV/AIDS  and an increase in malaria and tuberculosis. Our streets and communities are littered with small arms and light weapons. The smuggling of drugs and humans and other illegal activities are on the rise. Environmental degradation and climate change continue unabated. We must confront these issues urgently. To complement efforts in other forums  Papua New Guinea  with other countries of the Pacific region  has agreed to pool its limited resources under the Pacific plan to address these issues.  Papua New Guinea continues to believe that the United Nations offers the best hope for its Member States to address these ongoing concerns and other emerging challenges facing humanity today. In this regard  my country supports the ongoing United Nations reform initiatives that seek to make its   21 06-52879  operations more effective and responsive. We must ensure that its collective security mandates and functions  and its various organizations  are strengthened and not weakened. We are pleased to note the establishment of the Human Rights Council and Peacebuilding Commission. Papua New Guinea believes in a revitalized General Assembly whose role and authority reflect its broad membership. We must press on with the reform of the Security Council with courage and boldness so that it reflects the political and economic realities of today. An expanded Security Council must be more democratic and transparent. Its membership must include developing countries  while maintaining geographic balance and representation.  Global trade today is characterized more by the unfair practices of those already holding decided advantages than by the opportunities it offers to developing countries such as Papua New Guinea. Our efforts to develop a more equitable trading order are hampered by the reluctance of our developed partners to open their economies and engage in genuine development discussions. Adding insult to injury  many of our developed partners have yet to meet the targets they agreed with respect to Official Development Assistance.  While we appreciate the efforts of some of our developed partners to ease the burden of debt under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative  we are disappointed that many of them have not shown the same leadership on the Doha Development Round  leading to its collapse. We are calling for developing countries to join us in framing a new and true development round. We must exercise leadership rather than passively allowing others to chart our future.  Despite these difficulties  Papua New Guinea is pursuing economic development programmes that are based on an export-driven economic growth strategy. At the heart of this policy objective is the focus on rural development. We have developed a five-year medium-term development strategy and aligned it with the Millennium Development Goals. Achieving those goals by 2015 is a tremendous challenge for Papua New Guinea but we have taken the first step in providing budget funding for its implementation. We call for the support of the United Nations system and other genuine development partners to meet these vital commitments.  As a result of better policy coordination  stricter implementation of structural reform and prudent financial and economic management  Papua New Guinea has attained macroeconomic and fiscal stability. Our economy is growing  interest rates have fallen  and the exchange rate has been stabilized. Our foreign exchange reserves are at an all-time high. We are using these gains to reinvest in productive sectors of our economy and in delivering services to our people. Development partners must play a supportive role to sustain these gains. This can be done through fair trade opportunities  equitable markets  increased foreign investment  transfer of technology  capacity-building and providing quality overseas development assistance.  I now turn to an issue about which my country feels strongly  that of climate change and sea-level rise. For us this is not academic  it is reality. Small islands and low-lying atolls in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific region are being submerged by rising sea levels. As I speak  my own people are being resettled to higher ground. Papua New Guinea’s strong position on the environment is drawn from the preamble to our national Constitution  which states:  “We declare our fourth goal to be for Papua New Guinea’s natural resources and environment to be conserved and used for the collective benefit of us all  and be replenished for the benefit of future generations.” That constitutional imperative underpins my country’s whole approach to sustainable development objectives  including those contained in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Mauritius Strategy.  Environmental degradation is occurring at a frightening pace. Scientific studies suggest that climate change is causing increasing incidences of environmental catastrophes such as hurricanes  tsunamis  landslides and flash floods. Our planet is in distress. As co-inhabitants of this world we must all equally share responsibility to address the root causes of this problem. We urge industrialized countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We call upon those that have not yet done so to accede to and ratify the Kyoto Protocol.  Papua New Guinea is prepared to play its part to protect and conserve the world’s tropical rainforest with the aim of stabilizing the earth’s climate. The findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate    06-52879 22  Change suggest that an estimated 20 per cent to 25 per cent of annual global emissions were generated through land-use change  primarily from the degradation of forest resources. In this context it is crucial for us to protect the tropical rainforests through sustainable and fair market-based incentives.  The dilemma is that for some of us the forestry sector is a major revenue earner  a provider of much-needed employment  a facilitator of important infrastructure projects  and a catalyst for the provision of basic services in rural areas. The present incentives offered by international markets for agriculture  forestry and emissions reductions are inadequate. These are perverse incentives from the standpoint of the environment. Papua New Guinea  along with Costa Rica  has formed a new Coalition for Rainforest Nations that includes many other countries in Africa  Asia  Latin America and the Pacific. Together we are pursuing an initiative to access global carbon markets and to support efforts to reduce rates of deforestation. Simply put  this approach seeks to recognize the contribution of resource owners to conserving and protecting rainforests for the benefit of mankind. We invite more nations to join our efforts to create new markets and reform outmoded market and regulatory mechanisms. That is necessary if we are to contribute more effectively towards environmental sustainability  economic development  climate stability and poverty reduction.  The initiative on deforestation is part of a broader agenda being pursued by my Government to implement the Millennium Development Goal to ensure environmental sustainability. We are convinced that by implementing the seventh goal we will harness our ability to achieve environmentally and socially sustainable economic growth. Many times developing countries are drawn into false promises of international investment. Often we find our natural resources exploited  leaving us with neither the resource nor the money. We will not allow this to continue. We want wealth from our natural resources to remain within our nations to fuel our economic growth.  The threat of HIV/AIDS is real in many of our countries and has serious implications for social and economic development. In Papua New Guinea my Government has passed HIV/AIDS legislation  underpinned by a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy framework. To ensure close scrutiny I have vested my department with the responsibility of overseeing implementation. In addition  I have appointed a special minister to assist me in providing political leadership on this particular issue. But our experience suggests that national action alone is not enough. It requires a concerted global response. This is a war that must be waged on all fronts and by all countries. We thank the United Nations and its related agencies for their efforts to address this issue. We also applaud the bold leadership of former United States President Mr. Bill Clinton and of Mr. Bill Gates in this regard.  Of equal importance are the battles against malaria  tuberculosis and other preventable diseases. While we  as a global community  have focused on HIV/AIDS and bird flu  this has diluted our attention to malaria  which remains the biggest killer disease in my country. I call upon our development partners to support Papua New Guinea and other countries in maintaining perspective on these challenges.  Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is a serious threat to international peace and security. It must be condemned irrespective of who perpetrates it. All countries and peoples of the world have a serious responsibility to stand united and fight this evil. However  Papua New Guinea is concerned about the erosion of the international community’s moral authority to address this issue. It is unhelpful to our credibility if certain of our members choose to address this issue in flagrant violation of international norms and universally agreed conventions. As with other cross-border challenges  Member States will require the support of the United Nations and development partners with capacity-building and other necessary resources to effectively fight global terrorism.  The conflict in the Middle East  despite various United Nations resolutions  remains unresolved. Papua New Guinea appeals to all parties to the conflict  including those Powers with the capacity to influence a positive outcome  to make the hard concessions necessary for a peaceful resolution of this long-standing issue. The recent confrontation in Lebanon resulted in the loss of innocent lives and massive destruction to infrastructure. Papua New Guinea appeals for restraint by all parties and urges that full use be made of the dispute settlement procedures of the United Nations. Comprehensive and lasting solutions must be found to the issues that led to the conflict. Neighbouring countries and the international community as a whole can make positive contributions by shepherding a process that allows for genuine   23 06-52879  dialogue to take place. We commend the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and European countries such as France  Italy and Germany and others that are contributing troops to maintain the ceasefire.  Papua New Guinea is extremely concerned about the proliferation among States of nuclear  chemical  biological and other weapons of mass destruction. We continue to maintain that there is no real justification for the retention and further development of these instruments of war. We call upon all countries to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and other related treaties to reduce the threat to international peace and security by weapons of mass destruction. Sadly  we were reminded by the Secretary-General yesterday of the apathy that surrounds actions on non-proliferation and disarmament.  The work of the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization remains unfinished. We still have 16 non-self-governing territories  some in the Pacific  that are yet to exercise their right to self-determination. The referendum in Tokelau demonstrated a true spirit of cooperation between Tokelau and New Zealand. We congratulate both Governments and assure the people of Tokelau of our respect for their decision to remain in free association with New Zealand.  I conclude by saying that the world has changed in ways that not only provide opportunities  but also offer more complex challenges for Members of the United Nations. The emergence of a trend over the years to try to resolve these challenges outside the principles and framework prescribed by the United Nations has resulted in a world worse than the founders of the Organization envisaged. We must renew our commitment and faith in the United Nations and seek to reform it in ways that reflect the realities of today.  At this juncture I take the opportunity to pay a special tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his outstanding contribution to the United Nations and the world. We wish him well. As this is likely to be the last General Assembly session in which I take part  I take this opportunity to thank all those who have contributed in one way or another in support of Papua New Guinea since independence. When I brought my nation to take its seat in this Assembly 31 years ago I said  and I reaffirm today  that within the limits of our resources Papua New Guinea will play an active and positive role in the United Nations. "
"140",5696,"POL",61,2006,"Let me begin by extending my congratulations to Her Excellency Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa from the Kingdom of Bahrain on the occasion of her election as President of the General Assembly in its sixty-first session. I wish you  Madam  every success in carrying out this important mission.  To the former President  His Excellency Jan Eliasson  Minister for Foreign Affairs from the Kingdom of Sweden  I convey my respect for his outstanding achievements in running the previous session.  I convey my best wishes to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. I would like to express my profound respect and full support for his incessant efforts in continuing to reduce international tension and resolve international conflicts.  The matters we have gathered here to discuss today are very important for the world  for Europe  for Poland and for me personally. I am saying this as President and as a member of Solidarity — the movement that completely changed my country.  Solidarity gave Poland her freedom and sovereignty  and also contributed to the fall of Communism in Europe. Thanks to Solidarity  a wall dividing the world into two hostile camps was brought down. We  the Poles  perceive global partnership for development — the theme of this year’s session of the United Nations — through the lens of our historical experiences — the experiences of the Solidarity movement.  The Polish Solidarity movement originated from an idea that is a universal value in various cultures  religions and traditions. This value must be rediscovered in order to help build a new world based on the right of all nations and all peoples to live in dignity.  Poland’s heritage is inextricably connected with the heritage of Europe — one that is founded on a respect for human rights and love of freedom.  Like many other countries over the course of history  we have experienced disasters like those that  unfortunately  continue to affect the everyday lives of millions of people on various continents. For many years  we suffered from wars  destruction  poverty  a lack of freedom and a loss of independence. Today  in a free country where we have been implementing essential reforms for more than a decade  we are making up for lost time. Although we sometimes make mistakes trying to improve on those reforms  we continue to make progress. We wish to share with others our experience of profound transformation.  Poland’s experience in shaking off a totalitarian regime and taking up the task of modernizing the country gives us a special understanding of the needs of countries following a similar path. That is why we are committed to doing our utmost to spread democracy and freedom around the world. Today  Poland is a rapidly developing country. We are becoming a nation that is able to donate to the international community  much to our satisfaction. Until recently  we were the beneficiary of such aid. Indeed  I should like Poland to become even more active in that regard.  Today  in the twenty-first century  Poland is a strong sovereign State and an active member of the European Union  as well as an ally of the United States of America. Having overcome painful historical experiences  Poland has been developing friendly relations with its neighbours since 1989  opening a new chapter in its relations with Germany. We also want the best possible relationship with our great neighbour Russia. We are hopeful  yet sometimes concerned  about the developments in that country.  Poland  a member of the European Union for more than two years  supports the Union’s approach to cooperation with the United Nations. We are convinced that peace must be built through long-term sustainable development. It is in that conviction that we take action in the United Nations with regard to the Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals. We also support our eastern neighbours in their reform efforts. Poland  which paved the way for a market economy  the democratic rule of law and a civil society in Central and Eastern Europe  has extensive experience in those areas. We are prepared to share that experience further with countries that are transforming their economies and State institutions.  Together with our European partners  we are shaping the political  social and economic future of our continent. However  because Poland is aware that Europe is not the whole world  we are participating in stabilization and peacekeeping missions around the world  including those in Kosovo  Afghanistan  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Lebanon and Iraq.   23 06-52731   We strongly encourage efforts to bring a lasting peace to the Middle East. A few days ago  I had the opportunity to express Poland’s position in that regard. Poland unequivocally supports Israel’s right to live in security. At the same time  Poland supports the aspirations of the Palestinian nation to build an independent State. We have been involved in the stabilization of the region for many years. We actively participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. Two weeks ago  at the request of the Secretary-General  we stated that we would increase our military contingent. If necessary  we will increase it even further.  For Poland  the difficult and painful period of our history belongs to the past. I wish to reiterate that our experiences have left us with a sense of moral obligation to help others. We want to repay our debt. Just as we once received support  we now want to support others.  In seeking to provide the most effective forms of assistance  the international community must take into account the phenomenon of globalization  which has become the challenge of the twenty-first century. Although it understandably gives rise to various emotions and extreme opinions  its significance is indisputable. Globalization has revealed the scale and the nature of problems of which we had not been fully aware. I am thinking about the ever-increasing inequalities and exclusion from the achievements of civilization and about the vast areas of poverty and instability that are breeding grounds for crime and increase the threats to peace and security.  It is also difficult not to fear the negative effects of globalization: the division of the world into countries that are becoming ever richer and those that are condemned to ever-deepening poverty. The response to these fears must be global solidarity. We can scarcely fail to see the dramatic contradiction between such poverty and the affluence made possible by incredible scientific and technological progress.  What is solidarity in the global context? Very briefly  it is the collective reaction against the emergence of new iron curtains and political  economic and cultural barriers; it is also respect for the dignity and the inalienable right to freedom of every human being throughout the world  regardless of culture  tradition or geographic location. Understood in that way  solidarity is a rational fight against poverty  carried out by encouraging a broad flow of assistance to the poorest countries through appropriately planned economic support. Assistance efforts must be undertaken in such a way as to ensure not only that they provide short-term relief  but also  and above all  that they permit long-term development. Thus  we should work out a reform programme to make such development possible.  Here  I should like to draw attention to the issue of energy security  which is increasingly important in many regions of the world. Energy security should be based on the diversification of energy sources and on the development of energy relationships that cannot be used as a means of political pressure.  Assistance provided in the context of global solidarity has an economic aspect. Freedom and respect for the rights of the individual are essential conditions for sustainable well-being. Assistance in the context of global solidarity also implies support for societies striving to achieve freedom  democracy and the protection of human rights — support that is provided with wisdom and that is sensitive to the cultural uniqueness  traditions and needs of each country.  I believe that where tensions and social conflicts are resolved through dialogue  where respect is promoted for different cultures and religions and where economic inequalities between societies and States are prevented  terrorism will not find soil in which to grow. I also wish to express my conviction that here and now  in the contemporary world  we must fight terrorism wherever it appears. In the long run  however  global solidarity may be the most effective weapon against those who would like to see the world as the scene of a never-ending fight.  The United Nations today needs specific programmes to realize ambitious visions founded on global solidarity and a global partnership for development. The United Nations must be more effective in ensuring equal development opportunities  thus closing the gap between the living standards of the North and of the South.  The United Nations is thus confronted with huge tasks  which require both high-minded commitment and reforms. We want changes that adapt the United Nations to contemporary challenges. The world is constantly changing  and the United Nations must keep pace with those changes. Only thus can it preserve its significance and multiply its great achievements.    06-52731 24  Reforms must be focused on the human being  thus defending human rights and freedoms and opening the way to well-being and spiritual development for all. Those were the founding values of the United Nations over 60 years ago.  Poland advocates such a reform of the Organization and is ready to participate in it. Poland also wishes to participate in a restructuring of international relations that would be based to a greater extent on the principles of solidarity and assistance extended by wealthy nations to nations in need. In other words  the quantity of such support should be significantly greater than it is now.  These words of that great Pole  Pope John Paul II  the spiritual father of Polish solidarity  can be our guiding beacon: “Man is great not through what he   owns  but through what he is; not through what he has  but through what he shares with others.”  We are facing tremendous challenges. We can tackle them only by acting in solidarity through global partnership. May our efforts be inspired by solidarity  a principle embodied in a word that appears in all the world’s languages — and in many of them it sounds very much the same. "
"141",5722,"PRK",61,2006,"Allow me first  on behalf of my delegation  to congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President and to express my conviction that the session will be successful under her able leadership.  The desire of humankind for a peaceful and prosperous world in the new century is still faced with grave challenges. The unilateralism and high-handed acts of the super-Power are becoming so reckless as to trample on the principles of respect for the sovereign equality of all States  the fundamental basis of the United Nations Charter  thereby arousing international society’s serious concern. Worse still are the invasions of sovereign States  either openly committed or disregarded  and even fanned under the pretext of non-proliferation and anti-terrorism  giving rise to the massacre of innocent people and the destruction of international peace and security.  The threats and high-handed acts of the super-Power are becoming more and more obvious  with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as their target. The United States adventurous military manoeuvres  such as military exercises and an economic blockade of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  continue to be tolerated  while the routine missile test-firings of our army for self-defence have been condemned as a threat to international peace and security. Such a reality is a serious lesson to us all that a country with powerful strength  a just deterrent  is capable of safeguarding the dignity and sovereignty of a nation by itself.   Herein lies the necessity and justness of the Songun policy of General Kim Jong Il  the respected leader of our people. The Songun policy is a sure guarantee of the ability of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to safeguard its sovereignty and security and ensure peace and stability on the Korean peninsula  and in the region as a whole  in the face of the ever-hardening  hostile policy of the United States towards it. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s possession of deterrent power  solely for self-defence  is also fully in line with the interest of the countries of the region in peace and security and a peaceful environment.  As is well known  the Korean people have suffered a tragic history; after the nearly half-century-long tyrannical military occupation by Japan they have been living in a state of war with the United States for 60 years. Against this background  the Korean people aspire for peace more than any other country. Today there persist on the Korean peninsula touch-and-go critical tension and confrontation  rather than durable peace and security. The source is none other than the vicious  hostile policy of the United States towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.   The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is not exceptional either  as it originates from United States nuclear threats. The United States policy towards the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has gone beyond mere hostility  going so far as to pose nuclear threats  even by designating it part of an “axis of evil” and the target of pre-emptive strikes  thus driving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to inevitably possess a nuclear deterrent. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea maintains its consistent position of seeking to resolve the issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula peacefully through dialogue and negotiation.  As the world knows well  the core elements stipulated in the Joint Statement of 19 September 2005  adopted at the six-party talks  are the respective commitments of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States to abandon its nuclear programme and to live in peaceful coexistence. As for the Joint Statement  the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains committed to implementing all its agreed provisions on an equal footing. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is sure to get greater benefit from implementation of the agreed provisions of the talks. That is why it is willing  more than any other country  to hold the talks. However  the United States  soon after the announcement of that Joint Statement  wasted no time in imposing financial sanctions upon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  a dialogue partner  eventually scrapping the   27 06-53609  already agreed itinerary for the following rounds of the Talks and creating the present impasse.  In view of these facts  it is crystal clear that the United States is not in favour of the six-party talks and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. If there is anything that the United States does favour  it is aggravated tension on the Korean peninsula  to be used as a pretext to reinforce its military forces in the north-east Asian region. By doing so  the United States aims to strengthen its armed forces in the region and thus contain the ever-growing  strong Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and neighbouring countries within its world supremacy strategy. That is the real intention of the United States.   It is quite preposterous that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea  under the groundless United States sanctions  takes part in the Talks to discuss its own nuclear abandonment. That is the matter of principle on which even the slightest concession cannot be tolerated. I take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to Member States of the United Nations for their continued support for and encouragement of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in its efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.  As for Korea’s reunification  it is the supreme aspiration of our nation to realize it at the earliest possible date as a prerequisite to ensuring lasting peace and security on the Korean peninsula. The North-South Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000 is a declaration on realizing independence and peaceful reunification by the Korean nation itself  rejecting foreign interference. Regrettably  however  on 21 September the South Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade made distorted remarks about the root causes of the tension in the Korean peninsula  without saying a single word about implementation of the North-South Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000. That causes us consternation.   It is already well known that the major factors undermining peace and stability and aggravating tension in the Korean peninsula are the United States military presence in South Korea; its doctrine of pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; incessant large-scale joint United States and South Korea military exercises; the mass delivery to South Korea of all sorts of military equipment  including weapons of mass destruction; and aerial reconnaissance carried out by the United States a hundred-odd times every month.  The North-South Joint Declaration of 15 June has not been smoothly implemented so far  because of the persistent manoeuvres of the United States  which dislikes improved inter-Korean relations  and because of the existence in South Korea of such legal mechanisms as the national security law stipulating fellow countrymen as enemies and denying even basic human rights  which is against the ideals of “By our nation itself”  the core of the Joint Declaration. Those are undeniable facts.   By upholding the banner of the North-South Joint Declaration  and under the ideals of “By our nation itself”  the Government of our Republic will surely achieve national reunification by firmly realizing cooperation in the three areas of national independence  peace against war  and patriotism for reunification.   For the United Nations to fulfil its mission for the maintenance of international peace and security  practical measures should be taken to reject unilateralism and high-handed acts that block the establishment of equitable and just international relations. Furthermore  the United Nations should be democratized so that all international issues are resolved in conformity with the common interests of Member States.   In this regard  we are of the view that one of the reasonable ways to effect that is to hand over from the Security Council to the General Assembly the power to pass resolutions on issues directly linked to international peace and security  such as the use of force. It is also imperative to ensure that the Security Council  responsible for international peace and security  strictly observe the principle of fairness in its activities. It should be accountable to the General Assembly by making a real contribution to international peace and security  not a means for certain countries to legalize their strategic interests.   The fact that the Security Council remains indifferent to the infringement of sovereignty and the massacre of civilians in Arab territories — such as the United States invasion of Iraq and Israel’s aggression in Lebanon — is a typical example of the irresponsibility  unfairness and double standards in its activities. The reform of the Security Council now under consideration should focus on ensuring fairness    06-53609 28  in its activities  first and foremost  and ensure that the non-aligned and developing countries  which make up the overwhelming majority of Member States  are fully represented.   With regard to expansion of the permanent membership of the Council  a country like Japan  the war criminal which invaded Asian countries and massacred innocent people  but which has been distorting its aggressive history instead of liquidating it  should never be allowed to become a permanent member.  The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue to develop relations of friendship and cooperation with all Member States that respect its sovereignty  in accordance with the ideals of its foreign policy — independence  peace and friendship — and will make an active contribution to the efforts of international society to achieve world peace and security and sustainable development. "
"142",5767,"PRT",61,2006,"I would like to begin  like previous speakers  by extending my warmest congratulations to Ms. Haya Rasheed Al-Khalifa  the first woman in nearly 40 years to take up the position of President of the General Assembly. This is good news for international politics. I wish her every success in discharging the mandate on which she is now beginning  in which she can be assured of Portugal’s firm support. We are confident that she will continue the excellent work carried out by her predecessor  Minister Jan Eliasson  whom I am very happy to remember here.  This session of the Assembly is also notable for being the last during which Secretary-General Kofi Annan will be in office. I therefore solemnly express on behalf of the Portuguese people our heartfelt  deep appreciation for the way in which he has carried out his duties over the last 10 years  contributing concretely and decisively to international peace and stability in a world that we all wish were more just. It was on his watch — and with his indispensable personal help — that we saw the birth of the new State of Timor-Leste. Portugal will not forget that this was one of the great recent victories of the United Nations  in peoples’ fight for self-determination  and in defence of the values in the Charter.  This Organization has carried out a crucial task in Timor-Leste  in maintaining peace  consolidating the rule of law and  together with donor countries  creating the foundations for a more prosperous economic and social future for the Timorese people.  There is still a long way to go  it is true. But it is important that the Timorese people be aware that they can count on the United Nations. Unfortunately  the    06-52988 24  recent internal crisis raised a serious question about security  and it is vital that this be resolved if the country is to find stability.  We therefore applaud the new United Nations peace mission  the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste  which represents a continuity of the significant investment made by the international community  to which Portugal belongs. We participate actively in this Mission  consistent with our ongoing commitment  going back over three decades  to the political process of the new State of Timor-Leste.  In this regard  I would also like to pay due tribute to the memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello  brutally murdered three years ago in Baghdad in the service of the United Nations. We will not forget all that he did for the just cause of the Timorese people  and in defence of the values that the United Nations embodies.  This last decade has been one of great changes. The United Nations has had undoubted successes  but there have also been missed opportunities. Many accuse the Organization of undue complexity  slowness in its decision-making process and excessive bureaucracy. It is true that diplomacy requires time  but it does produce results. If there is something that we have learned over these last years  it is that there is no alternative to multilateralism; multilateralism is where the United Nations plays a determinant role.  The United Nations is today one of the greatest guarantors of our collective security. It is our duty to preserve and strengthen it. It is an investment from which we all stand to benefit. Each one of us is a Member of this Organization not only to serve and promote our own national interests  but also — and I would go so far as to say above all — to fulfil the hopes and dreams of the people of the whole world.  The world today  as we know  is full of risks and threats that no country can face alone. If we do not unite in our efforts  we are halfway down the road to failure. Reality  particularly in recent years  has proved this to us quite clearly.  I would therefore like to underline Portugal’s commitment to multilateralism  because we firmly believe that this is the path where one can best uphold the essential values of peace and development.  A big part of this multilateral action rests on a dialogue between cultures and civilizations. It is through this dialogue that we assume a collective responsibility to overcome obstacles  prejudices  preconceived ideas and  principally  ignorance. Our challenge here in this dialogue is not to limit ourselves to mere declarations  but to take firm and concrete steps towards greater interaction between peoples and cultures.  Despite the huge uncertainties and misunderstandings in the world today  we have a set of principles — contained in our Charter — that can inspire us and guide us. They are our best help.  The dialogue between cultures and civilizations also imposes demanding domestic political agendas  in the respect for differences and the inclusion of all citizens in society — the inclusion of immigrants; the inclusion of all  irrespective of their beliefs or religions.  On the other hand  the dialogue between civilizations also imposes steps forward on the international scene  the strengthening of economic bonds between North and South. The strengthening of world trade mechanisms constitutes an investment in our own security  and is an essential part of that dialogue; hence the importance of overcoming the obstacles of the Doha Round in the context of the current negotiations in the World Trade Organization. We all have to be prepared to give up something so that at the end of the day everyone can win.  One of the biggest political challenges that we face in this dialogue of cultures and civilizations is undoubtedly the Middle East. The region remains one of the main focal points of instability in the world. We all have in our minds the painful images of the most recent crisis in Lebanon  where we witnessed the suffering of civilians on both sides of the conflict. This reinforces all the more the need to actively pursue a permanent and balanced solution  which may bring about a dynamic of hope and peace in the region.  The Middle East is not a military issue. The Middle East is  above all  one of the greatest political and diplomatic challenges that today’s world faces. We should not  therefore  miss the window of opportunity offered to us by Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). It is a challenge where the United Nations and the European Union assume shared responsibilities in promoting peace and stability  through an effective multilateral dialogue.   25 06-52988   Portugal fulfils its duty and supports the urgent implementation of this resolution  and we are present in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to help implement it.  I would like to draw attention  once more  to Africa. Portugal has given it great attention  and invested great efforts there  and it is our duty to ensure that the continent is not forgotten. There is progress in Africa that we should encourage  and we also have a historical responsibility on which the developed world should not and cannot turn its back.  I am pleased to stress here today the determination with which the European Union has been reinforcing its partnership and its strategy with the African continent. The current drafting of a Euro-African joint strategy will lead to a script for our relations with Africa in the fundamental areas of peace and security  good governance and human rights  regional trade and integration  and also aspects relating to human development.  I stress the word “joint”. All of us share the responsibility — Africans and Europeans alike. I trust that the conditions will soon be right for this strategy to be adopted. And I hope that it will be at the highest level  when we hold in Lisbon the second European Union-Africa summit.  In recent years  with the consolidation of the African Union and various regional organizations and initiatives  very significant progress has been made in many fields on the African continent  and this has been driven by the continent itself and its own institutions. It is our duty to recognize these developments  support them with renewed support and vigour  and develop them further.  I would also like to recall that last July  in Bissau  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries celebrated its tenth anniversary. This organization has been consolidating itself and strengthening its involvement within the United Nations system  where it currently holds observer status  presenting itself as a credible organization in the fostering of international partnerships.  In Bissau  on the tenth anniversary  we pledged our commitment to achieve the Millennium Development Goals  by defining and implementing a general cooperation strategy where the highest priority is given to achieving these Goals. This is our priority in our domestic policy in Portugal; at the top of our priorities are the Millennium Development Goals. We shall implement them with a bilateral and multilateral cooperation strategy that will help to fight poverty  alleviate the pressure on migratory flows and promote sustainable development.  September in New York  above all else  should not be some sort of annual pilgrimage to rediscover this Organization. At the end of the day  the credibility of the United Nations is in our hands.  We all face the same challenges. But  at the same time  they give us the opportunity to live in accordance with our ideals and put into practice the principles that have guided us for more than six decades. The only way out is for us to look for answers together. That is why we need a stronger and more cohesive United Nations. We owe this to ourselves. We owe it to our children. But  above all  we owe it to future generations. "
"143",5813,"PRY",61,2006,"Madam President  may I tell you how happy Paraguay is to see you presiding over the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. Your personal and professional qualities ensure the success of this session.  I wish to reiterate what I said at the earlier summit meeting. For Paraguay  peace and security  development with social justice  democracy and human rights are the fundamental pillars on which the world must be based  because they are interconnected principles that mutually strengthen each other. We cannot consider ourselves to be in an airtight compartment  because if pride of place is given to one over another  this Assembly will not be a pluralistic  representative body. Rather  the single-voiced will of Powers will continue to be imposed on others.  My delegation thanks the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his detailed annual report on the work of the Organization (A/61/1). Ideally  the   41 06-52737  Secretary-General would not travel only to those places where barbaric warfare is destroying cities and killing innocent  defenceless people. Perhaps something would change if he were also to go to see the vast universe of poverty and social exclusion resulting from worldwide  profoundly unjust disorder  and then propose solutions. We urgently need to build a global partnership of solidarity to supplement the efforts made by our countries. Only in this way will we be able to deal with the problems of poverty  hunger and the lack of access to education and health care. Clearly  every country is responsible for achieving its own economic and social development by applying the proper policies to mobilize domestic resources. But those national efforts should be supplemented by explicit commitments by the developed countries to promote and facilitate access to international markets and more balance in economic relations and in the price of products.  The experience of developed countries themselves shows that  without external cooperation  they would have had difficulty in prospering or in restructuring their economies.  The reciprocal increase in production and trade is a driving force for development. However  the trend towards more concentrated productive expansion and insufficient participation in the benefits of world trade condemn the majority of countries to marginalization from development. For this reason  Paraguay calls once again for the right of all nations to more even-handed  equitable treatment  including the right to build a new form of solidarity among States which are capable of promoting progress on a global scale.  Agricultural subsidies  protectionism  the lack of technology transfers and the distortions in international trade  together with ethnocentric control of information  knowledge and science  postpone development and punish countries on the periphery with a pre-modern and wasted life. Because of those recurrent circumstances  we are convinced that the tariffs and non-tariff barriers that are applied not only by developed countries but also by our own regional partners must be removed. Only in that way can we quickly overcome asymmetries and unjust discrimination.  Society expects more of democracy and of politicians. It expects the system that guarantees liberty and equality before the law also to be a system which promotes and ensures the well-being of all and puts an end to exclusion. Unfortunately  this basic conception of politics is not reflected in the behaviour of many actors. In practice  petty interests  selfishness and party faction are considered more important and have greater priority than the interests of the nation. Democracy as government in the service of the common good is being bastardized. That gives rise to the lack of prestige and devaluation of politics and democracy  particularly in Latin America.  This erratic direction that politics is taking must be corrected in countries which do not have a democratic tradition: we have only just built low-quality democracy  a pseudo-democracy laced with conspiracies against good governance and the exercise of power based on legitimacy and the will of the majority of the people.  In any event  in Paraguay  we are making a great effort. School attendance is showing exponential growth. Educational reform  now extended to higher education  has practically universalized basic education. The secondary school population is following the same trend  while university enrolment has doubled through the institutionalization of equal opportunities and conditions. According to the United Nations itself  Paraguay is in a position to achieve  for example  the Millennium Development Goal related to education. One of our key objectives here is to gain certification of zero illiteracy for our country by 2008.  Together with improving and significantly expanding public and private health-care services  our environmental policy is recovering the great ecological sustainability which characterized Paraguay. This is taking place in the midst of silent agrarian reform. In addition to the massive purchase of land for orphan peasants — which is still insufficient to alleviate the unfair distribution of land in Paraguay — we are implementing a policy aimed at rural settlement and increased production and productivity as a way of giving fresh significance to peasant life  its sustainability and its dignity.  Positive action is also taking place with a view to modernizing the State through simplification  transparency and making its services effective. We are seeking to improve public safety  combat corruption and eradicate piracy  drug trafficking and smuggling. If one looks at the crime index  Paraguay has one of the lowest rates. Nevertheless  we are obliged to improve legal security  and to do that we must implement a    06-52737 42  policy of professional qualification and establish ethics in the judicial system.  Development financing continues to be limited in terms of fulfilling national development plans and programmes  both those which are the result of international mobilization and those which result from the domestic mobilization of financial resources. This situation reflects the viability of various projects which are directed towards expanding productive employment  improving basic social services  education and adapting productive infrastructure and other areas of action which are essential for development.  We are aware that the main task begins within our countries. It is we who bear the main responsibility. However  with the increase in domestic savings  good macroeconomic policies and a predictable country  we in Paraguay are reducing poverty and are moving towards development. Therefore  our country continues to focus on rationalizing public expenditure and on social and productive investment. This fiscal discipline makes us worthy of increased support from international financial institutions. But what we need in Latin America  as the President of our sister Republic of Bolivia said earlier today  are markets and partners  not bosses or others who would continue to seize the wealth and natural resources of the peoples of our region.  On the subject of human rights  we welcome the fact that  through a process of focused consultations  the General Assembly  in March  adopted resolution 60/251  which established the Human Rights Council. That Council will have a mechanism for the periodic and universal review of States’ compliance with their obligations in this important area  a review based on dialogue and cooperation. What we want is that the criteria for assessing human rights be applied in the same way and using the same principles both to developing countries and to developed countries. The assessment of human rights would thus not affect only developing countries and countries with emerging economies  which are making great efforts at institution-building and at consolidating democracy and freedom.  The fight against terrorism should unite people who love liberty and seek respect for human rights and the rule of law. While it is true that fundamentalism of all kinds is anachronistic and dangerous  terrorism should not be the only item on the international agenda  excluding or relegating to the back burner the equally crucial debate on poverty and development in countries with peripheral capitalism and those with emerging economies. Civilization means respect for diversity and differences. Combating terrorism thus requires that any repressive action be carried out within the jurisdiction of international law and not through mere administrative procedures.  With regard to the question of the representation in the United Nations of the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan  Paraguay  consistent with the position it has long held  confirms its support in favour of their admission to the United Nations. Their inclusion is consistent with the principle of universality embodied in our Charter  as well as with the norms of international law.  To address the problems and conflicts now facing the international community  it is necessary to create a multipolar world and to make it function. The equilibrium of our twenty-first-century universe replete with uncertainty  depends on multipolarity. For that reason  my country and the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) place their hopes on that approach  and in particular on the reform of the Security Council. It is shameful that what occurs in the Council should be seen as more important than the United Nations as an Organization which promotes a culture of peace  global development and the universalization of science and technology.  In Latin America  as was said by my friend the President of our sister Republic of Bolivia  we have a culture of peace and brotherhood. We seek harmony with our fellow human beings and with nature. Unfortunately  at other times in our history  we have experienced warfare — not because our peoples wanted it  but because of manipulation by imperialists thirsting to destroy our wealth and fragment our peoples. We have put that history behind us. Today we look to the future to see how we in our region can pool our efforts to deal with poverty and recover our peoples’ political  economic and cultural sovereignty.  In addition  the hierarchy and institutional structure of the United Nations depend on a world where equilibrium prevails  ensuring fairness in decisions and action. We do not need sermons about education for peace and the megamillions spent on the arms build-up. We are not naïve and were offended to   43 06-52737  see that in 2004 alone  the super-Powers spent sums of money on rearming that could have put an end to poverty and ignorance in the world.  Certainly military belligerence  which is so destructive and so threatening  is not unrelated to the scandalous rise in the price of oil today  which is causing insecurity  economic slowdown and stagnation in the developing countries. Inequality for our peoples should not mean that we must take bread out of the mouths of the poor in order to waste millions of dollars on fratricidal weapons.  Over and above the events that threaten world peace are the daily lives of people. In our region  life is good only for the minority and miserable for the majority.  Therefore  we urgently need a United Nations that makes a contribution to the development  well-being and freedom of all peoples. Likewise  it is our duty to build an entirely prosperous  fair and united society so that the countenances of our citizens reflect their happy lives. May God illuminate our path  so that there can be brotherhood among all nations and individuals  and so that our history can truly embark on the path of peace. "
"144",5832,"PSE",61,2006,"I would like to start by congratulating Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to preside over this session and to wish her success in achieving the objectives of the United Nations  which are accepted by all nations of the world  which believe that the Organization was created to safeguard international peace  human rights  and the right of peoples to self-determination. Indeed  as President Woodrow Wilson said in his first inaugural address:  “Nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong  alleviate suffering  and set the weak in the way of strength and hope.”  I hope  therefore  that this session will promote cooperation between nations and peoples in pursuit of their common interests  namely the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations  which form the basis for membership in this Organization.  We must commend highly the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the effective role he has played and the considerable efforts he has deployed  as well as for his wise leadership in enhancing the United Nations and reinvigorating its role. We also commend him in particular for his efforts in respect of the Arab-Israeli conflict  the core of which is the question of Palestine.  Only a few weeks ago  the fires of war stopped raging in Lebanon. Despite the gravity of the losses  the destruction and the tragedy  the international community expeditiously  effectively and successfully intervened to put an end to the war and to provide support to the people and the legitimate Government of Lebanon in order to safeguard its security and independence and to put an end to the era of wars on its land. I commend the role played by the international community  and I hope that that positive and effective intervention will be extended  politically and practically  so as to resolve the root causes of all the conflicts and wars that have plagued our region for many decades.  Indeed  I need not reconfirm the fact that  after the experiences of war and suffering that we have been through  unless the question of Palestine and that of the continuing occupation of Palestinian and Arab lands since 1967 is resolved  the elements of tension and conflagration will keep the conflict alive and leave the door wide open to all forms of violence  terrorism  regional confrontations and global crises.  It is unfortunate today to see that international plans and initiatives  foremost among them the road map  which was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council  have reached a state of stagnation  even regression. Calls for the resumption of negotiations are faced with preconditions. Despair and frustration thrive in the midst of the roar of the bulldozers that are preparing for the construction of illegal settlements  changes in the demographic nature of Jerusalem and erection of an apartheid separation wall inside our occupied land and between its various parts. They thrive on the continuation of the frightful siege  through military checkpoints that have turned our cities and provinces into reservations  on the continuous saga of killings and assassinations that have claimed hundreds of civilian lives  on the demolitions of homes and on the ongoing arrests of more than    06-53005 52  8 000 Palestinians  including parliamentarians and cabinet ministers. Some of the detained have been languishing for three decades  and their release and freedom are still eagerly awaited by their families and their people.  Under such conditions  I can reasonably ask: how can the international community expect extremism to retreat or the waves of violence to ebb? How can we and all the forces of moderation and peace in our region forcefully intervene and convince our public opinion that there is hope on the horizon? Or that the option of dialogue  negotiation and international legitimacy — which is our strategic choice and the path which we relentlessly advocate and which we will never abandon — will be fruitful and has a real chance of success?  Living in the midst of this tragedy  I am not the only one who must answer this fundamental question. The whole international community  particularly influential Powers  is called upon to provide tangible evidence that it will support an unconditional resumption of negotiations and provide those negotiations with true international support to ensure their success through the cessation of settlement activity  collective punishment and separation walls. This would provide a positive atmosphere for relaunching the negotiations and reaching the objectives of a just peace based on a two-State solution  as called for by President George Bush of the United States of America. Such a solution must be based on international legitimacy  as stressed in the Arab Peace Initiative  through the establishment of the independent State of Palestine on the 4 June 1967 borders  with East Jerusalem as its capital  and in reaching a just and agreed solution for the problem of the refugees — who constitute more than half of our Palestinian people — in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948.  Lately  we have heard from the Government of Israel that it will abandon its policy of unilateralism and one-sided actions. This is encouraging  provided that the alternative is not stagnation or the imposition of faits accomplis on the ground  but rather a return to the negotiating table and to reaching a comprehensive solution to all of the permanent status issues in order to ensure a secure future for our children and theirs.  Recently  in tandem with all the strands and persuasions of the Palestinian political spectrum  I have sought to establish a Government of national unity that is consistent with international and Arab legitimacy and that corresponds to the principles established by the Quartet. Based on our commitment to these criteria  I would like to reaffirm that any future Palestinian Government will commit to and abide by all the agreements that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian National Authority have committed to in the past  particularly the letters of mutual recognition dated 9 September 1993 exchanged between the two late  great leaders  Yasser Arafat and Itzhak Rabin. These two letters contain the mutual recognition by Israel and the PLO  the renunciation of violence and the adoption of negotiations as the path towards reaching a permanent solution leading to the establishment of the independent State of Palestine alongside the State of Israel.  Any future Government will commit to imposing security and order  to ending the phenomenon of multiple militias  lack of discipline or chaos  and will commit to the rule of law  since this is primarily a national Palestinian need. The efforts that we have exerted are for the sole purpose of establishing national unity that has real substance in order to achieve national Palestinian consensus around our national objectives  which comply with international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative and call for peaceful means for the realization of these objectives. When such a national consensus is reached and a new national unity Government has been established according to it  it must be viewed as a qualitative achievement —  not a step backwards or a limited regression from the path to which we have always been determinedly committed — even in the face of the bleakest of conditions.  I would like to reiterate that negotiations with Israel have been and will remain under the jurisdiction and responsibility of the Palestine Liberation Organization  which I chair. The outcome of these negotiations will be presented to the Palestinian National Council  the highest Palestinian national body  or to a national public referendum.  What we have achieved in this regard should suffice to lift the unjust siege imposed on our people. That siege has inflicted extensive damage on our   53 06-53005  society  our livelihood and the means to our growth and progress.  Madam President  I come to you bearing the wounds of a people who are bleeding on a daily basis. We are a people who seeks normal life  where our children can go safely to school  where children are born to live  not die; where youth can find honourable and decent work that provides them with a dignified path to a secure future so that they can be partners in formulating their history  rather than be victims to the cruelty of history; where women give birth in hospitals  not at the checkpoints of the occupation; where families gather in the evening to dream of a new day  a day without killing  imprisonment or arrest.  I simply want tomorrow to be better than today. I want my homeland  Palestine  to be a homeland  rather than a prison — independent and sovereign  like homelands of all other peoples of this world. I want Jerusalem to be the point of convergence for the dialogue of all prophets and the capital of two States living side by side in peace and equality.  Thirty-two years ago  from this rostrum  the late President Yasser Arafat issued his famous and resounding call: “Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand” (A/PV.2282  para. 82). I now reiterate that call. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand. I repeat: do not let the olive branch fall from my hand. "
"145",5878,"QAT",61,2006,"It gives me pleasure at the outset to congratulate you  Madam President  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I wish you every success in your endeavours. I should also like to thank your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his efforts during the Assembly’s sixtieth session. Our thanks also go to Mr. Kofi Annan  who has been working to strengthen the role of the United Nations.  During the September 2005 Summit  the international community reaffirmed its commitment to the global partnership for development in order to achieve internationally agreed development objectives. The United Nations system remains one of the most important pillars of international support for that partnership. I wish to recall here that the State of Qatar has always been a supportive partner in development efforts  particularly in combating poverty  because all that has positive results for stability and international peace and security.  In 2001 Qatar hosted the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization  which culminated in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. It also hosted the South Summit in 2005  in which His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani  Emir of the State of Qatar  launched his initiative to establish the South’s Fund for Development and Humanitarian Assistance. Moreover  His Highness reaffirmed Qatar’s commitment to meet the internationally agreed official development assistance target relative to its gross national product. His Highness also offered to host the first Review Conference of the International Conference on Financing for Development. I am pleased to note that the State of Qatar will be hosting the Sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies  scheduled for 30 October to 1 November this year.   I should also like to recall here that Qatar has extended emergency and disaster relief assistance and made many contributions to the various United Nations funds and programmes.  We must work to strengthen the role of the United Nations and revitalize and support its institutions so that they can carry out the tasks entrusted to them in different parts of the world. However  if the Organization is to discharge its role in full  its Charter must be adhered to and respected. Furthermore  an agreement must be reached on a new formula to reform the Security Council and update its working methods. The General Assembly must be allowed to play its role in the maintenance of international peace and security alongside the Security Council.   We were shocked and astonished at the disproportionate Israeli response against fraternal Lebanon  which killed hundreds of innocent civilians  totally decimated its infrastructure and left scores of Lebanese towns and villages in ruins. It has also displaced one quarter of Lebanon’s population  which is indeed a full-scale war crime.  The Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian question must be accorded top priority  for which a comprehensive  permanent and just solution is urgently needed. The Palestinian question is an example of suffering visited upon a people whose legitimate rights were denied  a question that has been on the agendas of   27 06-52879  the Security Council and the General Assembly for more than 50 years. Therefore the international community must review its position towards a fundamental issue that it has left unresolved for more than half a century  thus compounding the tragedy of the Palestinian people.   Compelling Israel to implement United Nations resolutions is a collective duty that we must all fulfil so that international legitimacy will not be branded as selective. The Palestinian people must be enabled to exercise their right to self-determination and to establish their independent State with Jerusalem as its capital.   A comprehensive  peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict should also be achieved  on the basis of Israel’s withdrawal from all the territories it occupied in 1967  including the Syrian Golan and the Lebanese Sheba’a farms. We also stress that the guarantee of permanent peace  security and stability in the region lies in making the Middle East a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction without any exceptions.  The difficult situation in fraternal Iraq requires our cooperation in order to help it overcome this untenable situation and its repercussions. We have continuously reaffirmed our commitment to the unity and sovereignty of Iraq  to the rights of Iraqis to live in dignity and freedom and to rebuild their country  and for Iraq to regain its well-deserved place in the region and among the family of nations.  We want to pay tribute to the Government of the Sudan  which after tireless efforts has succeeded in establishing peace in the south of the country. It continues its sincere efforts to achieve security and stability in different parts of the country. We fully support those efforts and look forward to more support from the international community to fraternal Sudan in order to preserve its unity and territorial integrity.   We also support ongoing efforts by the League of Arab States to achieve national reconciliation in fraternal Somalia and to restore the rule of law in that country. We call upon the international community to support those efforts so that stability and security can be restored to Somalia.  We reaffirm the important role of the United Nations and the need to enhance it so that it can put international relations on a solid foundation of understanding and common interests. We also stress the importance of resolving conflicts and disputes by peaceful means and of cooperation among all nations to end violence and combat terrorism. We must avoid squandering our resources and wasting our energies on wars and conflicts. Instead  we should channel them towards development and progress. We look forward to a new world governed by the principles of justice  equality  freedom  democracy and peaceful coexistence among its peoples  nations and civilizations. "
"146",5924,"ROU",61,2006,"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly. The Romanian delegation looks forward to a presidency which brings to the world Organization excellent diplomatic skills  while increasing our confidence in the prospects for more balanced gender representation at the top. I would also like to pay tribute to Ambassador Jan Eliasson  President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  for his outstanding performance and for his commitment to the reform of the United Nations.  Romania subscribes to the statement made by the President of Finland on behalf of the European Union  and fully shares the views expressed therein. I would like  in addition  to give a frank account of my country’s keen and active interest in a strong and effective United Nations.  Let me say  in all modesty  that we strive hard to practice what we preach. Romania has had to make up for 16 years of lost time — decades of ideological pandemics  economic mismanagement  lack of respect for human rights and lack of democracy. I would like to express the gratitude of my Government for the continuing support that the United Nations has extended during our transition in many helpful ways  including the valuable work of its country team in Romania.  We have come a long way to now be in a position to join the European Union  which is profoundly rooted in the principles of liberty  democracy  respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms  and the rule of law. We have worked hard  that is true  and we have had very good friends all along to help us prevail. I am therefore proud to say that the United Nations has been  and still is  foremost among those friends.  Let me quote a recent statement by the Secretary-General:  “Our success in advancing the agenda will depend on great part on forging coalitions for change involving Government representative  civil society  the private sector  philanthropic foundations  academic institutions and all others with contributions to make. I know that Romania is strongly committed to this path of partnership and has been working actively to cement constructive ties with the United Nations and with its neighbours throughout Europe as the country moves towards formal accession to the European Union.”  I myself could not have put it better if I had wished to characterize in a nutshell our genuine commitment to effective multilateralism and to better management of the rapid and multifaceted changes brought about by the globalization process. That is why Romania understands  and wishes to be an active participant in  the current reform process  pursuant to the guidelines we accepted as set out in the Millennium Summit Outcome.  We have made significant steps ahead as far as institutional reform is concerned. We agreed to change the Human Rights Commission  a body whose historical mission had been accomplished. We created a new Human Rights Council to help the United Nations make a fresh start in the implementation of the impressive corpus of international human rights instruments built since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But let us not indulge in complacency. If we do not fill this new box with the expected contents  our intention to reform will remain unfulfilled.  The Human Rights Council should spare no effort in order to do what it is meant to do: uphold  in the daily work of Governments across all continents and legal systems  the priority goal of ensuring that human rights are widely and deeply known and observed. We should not see the primary duty of the international community to monitor the implementation of human rights law  be it by a universal peer review or by the expert work of the special procedures of the Human Rights Council  as unfriendly gestures towards our Governments.   We are deeply honoured by the exceptional opportunity we have as members of the first Human Rights Council to contribute to the reform of the United Nations human rights machinery. We have already come up with a number of proposals aimed at streamlining the work of the new Council and at upholding its authority. We need to make greater efforts to make human rights a fundamental pillar of the United Nations  on an equal footing with security and development  by will of its Charter.    06-53323 36   There is a similar need with respect to the Peacebuilding Commission. The history of the United Nations involves the continuing trend of creating new bodies to address new problems. That can be a virtue if such bodies have a strong mandate and sufficient resources to meet expectations. But it can also be a sin if all we do is generate additional meetings and documents without consequence. The Peacebuilding Commission is a remarkable institutional and legal innovation. Let us introduce new thinking and resources  rather than old habits  into this framework.   Considerable efforts have been deployed since 1993 to reform the Security Council. Romania is ready to embark on a meaningful and pragmatic consideration of the question of increasing the membership of the Security Council while preserving its effectiveness and credibility. We are aware of the difficulties inherent in further Council expansion. Recent debates have shown that all Member States should benefit to a certain extent from the reform of the most powerful body in the United Nations system. An obvious case in point is the Eastern European Group  which expects to receive its fair share in the eventual outcome of negotiations on this matter.  The issue of the revitalization of the General Assembly is also on our agenda. The intensive efforts made to expand the Security Council should not obscure the need to genuinely reform the most representative organ of the United Nations — namely the General Assembly. There are many ways to do much more within existing structures and available resources in terms of time and money. We can make simple reforms. We may choose to streamline the agenda by confining it to essential and topical issues  avoiding the annual repetition of texts which bring no true added value  and using less rhetoric and more pragmatism as the main thread of our decisions.   The General Assembly can also do more in its role of supporting democratization processes in various countries. We know how shy the drafters of the Charter were about the use of the idea of democracy. During the cold war  the concept of democracy was merely totemic at the United Nations. However  times have changed for the better. I genuinely believe that the United Nations has made considerable  if not truly spectacular  progress in that area.  My country is proud to have been an active player in two international movements whose fundamental task is to promote democracy: the New or Restored Democracies process and the Community of Democracies. We have taken dedicated action under the auspices of both. Romania initiated a series of five resolutions on different aspects of democracy-building that have been adopted since the year 2000 by both the Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly.   There is no reason why the United Nations would slow down this process. On the contrary  we take this opportunity to encourage both the sixth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies  to be held in Qatar  and the third Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies  to be held in Mali  to dare to do more. The time has come for us to adopt a universal declaration on democracy  a code of democratic conduct or even an international covenant on the right to democracy. Democracy works  despite difficulties and temporary setbacks.   Let me add that  if we have doubts about our duty  we should ask our nations if they want to have a choice  in a multiparty system  and to make full use of fair elections  as opposed to not participating or having to accede violently to power? Do they want to be governed by dictators who work for themselves or by Governments that work for the governed? We all may find the answer to these queries quite obvious.  In our deliberations about reform  one of the questions that arose was how to undertake constitutional reform and bring the Charter more in line with the new challenges of our time. There is much to be done here  in spite of our understandable reluctance to reopen the sacred book. At the same time  we could adequately make the most out of the existing legal framework.  We believe that Chapter VIII of the Charter is a generous framework for increased and more efficient cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. During its tenure as a non-permanent member of the Security Council  my country  Romania  initiated a rewarding debate on this topic  which led to the adoption of resolution 1631 (2005). We welcome the report of the Secretary-General entitled “A regional-global security partnership: challenges and opportunities”. The report is a very valuable contribution to the clarification of the possible distribution of roles based on the competitive advantages of regional organizations. I therefore   37 06-53323  support the recommendations made by the Secretary-General aimed at passing from an “adhocracy” to the gradual institutionalization of the operational mechanisms of an enhanced cooperation.  In this field  Romania practices what it preaches. The proof lies in its determination to pursue regional cooperation processes in Central and South-Eastern Europe  in various fields: the South-Eastern European Cooperation Process  the Central European Initiative  the Stability Pact for South-eastern Europe  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and so on. The stability and prosperity in the Black Sea region is the main priority of our foreign policy at the regional level. We are pursuing a new cooperation paradigm that is expected to produce deliverable results. Romania is satisfied at having promoted  during its chairmanship of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation  two very important initiatives: a Black Sea Euro-region  under the auspices of the Council of Europe  and a Forum for Dialogue and Partnership.  We are a conscientious and responsible member of the international community and ready to assume our duties. The constant and robust economic growth of recent years has now enabled my country to consider acting as a donor  helping developing countries in their long-standing pursuit of economic prosperity. My Government has already taken measures to define a legal framework for the financing of official development assistance.   Europe has peace on its borders. But that is only half true if we take into consideration the continued existence of frozen conflicts that seem to escape the active attention of the United Nations. We are shirking our duty if we turn a deaf ear to the unresolved conflicts whose roots date back to the Soviet era. Those conflicts affect small States that are working hard to consolidate their independence  their institutions and their economies. They need the assistance of the United Nations and protection under international law.  One of the most striking examples is the situation in Transdniestria  a separatist area of our neighbouring country the Republic of Moldova. The lawless regime there must not be allowed to become permanent. Supported by heavily armed troops  that regime is involved in smuggling and illegal trafficking and is disrespectful of human rights; it is also ready to seize schools manu militari. Relying on its weapons and ammunition  the regime threatens its neighbours and the legitimate Government of the Republic of Moldova and cynically mocks democracy through unlawful referendums.   The United Nations must apply the provisions of the Charter to put an end to the dark ages in Transdniestria. What is needed is genuine will on the part of all relevant actors — be they international organizations or neighbouring countries. We also believe that it is our duty to assist the courageous efforts of Georgia to build a democratic society and to regain full territorial integrity. There is hope. The recent adoption by the General Assembly of a decision to include on its agenda a new item on protracted conflicts — which Romania has fully supported — augurs well for a new attitude.  Seven years after the United Nations took responsibility for the future of Kosovo  that province symbolizes the difficult legacy that the Western Balkans is struggling to overcome. We support the efforts of Martti Ahtisaari  Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo  and of the Contact Group. Both sides directly concerned should show greater flexibility in order to find a lasting and mutually accepted solution. In that regard  the United Nations role remains extremely important until the future status of the province is decided.  Our interest in achieving peace  stability and prosperity is not confined to our own region. Romania is trying hard to make significant contributions to the maintenance of peace throughout the world. Romanian military  police and civilian personnel are present in the United Nations peacekeeping operations deployed in Afghanistan  Kosovo  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Liberia  Ethiopia and Eritrea  Haiti and the Sudan. Together with other peace-loving nations  we also contribute troops to other major peace operations  including those in Afghanistan  Iraq and Bosnia. Nearly 1 500 Romanian troops  civilian police  military observers  staff officers and support personnel are deployed in those areas.   At the same time  we believe that more efforts are needed to find lasting political solutions to existing conflicts and tensions. Afghanistan has come a long way towards becoming a stable State  free from terrorism and the Taliban. However  many challenges still lie ahead. Winning the peace in Afghanistan requires even more enhanced and coordinated efforts    06-53323 38  by the international community — especially to fight insurgents  to train the Afghan army and police and to accelerate quick-impact reconstruction projects.  Romania firmly supports the Government of Iraq in its efforts to create an efficient and responsible administration. Strong international support is needed if the Iraqi people are to succeed in achieving lasting stability and in going back to work for the country’s prosperity. Technical and financial support is also badly needed. It is essential not to weaken the international presence in Iraq  without which the progress made thus far would be put at risk.  We take note with satisfaction of the latest developments in Lebanon  particularly the progress made in deploying an expanded United Nations force in the area. We believe that we are witnessing a historic breakthrough in a long-standing conflict. We are confident that the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and of the future mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon will build hope and trust for a lasting political solution to the Middle East conflict.   The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has emerged as a major threat to global security and international stability. We should never underestimate the chances that such weapons will be used in terrorist activities. We support new international efforts to strengthen the existing international regimes  to ensure the full and unconditional implementation of obligations undertaken by the States parties and to promote the universalization of multilateral treaties and agreements in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation.  At the same time  we must continue to fight terrorism  individually and collectively  in order to eliminate it as a threat to the lives of innocent people and to the daily life of our societies. If it is to succeed  the international community must correctly identify and overcome the factors that contribute to terrorism. Romania is firmly engaged in the fight against terrorist threats through its participation in the efforts of the international community and in those undertaken by regional and subregional organizations. (spoke in French)  Romania will soon have the honour to host the eleventh summit of la Francophonie. This conference of heads of State and Government of countries using French as a common language will take place on 28 and 29 September 2006 in Bucharest. La Francophonie definitely does more than promote multilingualism. At the previous summit  la Francophonie acted as a faithful partner by adopting a strategic framework aligned with the Millennium Goals and the objectives of the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development  held at Johannesburg. That framework is fully in keeping with the fight against poverty and the efforts to promote sustainable development. It is based on a consensus that emphasizes human rights  good governance and democracy  as well as conflict prevention and peacebuilding. This year  the summit will have the theme “Information technologies in education”. That is another complementary area on which la Francophonie intends to focus in order to contribute to the objectives agreed at the World Summit on the Information Society. I hope that during the present session of the General Assembly  Romania will be able to report further actions taken by la Francophonie in keeping with United Nations objectives. "
"147",5970,"RUS",61,2006,"Traditionally  the General Assembly session provides an opportunity to conduct a review of the current situation in the world  identify major international issues and determine the role that the United Nations could play in resolving them.   I believe that we have every reason to conclude that there is a prevailing trend of growing awareness of the need to strengthen the collective foundations of international politics  as well as of the fact that there is no alternative to tackling problems through multilateral diplomacy. That trend is based on objective facts  for it reflects the realities of an emerging multipolar architecture of international relations. It is logical  because answers to global challenges and threats can only be found collectively. Finally  it is a manifestation of historical continuity  because we are revisiting the same objective as the founding fathers of the United Nations were determined to pursue by enshrining in the Charter the principles for a system of collective security.   It is precisely such an approach  firmly grounded in international law  that can ensure the world’s sustainable development in this era of globalization. That requires a strengthened central role for the universal Organization in every area of international life.  We must of course continue to adapt the mechanisms and methods of the United Nations to the new environment. Much has been done as follow-up to the decisions of the 2005 World Summit: The Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council have been established  and the reform process has been extended to management.   It is important that all our further work be based upon the fundamental principle of the universality of the United Nations. Patterns contrary to the Charter of the United Nations that exclude individual States or groups of States from participating meaningfully in the activities of the Organization or that introduce a single system of values into the work of the Secretariat are unsustainable. Let us not forget that the United Nations belongs to us all. Moreover  administrative reform should not lead to the bureaucracy taking over the management of the Organization  thereby jeopardizing the intergovernmental nature of the United Nations.  A trend towards collective action has also spread beyond the structures of the United Nations. During Russia’s presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8)  there was greater interaction between the G-8 and other leading countries and international organizations. Over    06-53005 28  the past 12 months our dialogue partners have actively contributed to Saint Petersburg summit documents on every main agenda item  including global energy security  education and controlling infectious diseases.   A new and genuinely collaborative type of interaction between the G-8 and Africa is now emerging in this era of globalization  as the needs of the continent are reflected in the mainstream of world development rather than being viewed as issues divorced from overall trends.   The G-8 does not have a monopoly over the decisions taken at Saint Petersburg. All States are invited to participate in their implementation.  Regional organizations and cooperation and coordination between those organizations and the United Nations have also strengthened in maintaining international peace and security. Issues pertaining to that were discussed yesterday at the special ministerial meeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.5529). Once again  we are dealing here with an important dimension of collective action by the international community.  The Commonwealth of Independent States has made a significant contribution to such interaction. To address common problems  specific actions have been taken within the Commonwealth area  primarily within the Eurasian Economic Community and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Further substantive and resolute efforts are being made in the context of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization  which developed and launched and initiative to establish a partnership network for multilateral organizations in the Asia-Pacific region. Development patterns in that region will largely determine the future contours of our planet.   Multilateral institutions in Latin America have also become stronger  and the development of the African Union is gaining momentum.  At their recent Summit in Havana  heads of State of the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement expressed their support for a collective search — within the context of the central role of the United Nations — for agreed solutions to problems confronting the world community.  Europe  of course  is not outside the common trend towards collective examination and resolution of common problems. In that connection  we also see growing awareness of the fact that security and prosperity are indivisible. We expect NATO to transform itself from a defence alliance into something more contemporary that would be in line with principles of transparency and collective response and based upon a universal legal foundation.   We have been watching with keen interest the emerging foreign policy and security mechanisms of the European Union. Russia is prepared to cooperate with multilateral structures in the Euro-Atlantic space and other regions of the world. In fact  we already have effective common mechanisms with many of them.  Collective efforts are also needed to further develop international law  primarily within the context of countering new threats. The United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  which was recently adopted by consensus  is an important contribution in terms of strengthening the legal basis for the anti-terrorist coalition and ensuring a comprehensive approach to counter-terrorism. It is not only about countering all terrorist manifestations and ideologies  it is also about eliminating the problems that give rise to terrorism. The next step will be to agree upon a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.  It is necessary to secure the achievements that have been made by taking practical steps. In the course of Russia’s presidency of the G-8  the Second Ministerial Conference on Drug Trafficking Routes From Afghanistan was held  where additional measures were approved aimed at mobilizing the international community to counter the terrorism-related drug threat originating from Afghanistan. Another international meeting will be held in Moscow next November to focus on developing modalities for government-business partnerships in countering terrorism.  What is needed today are more proactive measures to prevent lethal weapons from falling into the hands of non-State actors  as well as the consistent implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and other counter-terrorism resolutions of the Council. The Russia-United States global initiative to combat nuclear terrorism  which was launched at Saint Petersburg by Presidents Vladimir V. Putin and George W. Bush last July  should be an important tool in preventing a linkage between weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. That initiative invites interested States to act collectively.  The ever-growing demand for the unique peacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations also calls for a collective effort. Not all of those capabilities   29 06-53005  have been utilized to the fullest. Utilizing the capabilities of the Military Staff Committee  as well as those of regional organizations  on the basis of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter would be helpful.  It is encouraging to see a more active role being played by Africans themselves in peacemaking operations in Africa — an undertaking spearheaded by the African Union and supported by the United Nations.   In a number of crisis situations conditions are gradually emerging for a transition to post-conflict reconstruction. It is our hope that the Declaration on Cooperation and Future Action in Stabilization and Reconstruction adopted at the Saint Petersburg G-8 Summit will help us complement the efforts of the United Nations and regional organizations at this critically important period of transition to peacebuilding.  A comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict remains a central task for the world community. Many of today’s threats have come together in that region  and the key to resolving them is most often to be found there. In that connection  I should first like to mention the truly global challenge posed by the need to prevent a schism between civilizations.   We welcome the emerging prospects for a national agreement in the Palestinian territories  as well as for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks. It is important to continue to encourage the parties to meet their respective obligations  with the clear understanding that any progress towards the objectives set out by the international community will inevitably be gradual and that any attempt to act in an all-or-nothing spirit will be counterproductive and could once again plunge the region into confrontation.  The recent war in Lebanon demonstrated the great fragility of the situation in the Middle East and the acute need for a comprehensive approach along all tracks. That presupposes the involvement of all countries and parties. Without their participation it will be impossible to reach any viable negotiated solution. It is also clear that the road to comprehensive peace will not be an easy one  but now is the time. The initiative of the League of Arab States to convene an international conference should contribute to finding the proper framework for that undertaking. The Quartet of international mediators should also make a key contribution to the process.  A breakthrough on a Middle East settlement could provide the positive momentum so wanting in the region. It could also facilitate the solution of other burning problems in the region and in neighbouring countries. That is particularly true as regards efforts aimed at stabilizing the situation in Iraq  where attempts to contain wanton violence and chaos have thus far proved unsuccessful. Dozens of people  mainly civilians  continue to die in Iraq every day. Five officials of the Russian embassy in Baghdad have also fallen victim to that barbarous massacre. A resolution in Iraq will be possible only through concerted efforts. That requires the involvement in the political process of all major Iraqi interests and the implementation of the plans of that country’s Government to reach genuine national accord  with the concerted support of the international community  including all of Iraq’s neighbours.  We are  unfortunately  now witnessing growing significance of the use of force in world affairs; that undermines non-proliferation regimes. The feeling of a lack of predictability and stability in the area of security is becoming ever more pronounced. Against that background  the growing interest of many States in nuclear energy may give rise to concerns  given the trend towards the global proliferation of sensitive technologies.   Apart from current resolute steps to find negotiated solutions to individual problems — such as the Iranian nuclear programme and the problem of the Korean peninsula — there is a need for an urgent effort by the entire international community to systematically strengthen non-proliferation regimes on a generally acceptable basis  while ensuring that the benefits of peaceful atomic energy are legitimately accessible to all States.   President Vladimir V. Putin’s initiative to establish multilateral centres for nuclear fuel-cycle services  along with similar ideas proposed by the leadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and proposals put forth by United States President George W. Bush  have found support among G-8 leaders. We are confident that the development and practical implementation of such approaches — in cooperation with all countries with an interest in modern and safe nuclear energy — will make it    06-53005 30  possible to resolve non-proliferation issues in a non-confrontational manner.  As in other areas  the obsession with sanctions — applied without calculating their consequences — might produce unpredictable results. It is absolutely necessary to eliminate the loopholes in the non-proliferation regimes  but that should be done through clear and non-discriminatory approaches  without creating grounds for suspicion regarding the existence of some hidden agenda.  Stagnation in the international disarmament process does not help to resolve non-proliferation problems. Here again  we need concerted action  for this is a matter of collective security.  In the area of strategic arms  the United States-Russian agreements play an enormously important role. Their significance goes far beyond the framework of bilateral relations  considering that virtually all members of the international community benefit from strategic stability. We support the consistent development of the United States-Russian bilateral disarmament process  as was stated by our Presidents in Saint Petersburg in July.   Closely related to that are issues related to anti-ballistic missiles  in particular within the context of the existing plans of the United States. In that context  there is a need for complete transparency and for an analysis of the consequences for strategic stability.  The situation surrounding the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe continues to cause grave concern. The old Treaty  based on the realities of confrontation between military blocs  has lost its relevance  while NATO is blocking the entry into force of the Agreement on its adaptation.  At the same time  reconfiguration of the military architecture on the European continent is under way. At its heart is an expanding military alliance. Such virtual arms control becomes meaningless as it turns into a one-way street.   It is also necessary to revitalize multilateral disarmament approaches. That agenda should include the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty  non-deployment of weapons in outer space  conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty and ensuring information security. Nuclear-weapon-free zones play an important role  and we welcome the creation of such a zone in Central Asia.  The overall task is to reinvigorate the efforts of the international community in the area of disarmament and arms control  within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament and other relevant United Nations bodies.   The 2005 World Summit unanimously reaffirmed that peace  security and development are inseparable. With that in mind  we are prepared to engage in collective discussions and support further joint pragmatic steps with a view to improving the efficiency of the social and economic activities of the entire United Nations system.  The Russian Federation realizes its responsibility as one of the fastest growing economies of the world  and is devoting increasing attention to development assistance. Thus far  Russia has written off or has undertaken to write off $11.3 billion of the debt of African countries  including more than $2.2 billion within the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. New steps are planned in that area. Russia now ranks third in absolute figures of debt relief and first in terms of the ratio of debt relief to gross domestic product. We have also increased our contributions to other international development assistance mechanisms  including through United Nations institutions and funds and the Bretton Woods institutions.  Today  I cannot fail to express my sincere appreciation and praise to the Secretary-General Kofi Annan. For many years  during the most difficult times for world politics  he has carried out his duties with dignity. Thanks largely to the efforts of Kofi Annan and to his ability to take the lead while remaining a realist in the face of severe challenges  we have managed to make progress in strengthening the United Nations.  Today the United Nations is relevant as never before. We do not have to create it anew. In the course of reforming the United Nations in accordance with the dictates of the time  it is incumbent upon us all to reaffirm by action our commitment to the world Organization  which draws its strength from our trust in it and in its unique legitimacy. Without the United Nations and its Charter to rely upon  it would prove impossible to ensure a more reliable and democratic system of collective security that would respond to the dictates of our time.

"148",6017,"RWA",61,2006,"I have the honour to deliver this statement on behalf of His Excellency Paul Kagame  President of the Republic of Rwanda  at this sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  Each year the General Assembly provides an excellent opportunity for us to review our collective commitments as reflected in the Charter  as well as more recent ones such as those set out in the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome. We therefore view the beginning of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly as an opportunity to breathe new energy into our collective responsibilities articulated at previous conferences and summits. It is my earnest hope that we shall seize this opportunity to take stock of our successes and shortcomings and devise practical solutions to realize these commitments  particularly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  In its preamble  the United Nations Charter expresses our collective determination to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom. This statement formed a basis for the Millennium Declaration in 2000 and our renewal of those commitments at last year’s World Summit. All of the outcomes of previous conferences and summits reflect the recognition of our collective interests and responsibilities in addressing the common problems affecting humankind.  Today  there is no greater danger threatening humanity than extreme poverty. Forty per cent of the world’s population  or 2.5 billion people  live in absolute poverty on less than $2 a day  while more than 800 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition. For sub-Saharan Africa  the statistics are even more staggering; in most cases  60 to 70 per cent of national populations live on less than a dollar a day  while life expectancy at birth is less than 50 years.  This is clearly unacceptable at a time when the rest of the world enjoys unprecedented levels of affluence and technological and scientific advancement. As for the poor  their daily lives are a trial that nobody would wish to experience. We must not permit another five years to pass only to find out that no progress has been made and only to simply renew the same commitments. We must  therefore  devise means to do things radically differently and in an accelerated manner.  There are a number of areas that require our urgent attention if we are to make progress in attaining the MDGs by 2015 and in eventually eradicating poverty. I will highlight a few of these areas  which  in our view  are the most salient. Regardless of one’s definition of good or effective governance  what has been proved is its importance in the sustained socio-economic development of a nation. We believe that the key features of good or effective governance include a political culture that fosters inclusive and competitive participation; robust national institutions that pursue effective and coherent national development strategies; effective management and oversight institutions; and  of course  the consolidation of the rule of law. It is our view that  by embracing good-governance principles  we are setting the stage for the attainment of our global and national targets.  Rwanda is strongly committed to these principles and has submitted itself to the scrutiny of our African peers under the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM). The APRM is an African   49 06-53323  initiative aimed at promoting good governance through constructive self-assessment and peer review. We welcome the acknowledgements of the progress we have made in many areas and commit ourselves to continuing to make improvements in the areas identified in the peer review report.  In the spirit of mutual accountability  it is our belief that the principles of good governance that prevail at the national level should also guide our relations with our development partners. Both sides of the ongoing governance debate should be given adequate and equal attention  particularly since aid effectiveness is also critical to the attainment of the MDGs.  We believe that improving the quality and increasing the quantity of official development assistance (ODA) is another important set of measures that would improve development prospects. The quality of ODA should be improved by adopting needs-based approaches  providing more budget support  supporting national poverty reduction programmes  reducing waste and overhead  and channelling aid to sectors that enhance productive capacities rather than perpetuate dependence.  It is critical that there be harmonization of the objectives of trade and development policies on the part of our development partners. Trade policies should complement  rather than undermine  the attainment of the development goals. We must recommit ourselves  both in principle and practice  to an open  rules-based  non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. Any progress that developing countries like Rwanda might achieve in attaining the MDGs will not be sustainable unless measures are taken to provide greater opportunity for those countries to access the markets of the developed world  thereby increasing household and national incomes.  The attainment of the MDGs will require additional resources. We thus consider it essential to increase the quantity of aid. We welcome the decision by some developed States to dramatically increase the volume of ODA over the next few years  and we are grateful to them. We also congratulate those States that have reached or exceeded the internationally agreed 0.7 per cent of gross national income for the ODA target  and we welcome the decision by those States that have set timetables to achieve or exceed that target by 2015. The challenge is  therefore  to translate these commitments into tangible disbursements and the implementation of real poverty reduction programmes on the ground.  The most serious challenge to our development and the attainment of the MDGs is the unprecedented price level of fossil-fuel energy on the one hand  and the reduction in hydroelectric generation capacity on the other.  There is a danger that the successes registered so far towards the attainment of the MDGs could easily be reversed if the current energy sector cost trends continue unabated. It is critical  therefore  that we invest heavily in sustainable alternative energy sources for the long term. In the short- and medium-term  however  we shall need to find ways to mitigate the effects of energy price shocks if we are to sustain and accelerate the attainment of the MDGs.  The scourge of war continues to cause the massive loss of human life and blight entire communities. The ongoing conflicts in some parts of Africa and the Middle East pose a serious threat to international peace and security and require our collective efforts to reach political settlements to these conflicts.  Our painful experience in Rwanda has taught us that peace comes at a price. There can be no peace without reconciliation and recognition of the rights and interests of all people  including the rights of States to exist and the right of self-determination. We have learned that no community’s rights can or should supersede another’s. We have learned the value of sharing and the value of communities’ living side by side in peace and mutual respect.  Rwanda is happy to contribute to the promotion of international peace and security through its military and police contributions to the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping missions in the Sudan  Liberia  Côte d’Ivoire and the Comoros. We are committed to continuing these contributions for as long as they are required and as long as our resources permit. The Security Council and the Secretariat should continue to work towards better-conceived and more-effective peacekeeping operations  towards greater participation by regional organizations in conflict resolution and towards the institutionalization of lessons learned from the past. There is also an urgent need to institutionalize relations between the United Nations and regional organizations  particularly the    06-53323 50  African Union  in the areas of conflict resolution and peacekeeping.  We warmly welcome the reforms adopted during the previous session of the General Assembly. We take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the sixtieth session  and all Member States on the reforms  including the setting up of the Peacebuilding Commission  the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the renewed commitments to combat HIV/AIDS adopted at the special session of the General Assembly in June. There has also been commendable progress on management reform  including the establishment of an ethics office  strengthening whistle-blower protection and reforming procurement procedures to prevent corruption. We look forward to working together with other delegations during this session to improve coherence  efficiency and effectiveness within the Secretariat and to continue to review the Organization’s mandates  so that the United Nations may be strengthened to respond better to the expectations of Member States.  It is our hope that this session of the General Assembly might achieve greater progress with respect to Security Council reform. Rwanda supports the common African position on this issue and believes that reform of the working methods to promote transparency and accountability is most urgent. The reform process should enable States that are not members of the Council to participate more actively in its deliberative and decision-making processes  especially on issues that affect them. A reformed Council should be seen by all States  especially the smaller States  to be more accessible  transparent  credible and legitimate.  In the next few months  the General Assembly will elect a new Secretary-General upon recommendation of the Security Council. Rwanda supports the common African position that the next Secretary-General should be from Asia. As far as the election process is concerned  we appeal for greater transparency in that process in accordance with the Charter and the basic principles of democracy.  In conclusion  in today’s globalized world  our interdependence has never been more self-evident. As a result  the imperative for our collective action is greater than ever. Once again  the onus is on all of us to translate our many challenges and opportunities into a shared destiny of peace  security and prosperity for all. "
"149",6059,"SAU",61,2006,"It honours me to deliver the statement of Saudi Arabia on behalf of Prince Saud Al-Faisal  Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At the outset  it gives me great pleasure to express to you and your Government my most sincere congratulations on your election as President of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. I am fully confident that your diplomatic expertise and thorough knowledge of international affairs will guarantee the success of this session. I would like to express my appreciation to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  Foreign Minister of Sweden  who presided over the previous session with wisdom and expertise. The constant and diligent efforts of the Secretary-General were essential for revitalizing the role of the United Nations and for upholding its principles  despite the difficult times and crucial challenges we face. He  therefore  deserves our full support and deepest gratitude.  The world today faces a host of global problems that can be successfully addressed only within the context of multilateral cooperation under the umbrella of the United Nations. Human suffering caused by poverty  hunger  malnutrition  the spread of diseases and epidemics and natural disasters still require the concerted efforts of the international community in combating them. These global challenges do not distinguish among people on the basis of colour  religion or nationality. Invariably  it is the most vulnerable who suffer the most from these humanitarian threats  making it all the more urgent for the international community to assume its collective responsibility in addressing these issues.  The Middle East is in the midst of a very dangerous phase  with the emergence of new crises and the worsening of old ones  such as the continued Israeli occupation of Arab lands in Palestine  Syria and Lebanon; the volatile situation on the Lebanese-Israeli border; the invasion of Lebanon; the challenges posed by continued instability and sectarian violence in Iraq; and the as-yet unresolved issue of Iran’s nuclear programme. The accumulation of crises and tensions in   51 06-53323  the region can only encourage an environment in which extremism and terrorism will thrive with undesirable consequences. It is  therefore  imperative that we warn specifically against the continued trend towards stopgap crisis management that has taken the place of the serious pursuit of a comprehensive and just solution based on the principles of international law and resolutions of international legitimacy free from partiality  double standards or selectivity.  Undoubtedly  the key to resolving these multiple crises will be to invigorate the peace process with the aim of achieving a just and durable settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict  the oldest conflict in modern times. This conflict is the most enduring international conflict today  and its continuation negatively affects the prospects of reaching effective solutions to other crises.   The ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine represents a flagrant breach of international law and the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force and blatant disregard for resolutions of international legitimacy. This issue lies at the core of the Middle Eastern problem. The international community should no longer tolerate procrastination or repeated failures in resolving this situation. The international community  and especially the major Powers  must set aside their divisions and face up to the vital task of reaching  as soon as possible  a peaceful  just and lasting solution  in accordance with the principles of international legitimacy.  The resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict must be placed in its appropriate context by reconciling the rights of the Palestinian and the Israeli people and establishing two neighbouring States enjoying security  which is a natural outcome of peace. It is peace that ensures security  and not the other way around. The basis for a solution is clear to all of us  as expressed by the President of the United States in the context of his two-State vision  which is in harmony with relevant United Nations resolutions and with the Arab Peace Initiative  adopted unanimously at the Beirut Summit. What is urgently needed today is to link that vision with a clear agenda bound to a specific time-frame.  Regrettably  the problem has been portrayed as inextricably complicated and not amenable to customary solutions. Using security considerations as a pretext  exceptional provisions allowed one of the parties to the conflict to specify unilaterally the basis and conditions for negotiations  to choose its negotiating partner  to violate previously concluded agreements  to impose unilateral measures and to use force to impose a status quo. Our purpose here is not to enter into futile debates  but it is important to recognize that the peace process has suffered greatly from these exceptions  which give rise to double standards and inequitable obligations.  Reviving the peace process will require serious international cooperation so as to realize the two-State vision within a reasonable time-frame. Recent events have once again proved that military solutions only undermine the interests and the security of all parties. It is therefore essential that we learn the lessons of our previous failures in the pursuit of peace. These failures resulted from an exaggerated emphasis on procedural and provisional issues. The establishment of interim security arrangements proved complicated and exhausting  while procedures for building mutual trust enabled the enemies of peace to undermine the peace process in its entirety.   What is required from us today is a fundamental change in our quest to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the area. It is imperative that we go to the root and heart of the conflict by establishing an effective mechanism to ensure immediate and peaceful negotiations addressing all final status issues  including Jerusalem  borders  refugees and mutual security arrangements. The required breakthrough can be achieved only through a historic and comprehensive deal.  A clear outline of the solution has been apparent ever since the adoption of resolution 181 (II) in 1947. That resolution set out the partition of Palestine  which was then under a British Mandate  into an Arab and an Israeli State. It also proposed clearly defined borders for those two States. Since then  the Security Council and the General Assembly have issued hundreds of resolutions  including Security Council resolution 242 (1967)  which emphasized the principle of refraining from the acquisition of territory by force  and called on Israel to withdraw from all territories occupied in 1967. It also reiterated the need to find a just solution to the issue of the Palestinian refugees. Thirty-nine years after the adoption of this resolution  the Palestinian people continue to be deprived of their inherent right to self-determination and of their entitlement to live in an independent State with Arab Jerusalem as its capital.    06-53323 52   Only two months ago Israel launched a brutal act of aggression against Lebanon  resulting in the destruction of Lebanon’s infrastructure  the displacement of one third of its population  and the wounding and killing of thousands of civilians  including women  children and the elderly. That senseless war  of course  did not make Israel any safer. The only thing achieved by Israel in Lebanon was vast destruction and devastation  provoking yet deeper hatred and enmity. We wonder how many tragedies and victims we and the world will have to have before everyone understands that military solutions will not succeed.   The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its full support for the legitimate Lebanese Government as it seeks to extend its authority and influence over its entire territory. The Kingdom also calls on the brotherly people of Lebanon to stand united so that their country may once again enjoy security and prosperity. We reiterate the need for all parties to remain committed to Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) and call for a rapid Israeli withdrawal from the Sheba’a Farms area  recognized by Israel as an occupied territory. We also call for a return to the Armistice Agreement signed between Lebanon and Israel in 1949  as this is the only means of guaranteeing security and stability and avoiding a return to the status quo ante.   As part of our commitment to reconstruction efforts in Lebanon  we call on the international community to hold Israel responsible for providing fair compensation for the destruction and losses inflicted upon Lebanon as a result of that aggression. One of the reasons why Lebanon has been a victim of repeated Israeli invasions — seven so far — is that we have not held the aggressor accountable.  We are profoundly concerned and extremely saddened by the deteriorating security situation in Iraq  marked by daily confrontation  acts of violence and bombings. The absence of security and stability in Iraq continues to hamper the efforts of all countries committed to assisting Iraq in overcoming its ordeal  rehabilitating its economy and helping it to rebuild. The Kingdom has always reaffirmed the importance of consolidating Iraq’s unity  respecting its independence and sovereignty  and refraining from interfering in its internal affairs. We call on the international community to support the programme adopted by the legitimate Iraqi Government  led by Mr. Nuri Al-Maliki  to achieve a comprehensive national reconciliation; revitalize Government institutions in the security  military  political and economic areas; and disarm the militias.  It has long been acknowledged that the proliferation of nuclear weapons has seriously undermined the security of all countries. Over time  a number of international treaties and conventions have produced bilateral and multilateral obligations  but such obligations are of no use if they are not fully observed and fully applied. We cannot ignore the serious threat to global peace and security that such weapons continue to pose  regardless of whether they are used in wars between States or fall into the hands of terrorist groups.  Effectively preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction will require abandoning double standards and emphasizing the importance of making the entire Middle East  including the Arab Gulf region  a zone free from nuclear weapons. Israel is the only country in the region that is known to possess weapons of mass destruction but is not subjected to any form of monitoring.  While we support the right of all countries to the peaceful use of nuclear energy — including the acquisition of know-how and nuclear technology for peaceful purposes — we call on all parties to support the path of negotiations and peaceful solutions with regard to the Iranian nuclear issue. Iran’s repeated statements that its nuclear programme is restricted to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should continue to serve as a strong basis for negotiations.   The Kingdom and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council are eager to maintain and enhance their relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran  and we hope that the Government of Iran will respond positively to the repeated calls by the United Arab Emirates for the peaceful resolution of the issue of the occupied islands belonging to the Emirates.  International terrorism is a threat to us all. The ongoing atrocities perpetrated by terrorists continue to test our resolve to combat and counter terrorism. There is no acceptable justification for any form of terrorism  but we cannot ignore the fact that it has roots and causes that enable it to thrive. Achieving a decisive victory over terrorism will require not only that we deny all financial support to terrorists  but also that we address the origins of extremist thought and the   53 06-53323  conditions in which terrorists prosper. If we address the feelings of despair  anger and frustration experienced by peoples when they are denied their legitimate rights  we will deprive extremists of their causes and rallying cries.  As one of the main targets of terrorism  the Kingdom has repeatedly denounced terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and has achieved tangible success in combating it. The Kingdom has acceded to most of the international counter-terrorism agreements  as well as the Arab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and the Convention of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on Combating International Terrorism. The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques  King Abdullah Bin Abdelaziz Al Saud  has proposed the establishment of an international counter-terrorism centre under United Nations auspices. The only way to thwart the evil plans of terrorists is through the exchange of intelligence and updated information among countries and agencies. Innovative solutions can be found to adequately address reservations regarding the sensitivity of such information and its secret sources.  As we renew our commitment to and participation in the international campaign against terrorism  we must at the same time draw attention to growing worldwide concerns about its flagrant use as a pretext by extremist forces and by advocates of a clash between civilizations and cultures.  We must periodically evaluate the effectiveness and success of our methods of combating terrorism and extremism. Here  I must reiterate that no true religion advocates the use of terrorism; all of the world’s great religions promote noble values. We should not hold the vast majority of true believers responsible for the deviant behaviour of a very small minority of adherents of any religion. Saudi Arabia strongly rejects the characterization of Islam as a violent religion that in any way supports terrorism. Saudi Arabia calls on all those who want to learn more about Islam and its attitude towards terrorism to consult reliable authorities or documents such as the 10-year plan of action adopted unanimously by the members of the OIC at its recent extraordinary summit held in Saudi Arabia. The success of the global counter-terrorism campaign will depend on our strict adherence to the rules of international law  human rights  norms and humanitarian values  and respect for all religions.  The continued humanitarian suffering in Darfur is unacceptable to all of us. We hope that the current efforts to remedy the situation will be given a chance to succeed. We hope that this destructive conflict  which is causing unjustifiable losses on all sides  will swiftly come to an end. The Sudanese authorities  who have achieved a historic success by bringing about reconciliation in the South  are cooperating with efforts to achieve reconciliation in Darfur  and have welcomed the deployment of African Union forces. Arab States have committed themselves to providing those forces with the support and financial resources that they need. We are concerned that the deployment of international troops without the consent of the sovereign Government of the Sudan will make them part of the problem  rather than part of the solution.   Saudi Arabia  itself a developing country  plays a major role in promoting development in other developing and least developed countries. To help those countries overcome their problems of poverty and underdevelopment  Saudi Arabia provides generous aid through its national institutions  as well as through international and regional institutions. Over the past three decades  Saudi Arabia has contributed approximately 4 per cent of its gross domestic product in official development assistance (ODA) — the highest percentage contributed by any country in the world. Saudi Arabia has also offered debt relief amounting to more than $6 billion to a number of least developed countries.  In order to ensure continued global economic growth  Saudi Arabia has increased its petroleum production capacity to stabilize petroleum markets  to ensure the continued flow of sufficient petroleum and to curb artificially high prices. Saudi Arabia hosts the secretariat of the International Energy Forum  which it established as a forum for discussing areas for cooperation and dialogue between petroleum-consuming and petroleum-producing countries. Increased cooperation between those countries will contribute directly to the stabilization of petroleum markets. Petroleum  of course  is an essential strategic commodity for the promotion of sustained global economic growth.  Our world is experiencing ever-accelerating and increasingly complex political  economic and social changes. Now more than ever  it is vital that we cooperate with one another to address the complex issues and changes facing us. Balanced and respectful    06-53323 54  relations among countries  based on the principles of justice  mutual trust and true partnership  are essential to that end. Promoting healthy relations and understanding among nations will best equip us to meet future challenges and to respond to them in a way that will benefit all of humanity. "
"150",6099,"SDN",61,2006,"On behalf of the General Assembly  I have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Omer Hassan Al-Bashir  President of the Republic of the Sudan  and to invite him to address the Assembly.  President Al-Bashir (spoke in Arabic): It gives me great pleasure  Madam  to extend my warmest congratulations to you on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. There is no doubt that your election is an honour for us  because of the excellent relations between our two sisterly countries. I am fully confident that you will lead our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I would like also to commend your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the efficient way in which he guided the work of the previous session. I seize this opportunity  furthermore  to express our appreciation for the endeavours of the United Nations Secretariat in the past period.  The Members of the United Nations are about to select a new Secretary-General. We hope that they will choose a new Secretary-General who will undertake his duties in a neutral  objective and transparent manner  so that our Organization can achieve the purposes to which we all aspire  serving the international community in achieving peace  stability and global prosperity.  I take this opportunity to welcome the Republic of Montenegro to membership of this Organization.  This session has special importance for my country. It occurs on the fiftieth anniversary of the Sudan joining the United Nations after it gained its independence in the mid-twentieth century. The five decades that have passed since then have strengthened the aspirations of our country and our people for an effective and fair United Nations  as well as our conviction that the independence and political freedom achieved by our country  as well as our hopes for a bright  prosperous and developed future  could be destroyed by the challenges of the present phase  including the double standards  the dangers of hegemony and the use of international forums to achieve political  economic or strategic objectives.  The Government and the people of the Sudan eagerly seek peace  which has become our strategic objective. Because of our sincere will and strong desire  peace has become a living reality. In January 2005 we witnessed the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. That Agreement did merely address the causes of the dispute between the south and the north  but offered fair solutions to all the problems faced by our country. It established political rules for a system that recognizes citizenship as a basis for rights and duties  and that recognizes diversity and considers it to be a source of strength and unity. The system is    06-52737 44  based on power-sharing  democratic principles  the rule of law  good governance and respect for human rights and freedoms.  In the economic area  that Agreement establishes rules for wealth-sharing in accordance with criteria of fairness  brotherhood and equality between the central Government and the provinces of the south and the north. The Agreement is based on sound principles and standards of justice and thus establishes the correct rules for a comprehensive peace  which should prevail throughout the country.  The implementation of the Agreement has progressed at the national level. A Government of National Unity has been formed  as was a Government of South Sudan. Legislative bodies have also been established  as well as the National Constitutional Review Commission  the National Judicial Services Commission and the National Petroleum Commission. All options were presented to the President  who selected the best among them. At the moment  serious efforts continue to complete work on the other commissions realistically  objectively and with good intentions. We have also begun  in cooperation with the United Nations  to prepare for the return of refugees and displaced persons  some of whom have already returned.  We were convinced that peace would not fully succeed unless it also prevailed among our people in Darfur. I am pleased to convey to the Assembly that in May we were able to sign the Darfur Peace Agreement  in Abuja. That had been a principal objective since the conflict in that region began. We express our deep gratitude and appreciation to all those who contributed to bringing about that great achievement  prominent among them the African Union  which has contributed troops since the beginning of the crisis and has sponsored the negotiations on the issue. We also thank sisterly Nigeria  which has hosted the negotiations  and the other partners who have worked to bring the divergent views closer together and have spared no effort in pushing the parties towards an agreement. The great role undertaken by the African Union in Darfur is proof of what regional organizations can do to settle disputes in their regions.  That pioneering experiment should impel the Security Council to encourage all such organizations and genuinely and objectively support them in the maintenance of regional peace and security  in accordance with the United Nations Charter and without their efforts being aborted or their roles pre-empted by certain hegemonic parties that have their own illegal agendas.  We have begun steps to implement the Agreement  through ongoing consultations with the African Union and the Sudanese parties that are signatories to the Agreement  in particular concerning security arrangements  the sharing of power and wealth and the return of displaced persons  in addition to preparing for the Darfur-Darfur dialogue.  We have buttressed the implementation effort — which is being carried out according to a timetable — by appointing Mr. Minni Arko Minawi  leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement  as senior assistant to the President and Chairman of the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority. the Authority will be responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Agreement. Those steps will take us to the final phase: completion of all the mechanisms necessary to implement the Agreement.  Here we reaffirm the Government of National Unity’s commitment to the Agreement in letter and in spirit. I take the opportunity to sincerely invite all the parties that have not yet signed the Agreement or joined the peace process to do so  in order to consolidate national efforts towards attaining stability.  If the armed factions continue to refuse to join the peace efforts  and persist in violence against and intimidation of citizens  they must be isolated and prevented from acting  in accordance with the Abuja Peace Agreement  which also stipulates that efforts by all signatories to the Agreement should be encouraged  in order to accelerate full implementation in letter and in spirit. The international community would thus be enabled to assist us in strengthening our capacity to bring about rehabilitation and reconstruction.  We hope and expect that the international community will fulfil its commitments concerning the cancellation of all of our foreign debt to States or to financial institutions  and will lift all restrictions and economic and trade sanctions that had been imposed by some international parties. These are impeding our reconstruction and development efforts. We will thus be able to shoulder the burden of reconstruction  increase the rate of growth and provide a life of dignity for our people.   45 06-52737   It is regrettable that some influential international parties  rather than fulfilling their pledges and commitments and respecting the provisions of the Abuja Peace Agreement  continue instead to undermine those efforts through unfair and unjustifiable pressures and partiality  and through the negative signals that they send to non-signatories of the Abuja Agreement. This has culminated in the exploitation of the Security council  which has adopted resolutions that serve those parties’ interests and strategies  such as Council resolution 1706 (2006) which seeks to undermine national and regional endeavours to implement the Abuja Agreement  as that resolution contradicts the Agreement in letter and in spirit. Indeed  it would place our country under the trusteeship of those influential parties. That makes it imperative to continue our efforts to implement the Abuja Agreement and to mobilize the resources and funding necessary to achieve a sustainable peace in Darfur  so that our country and our region can enjoy the fruits of that peace. Mr. Jenie (Indonesia)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Our country refuses all forms of dictates and all attempts to humiliate it and usurp its national will. It wholly rejects any attempts to re-colonize us in a new  sly manner. Thus we reject all attempts to impose new international forces in Darfur without taking into account Darfur’s special circumstances and without consultations with the Government of Sudan. The subject has become  in itself  a goal in the service of some internal political objectives of some parties.  World leaders who met here last September to follow up the results of the Millennium Summit adopted a document that calls for reform of the United Nations  the promotion of international peace and security  respect for human rights  adoption of collective measures to combat poverty and bringing about development and  in particular as regards issues pertaining to funding development based on the Monterrey Consensus.  What has been agreed to with regard to promoting the role of the United Nations calls upon us to work collectively with the necessary political will  particularly on the part of the permanent members of the Security Council. That should enable the Organization to carry out its work in a truly democratic manner.  In this context  we call for agreement on reform of the Security Council and updating its working methods. The Council’s present composition does not achieve this; it is an impediment to what we are seeking — real democracy in the management of international relations. What makes the call for reform more imperative is the eruption of conflicts that threaten peace and security without the Council making any effective move to contain them. A good case in point are the tragic developments in the Middle East. The Council watched helplessly while those developments occurred. This emphasizes the point that structural and institutional reform of the Security Council has become more imperative today than ever before.  In this context  my delegation reaffirms its commitment to the African position as stipulated in the Ezulwini document  a position that was reiterated at the African summits held in Serte  Khartoum and Banjul.  The follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit has shown clearly that what has been achieved has not met our expectations  particularly in regard to the African continent  which is bleeding to death under its debt burden and is facing an incompatible  non-conducive economic and trade environment. The problems of hunger  poverty and disease in Africa have reached very serious dimensions and constitute a great threat to the international community. They will continue to haunt us unless efforts by the international community are consolidated in order to accelerate fairer development in developing countries  particularly in the least developed ones. It will be impossible to reach the Millennium Development Goal of reducing poverty by half by the year 2015. The correct path towards achieving the MDGs requires that we emphasize the importance of total debt cancellation  as debts are a great impediment to bringing about those goals  particularly in Africa and in the least developed countries.  We attach great importance to the fact that developed countries should fulfil their commitments concerning financing for development and implementing the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries. They should work to reform financing institutions  which will promote transparency and lead to larger representation for developing countries in such institutions. They should increase technical and financial assistance so that an investment environment for the private sector can be    06-52737 46  created  suitable infrastructures can be brought about  the environment can be protected and corruption can be combated.  The imposition of unilateral coercive economic measures on developing countries constitutes an impediment to freedom of commerce and investment. Funding issues and the transfer of technology are still main components of sustainable development. Here we would like to emphasize the provision of assistance to the least developed countries in social services  education  health care  and for combating diseases such as AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria  which kill millions of people every year.  We seize this opportunity to reaffirm once again our commitment to what we agreed on in the Millennium Declaration and to reaching the Goals contained therein for a better life for humanity as a whole  with full emphasis on the right of developing countries to determine their own development priorities without restrictions or prior conditions that would hinder their development efforts. We would like to highlight also the importance of guaranteeing that the proposed new financing mechanisms will not negatively impact investment flows.  The Sudan has made great efforts towards achieving those Goals and has achieved noticeable progress  particularly in reducing the poverty rate and expanding public education  despite the unjust embargo and the longstanding conflict in the south of the country.  My country has expressed its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and has called for the adoption of an international strategy to combat it. In this context  we believe that the definition of terrorism distinguishes it clearly from the just struggle by people to preserve their legitimate right to defend their freedom and the right to self-determination. That must be the main pillar on which the international community should fully agree. The Sudan believes in the international campaign to combat the phenomenon of terrorism  in accordance with the United Nations Charter  principles of international law and the inviolability of the sovereignty of States.  The question of Palestine is a story that embodies the suffering of a people that has been deprived of its political and economic rights. The Israeli occupation continues to be a heavy burden on the legitimate Palestinian dreams to bring about freedom and development. The international community must force Israel to fulfil the obligations it has undertaken  including the road map  halting construction of the separation wall  and heeding the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice issued in July 2004. This was adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth emergency session  enabling the Palestinian people to exercise its right to self-determination and to establish an independent State  with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.  We renew our full support to the Palestinian people and its elected institutions. We call on the international community to respect the choices made by the Palestinian people and to shoulder its responsibilities vis-à-vis the Palestinian Government — which has come about through free and fair elections — to lift the embargo imposed against it and to support it. We call upon the international community to pressure Israel to halt its ongoing aggression against the Gaza Strip and release the abducted Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians.  The Israeli aggression against Lebanon last August  which targeted innocent civilians — women and children — has shaken the world’s conscience. This is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and agreements. We would like to express our full solidarity with the people and the Government of Lebanon and with the resistance. We commend their steadfastness in the face of this flagrant aggression  and we hold Israel responsible for the destruction and the sabotage of brotherly Lebanon. We call for the establishment of an international commission to investigate the war crimes perpetrated by Israel  and we call also on international  regional and volunteer organizations to intensify their emergency efforts to provide assistance to the victims.  We have always been convinced that the volatility of the situation in the Middle East and the ongoing tensions are due to the Israeli occupation  and that a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the advent of peace in the region cannot be achieved unless Israel withdraws completely from all the territories occupied since 1967  including the occupied Syrian Golan and the Shab’a farms.  We wish to emphasize in that context the importance of making the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction  with no exceptions  in   47 06-52737  order to bring about security and stability  which would benefit all the peoples of the region.  We reiterate our support for Iraq and its territorial integrity. We believe that its sovereignty should extend to all its territory  and we call on all segments of Iraqi society to engage in dialogue with a view to resolving their problems. We welcome the initiative of the League of Arab States to hold a national reconciliation conference  and we support all sincere efforts aimed at bringing stability to brotherly Iraq  so that it can resume its rightful place in the regional context.  In Somalia  there have been recent positive developments in the reconciliation process led by the Sudan  in coordination with the Arab League  which have led to the Somali Transitional Federal Government signing an agreement with the Islamic Courts Union and a reconciliation statement in Khartoum in June 2006. There is no doubt that this will promote the reconciliation efforts currently led at the regional level by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). We hope that our brothers in Somalia will continue the dialogue and promote reconciliation efforts in order to bring about stability and security  so that sisterly Somalia can transcend this very difficult phase.  We are fully convinced that Africa is rich in human resources and cultural heritage and that it has the material and human means to ensure a bright future for itself. However  Africa faces many complex challenges  such as the achievement of stability and development.  Unless all of Africa works in a united and concerted manner  it will not be possible to realize our aspirations. We in Africa  more than anyone else  are responsible for translating those aspirations into reality. We are prepared to work  in an effective partnership with others  to do so. That will benefit our African peoples and contribute to stability at the international level  as envisaged by the New Partnership for Africa’s Development initiative.  The Great Lakes region is emerging from a lengthy and deadly conflict  which has given way to a phase in which democracy is taking root. The International Conference for the Great Lakes Region  which is still in the preparatory stages and is aimed at defining conditions and criteria conducive to ongoing regional cooperation among the States of the region  will hold its second summit next December in Nairobi to adopt a treaty on security and stability in the region. The process is facilitated by the United Nations  the African Union and some of our partners and is tangible proof of the genuine political will of the countries of the region. It is a unique initiative to build peace in the region.  I should like from this rostrum to call on the international community to step up the pace in the provision of the financial and political support necessary to push this treaty forward and ensure its adoption for the Great Lakes region. We call for support for the implementation of that treaty  so that the peoples of the region will cease being victimized by disputes  humanitarian disasters or insecurity and be able to realize their aspirations to peace  stability and development.

"151",6144,"SEN",61,2006,"Senegal and the Kingdom of Bahrain have had cordial relations of friendship  which have been enhanced and strengthened by reciprocal confidence and esteem. I am therefore pleased that Ms. Haya Rashed al-Khalifa is presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  during a key time in the history of our organization. Her election was an act of faith in the ideals of the United Nations and a message of hope for peoples who dream of a fairer  more equitable and more welcoming world for all. I offer her my warmest congratulations and assure her of the full cooperation of the Senegalese delegation as she carries out her high responsibilities in the service of the international community.   I would also like to convey to the Secretary-General a fraternal message of my greatest appreciation and gratitude for the ability and effectiveness with which he has always acted  enabling our Organization to better adapt to the requirements of the new millennium. At a time when he is preparing to leave his high post after 10 years of loyal and good service  it is with a sincere sense of pride that I say to him as an African compatriot  “Mr. Secretary-General  mission accomplished”.   Last year  in this very Hall  we renewed our commitment to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. To be sure  since that time  some praiseworthy initiatives have occurred along the way  especially with measures to erase the multilateral debt of 18 least developed countries (LDCs) and to establish a levy on air tickets as a source of financing for development. I salute the efforts made by President Jacques Chirac of France and by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil for their promotion of this innovative mechanism to mobilize resources.   The problem of debt  however  in particular the debt of our continent  remains a hindrance to our development. In reality  the first question we should be asking ourselves  and which we do ask in Africa    5 06-53005  regards the evaluation of the debt: to take a look at the overindebtedness of Africa  to see exactly how much we owe  because it turns out that some countries are paying more than they owe. This is why I have long been advocating an x-ray of African debt to see how our countries have ended up in a situation whereby they devote much of their export earnings to paying off debt  contracted sometimes in dubious circumstances  to the detriment of their economic and social development programmes. The vicious circle of debt  compounded by unfair imbalances in international trade owing to agricultural subsidies in wealthy industrialized countries  has been particularly harmful for our farmers.   The failure of the agriculture negotiations in the Doha round  which is still fresh in our memory  shows how far we have yet to go in order to ensure respect by all for the rules of the game  so that world trade can be equally profitable for the giants of agro-business as for the small-scale cotton growers of Senegal  Benin  Burkina Faso and Mali  or for the small-scale coffee planters from Uganda  Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. We say yes to free trade  but it must be fair and equitable.  The dizzying increase in the price of oil and its by-products since 2003 constitutes a new source of concern for non-producer countries. If the current trend continues  many countries will see their years of economic and social development efforts wiped out by the cost of oil. It will then be pointless to expound on the Millennium Development Goals on schooling  universal health care  access to drinking water for all  the fight against unemployment and the eradication of poverty.   In Africa  we have decided to take up the challenge by gathering together  on the initiative of Senegal  in the Association of Non-Oil Producing African Countries  in order to promote the development of bio-fuels. This green version of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has already been launched. With its vast cultivatable lands and enormous fresh water resources  Africa has  without a doubt  incomparable advantages in this sphere  and could even aspire to become the world’s premier bio-fuel producer.   I would call upon all interested parties to join with us in this new green energy revolution  especially since it respects our environment and is in perfect harmony with the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. Let us be optimistic in thinking that our planet will be a healthier place in the interest of all peoples  thanks to a civilization based on clean energy.   Turning to the situation in Africa  Senegal welcomes the progress made in democracy on the continent  as well as the significant progress achieved in the peaceful settlement of disputes. Such positive developments  however  have been thwarted by the persistence of some hotbeds of tension. In the Sudan  we hope and work for the expansion of the camp of peace  so that those protagonists who have thus far been left out of the peace process can sign the Abuja Agreement for a settlement of the Darfur crisis.   Yesterday  here in New York  the Peace and Security Council of the African Union addressed the issue of Darfur and emphasized that Africa must offer more efforts  more sacrifices and more commitment  but that it can find a solution only within the framework of close cooperation with the United Nations  for which it must indicate its readiness.   Turning to the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Senegal welcomes the holding of elections last July. We hope that  whatever the outcome of the second round of presidential elections on 30 October  a reconciled Congolese people will work in the spirit of unity to utilize the tremendous potential of their country for peace  national unity and economic and social progress.   To my Ivorian brothers and sisters I would like to solemnly state that the need for a Côte d’Ivoire  healed of its wounds for good  has become most urgent — as much for themselves as for all of us in the subregion. I would thus urge Ivorian leaders of all ideologies to show that they can get beyond their differences to foster a return to lasting peace  more in accordance with the history of that brother country and with its proper destiny within the West African family and within our continent.   With regard to the Digital Solidarity Fund  which I proposed in December 2003 at the World Summit in the Information Society  as information technology and communications coordinator of The New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)  I am pleased to report that we have had satisfactory results. Since being launched in March 2005 with the support of nearly all Members of the United Nations  the Fund has gained the formal support of the People’s Republic of    06-53005 6  China. I would like warmly to thank the Chinese authorities for their support  which surely bolsters the Fund’s universal nature. I request all States that have not yet done so to formalize their previously voiced commitment to the Fund by sending a letter to the Executive Secretary of the Fund in Geneva. I would recall that cities too can become members. I take this opportunity also to recall that the Digital Solidarity Fund is supported exclusively through voluntary public and private contributions  the amount of which is up to member States  cities or local governments.   We would suggest that countries commit themselves to the so-called Geneva Principle  which consists of  including in calls for bids in the digital technology field   a contribution to the Fund of 1 per cent of the value of the goods and services linked to information and communications technology. Fund resources are managed in strict transparency through the Foundation Council with a tripartite membership: local authorities  private enterprise and civil society.   The General Assembly’s recent High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development shows the extent to which we must continue our joint efforts to address an extremely relevant and complex problem which will be with us for a long time to come. International migration has always been a part of the history of peoples. What is new is the current scope and form of illegal immigration. For a wide variety of reasons  with North-South imbalances not the least of them  illegal migration necessitates an approach of joint partnership instead of unilateral solutions.   In Senegal  we have already decided to resolutely combat this phenomenon by strengthening the surveillance of our coasts with the support of our European partners. We have already signed an agreement with Spain  and we shall sign a similar agreement with France next week. The purpose of these agreements is to regulate migratory flows to developed countries  thereby combating illegal migration. The smugglers  largely responsible for this  are constantly being hunted down and punished in accordance with the law.   Along with the dismantling of clandestine networks  we have launched our Return to Agriculture programme  through which we are setting up rural farms in order to enable our young people to engage in modern agriculture and animal husbandry. This will give them reasons to stay at home and avoid tragic ventures which often end at the bottom of the sea or in the desert. That is how we implement the principle we have adopted in Senegal: zero illegal emigration.  The year 2006 marks a decisive turning point in the history of the United Nations  with reforms under way to adapt to changing world realities. These include the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  which I hope will allow for enhanced promotion of human rights and more effective management of post-conflict periods.   As for Security Council reform  Senegal deplores the deadlock in the negotiations  which is to the detriment of regions such as ours. Africa  while it is the focal point of the Council’s agenda  does not have a single permanent seat. That is a historical injustice which must be corrected as soon as possible by granting Africa a seat  with the right to veto  apart from the overall reform package.   The Palestinian people  too  are victims of injustice  depriving them of a legitimate right to a viable  free and independent State. History teaches us that war  despite its long list of innocent victims and the toll it takes on civilian infrastructure — bitter experiences recently relived by the peoples of Lebanon and Palestine — will never overcome a people’s will if it aspires to take its rightful place in the community of free nations.  The right to freedom and independence is part of the destiny of peoples. Its attainment can be delayed by historic circumstances  but destiny will always be achieved. It is better to understand this in time than to regret it too late.   As Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People  Senegal will continue to ensure that the Organization continues its efforts towards a negotiated  just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict so that all of the suffering peoples of the region can finally live in peaceful coexistence.  With regard to Iran  the Assembly is aware of my position. There should be dialogue without prior conditions  meaning that the protagonists should sit down around a negotiating table.   Senegal has always acted in the service of peace and continues to do so more than ever before at a time when we face such major challenges.  "
"152",6191,"SGP",61,2006,"I join other countries in congratulating you  Madam  on your assumption of the presidency. We in Singapore pledge our full support to you.  The recent war in Lebanon had no clear victor. Israel succeeded in removing the immediate threat across the border  but could not wipe out Hizbollah. Hizbollah claimed victory  having survived Israeli air bombardments and ground action  even though enormous damage was inflicted on Lebanon. On both sides  innocent people have suffered greatly. Whether the present ceasefire can become a lasting peace depends on many factors  not least the ability of the Lebanese army and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon to maintain the buffer in southern Lebanon. But one thing is clear: without the eventual intervention of the United Nations  the fighting would have continued and more lives would have been lost.  The Middle East is going through the throes of change. In Palestine  there is no escaping a two-State solution. However  defining the precise boundaries of that solution is a grinding process which will take time. No one can achieve all his demands; no party can insist on absolute security. A new balance is being established between Sunnis and Shiites in Lebanon  Iraq and elsewhere in the region. This will also take time. In many countries  there is tension between those who are impatient for change and those who believe that discontinuity will lead to chaos and anarchy. As long as there is more despair than hope  terrorist organizations will be able to find fresh recruits. What happens in the Middle East affects the entire world. No country is insulated  and certainly not from the terrorist threat or from high energy prices.  No grand solution is possible. The end of the cold war marked the end of an era when the major Powers could settle the terms among themselves over the heads of lesser countries. It was not that long ago — but it seems so strange today — that a cold peace could have been maintained for decades by each side pointing tens of thousands of nuclear missiles at the other. Technology has changed the rules. Warfare has now become asymmetric. Cruise missiles and submarines cannot solve the problem of suicide bombers. And those who manipulate these terrorists might well take positions in global financial markets to benefit from the havoc that they create.  In a sense  technology has globalized the world and broken it into smaller pieces. Empires have broken up. New countries have been born. In large countries     06-53323 24  power has devolved downwards and regions have become more assertive. It has become a messier world  which presents new challenges to global governance. Improving global governance from above sometimes seems like an impossible task. Take the reform of the United Nations  for example: despite all the efforts made and the fine speeches delivered  the results have been quite modest.   The near-collapse of the Doha talks is another example of how difficult it is to effect change from the top down. When the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was formed in 1948  there were only 23 members. Today  the World Trade Organization has 149 members. No country or group of countries seems able or willing to take the lead in brokering a compromise. We must hope that Director-General Pascal Lamy will succeed in his heroic efforts to rescue the Doha development round from failure.   There are other areas in which global action is needed  but is insufficient. All of us worry about global climate change  but how can there be consensus when the costs and benefits are distributed so unevenly and the major polluters are unwilling to accept responsibility? We hear dire warnings from the World Health Organization about a global flu pandemic  yet our collective response is so feeble.  While we should never give up hope on global initiatives  we should be realistic  because achieving global consensus in a multipolar world is  to say the least  challenging. When Governments have to win elections  they are more likely to respond to short-term political needs than to worry about long-term global concerns. We can often do more at the regional level: at the regional level  the stakes are clearer to our constituencies and the need for action is easier to explain. The Charter recognizes the role that regional arrangements can play in helping the United Nations to achieve its objectives.  In a globalized world with porous borders  regional cooperation can often bring quick benefits. We need only consider  for example  the simple act of reopening  three months ago  after 44 years  the Nathu La pass in the Himalayas between China and India. Immediately  on both sides of the pass  ordinary people benefited from trade and travel. New problems will arise  of course  but they can be managed.  All over the world now  regional initiatives are proliferating. Many overlap. Some are modest in their objectives  providing forums for public and private sector leaders to meet and consult. Others are more ambitious  creating regional free-trade areas or fostering joint efforts against problems like drug trafficking and terrorism. Many of these regional initiatives are open and inclusive  and should be encouraged. Those which are superfluous will gradually wither away. Some can make significant contributions to global governance and reduce the burdens borne by the big Powers. International organizations like the United Nations  the World Trade Organization  the World Health Organization  the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations Environment Programme should work with them  strengthen their capabilities and encourage mutual learning. These initiatives create a habit of cooperation among neighbouring countries and reduce misunderstanding.  In Asia  the role of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has not only been beneficial to the 10 countries of South-East Asia; it has also helped to create a larger architecture of cooperation. Founded 39 years ago  in 1967  when the war in Indo-China was raging  ASEAN began as a grouping to promote what then-President Suharto of Indonesia called “regional resilience”. The original five non-communist countries of ASEAN — Indonesia  Malaysia  Thailand  the Philippines and Singapore — were determined to keep the peace among ourselves and concentrate on economic development. Brunei Darussalam joined ASEAN in 1984 after it became independent. With the end of the cold war  peace returned to Indochina and ASEAN gradually expanded to include the newer member States of Viet Nam  Cambodia  Laos and Myanmar  to become what it is today: a community of 10.  In 1992  the countries of ASEAN decided to establish a free trade area in stages. For trade in goods  we have largely attained our objectives. For investment and services  we still have some way to go. But there is considerable political will to press on and make the whole of ASEAN one economic space. Already  ASEAN as a grouping plays a major role in international trade  accounting for some 6 per cent of total world trade.  The re-emergence of China and India as major Powers presents us with opportunities as well as challenges. ASEAN’s trade with both is growing rapidly. But they are also a competitive challenge to us.    25 06-53323   When the leaders of ASEAN met in Bali three years ago  they took a major decision: to establish an ASEAN Community by 2020 with three main pillars — security  economic cooperation and cultural cooperation. To create such a community  an ASEAN charter will be drawn up next year to provide the legal basis for our future integration. It will include provisions for dispute settlement by independent panels.  The European Union is an inspiration to us in ASEAN. Two months ago  the European Commission hosted members of an ASEAN eminent persons group and generously offered advice and assistance. While ASEAN integration will never be as deep or as broad as that of the European Union  there is much that we can learn from the European experience.  For ASEAN to prosper  it is important that we maintain good relations with all the major Powers. For many years now  ASEAN has promoted good relations with our dialogue partners  including the United States  the European Union  Russia  China  Japan and India. With strong growth in global trade  ASEAN has negotiated or is in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with China  India  Japan  Korea  Australia and New Zealand  and closer economic partnerships with the United States and the European Union. We have a simple strategy  which is to give all of them a strong stake in our unity and in our development. Strategically  some of the most important sea lanes pass through ASEAN waters. About a third of global trade  half of global oil trade and 80 per cent of the oil bound for China and Japan pass through the straits of Malacca and Singapore.  Through the ASEAN-plus groupings and the East Asia Summit  which includes China  Japan  Korea  India  Australia and New Zealand  we are creating a new architecture of peaceful cooperative development in the larger Asia. ASEAN is not big enough to be a major global player  but ASEAN plays a significant role in holding Asia together and keeping it open to the rest of the world. Whatever we do in Asia must not cause the United States  the European Union or Russia to think that we are excluding them.  ASEAN is a work in progress. Like other regions in the world  we face many problems  related to economic development  separatist movements  terrorism  drug trafficking  environmental degradation  maritime security  ethnic and religious divisions and avian flu  among other issues. However  what each of us in ASEAN has come to appreciate is that  without ASEAN  each of these problems is much harder to solve  and that ASEAN alone cannot solve any of them: we have to be united and work with other countries and with international organizations. We are grateful for their assistance  their partnership and their cooperation.  Madam President  ASEAN strongly supports you and the United Nations. We will work with you to improve the workings of the United Nations and to make it more effective. In this regard  ASEAN continues to endorse the candidature of Mr. Surakiart Sathirathai as the next Secretary-General despite the recent coup in Thailand. Although the coup was a setback to both Thailand and ASEAN  Thai society has a deep resilience which will enable it to recover quickly. ASEAN will always be on the side of the Thai people.   If every region in the world  working with the United Nations  can help to stabilize its own immediate environment and promote favourable conditions for development  the prospects for global peace will be enhanced. What the nations of Africa have been able to do despite adverse circumstances is impressive. The willingness of individual African countries to agree on common positions is unique to that continent and is an inspiration to the rest of us.   The United Nations is already stretched and can only do so much. Instead  let us  in each of our regions  do our part and work with the United Nations and its organizations in a complementary way. In order to stop the killing Darfur  for example  we need close cooperation between the United Nations and African countries.  Wherever possible  regional organizations should be strengthened. The United Nations and other international organizations can play a facilitating role  provide resources and advice  set standards and establish benchmarks. Even in the Middle East  where the work often seems hardest  regional cooperation can help create a better environment for peace and development. For example  the reconstruction of Iraq will be much more difficult  if not impossible  without the goodwill of its neighbours.  With over 500 million people  ASEAN has 8 per cent of the world’s population. Our share of global gross domestic product is much lower  at 2 per cent.    06-53323 26  But within the limits of our modest capabilities  we in ASEAN will do our part to contribute to the good work of the United Nations in making this a better world  not adding to its problems.

"153",6224,"SLB",61,2006,"I bring warm greetings from the Government and the people of Solomon Islands. Allow me to begin by conveying my most heartfelt and sincere congratulations to you  Madam  on your election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Solomon Islands is confident that  as a result of your leadership  guidance and service to the world  our work to achieve global peace  progress and prosperity will bear fruit. My delegation assures you of our cooperation and support during your term in office.  Solomon Islands would also like to take this opportunity to applaud and pay tribute to your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  Foreign Minister of Sweden  who  with truly admirable skill  led us in achieving many reform initiatives following last year's World Summit  in particular the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council  the launch of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy  the adoption of the development resolution  management reform  Secretariat mandate review and the Declaration on HIV/AIDS.  It would be remiss of me not to thank our Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his distinguished service to this premier institution. He has been a constant catalyst for change and has distinguished himself by combining leadership with vision  initiative  patience  respect  persistence and faith in this institution. Solomon Islands continues to render him and the Secretariat staff our support. We wish the Secretary-General well in his future endeavours and sincerely thank him for his service.  Solomon Islands would also like to join others in warmly welcoming the newest Member  the Republic of Montenegro  which was admitted into the United Nations family in June this year. We wish the new nation every success and look forward to working with it for the common good of the globe.  Democracy remains the bedrock of the Solomon Islands political system. My Government came to power four months ago  following the country’s seventh national election since its attainment of political independence 28 years earlier. We were fortunate in having the Electoral Assistance Division of    06-53323 2  the United Nations Department of Political Affairs monitor and coordinate the international observers who oversaw this election. Despite the positive verdict of the international observers  a minor hiccup occurred during the second part of the election and led to three days of rioting. Solomon Islands looks at that incident as a wake-up call  urging that more be done for the development of its growing population. I am pleased to say that the incident is now behind us  stability has been restored and a Commission of Inquiry has been set up to look into the matter.  Solomon Islands would like to thank all those that participated in the election observer programme including the Commonwealth  the Pacific Islands Forum  Australia  New Zealand and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). My Government has gone ahead and put in place some integrity legislation that will strengthen the development of the party system in Solomon Islands and bring about needed political stability.  Like many young democracies  Solomon Islands is being challenged and tested. Governance is expensive and needs support in order to be nurtured and to flourish. Political ideology should belong to all  not only to those that can afford it.  The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands  led by Australia and supported by New Zealand and all the Pacific Islands Forum countries  has just completed its third year. My Government has renewed the Regional Assistance Mission’s term for another twelve months  given the Mission’s success in transforming the country from a fragile to a stable State. Solomon Islands is undertaking a comprehensive review of the Mission in an effort to strengthen the existing partnership  with the objective of broadening the scope and role of the Mission so that it can take a more development-oriented approach.  The theme of this session  “Implementing a Global Partnership for Development”  demands a renewed commitment to existing partnerships between developed and developing countries and presents an opportunity to reorder and close the North-South divide through a strengthened multilateral system.   Just last week  more than one quarter of the most vulnerable Members of the United Nations  the least developed countries  met here in this Assembly to review the Brussels Programme of Action. These countries have special needs and require special attention. While we welcome the declaration issued by the High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action  it is not the declaration that implements the Brussels Programme of Action  rather it is our action in honouring our international obligations and commitments.  Solomon Islands is a country of small communities  scattered across nine hundred islands. Sustainable development for Solomon Islands can be achieved only through a global partnership in which development is directed at rural communities. The approach must have a sense of urgency and the common purpose of enabling the rural population to exploit their resources thanks to the transfer of appropriate technologies and thus to realize their economic aspirations.  The shape and future of international relations depends on how we manage change. According to Charles Darwin  it is not the strongest of the species that survives  nor the most intelligent  but rather the one most responsive to change.   I am pleased to note that this year the United Nations is looking at expanding its presence in the Pacific region. Such an approach strengthens United Nations relations with its Members. In that regard  Solomon Islands looks forward to the proposed upgrading of the UNDP sub-office in Honiara to the country level.  Solomon Islands notes that the first part of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document features rural and agricultural development. My delegation is heartened by a proposed joint UNDP/United Nations Capital Development Fund project for the strengthening of the Solomon Islands provincial government system and for investing in provincial infrastructure and communications. The project has the merit of strengthening all democratic principles and bringing the State closer to its people. My Government stands ready to assist such a worthwhile project in any way it can. Solomon Islands calls on all partners to contribute to it and to better the lives of a people whose needs have been neglected for so long.  Solomon Islands follows developments in the Middle East with concern  in particular in Iraq  Lebanon and Palestine. It is sad to see parents burying sons in a conflict that claims the lives of more children than soldiers. Solomon Islands associates itself with   3 06-53323  the observation of the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs  Jan Egeland  that something is truly wrong. Under such difficult circumstances  we must find the strength to trust one another and work tirelessly to find a permanent  sustainable and lasting solution to the crisis. The world looks to this Organization for a solution  and we must not fail it. That can only be done if we are prepared to take a holistic approach in seeking a permanent solution to the Middle East question  by embracing all parties in the region and working in the spirit of the United Nations Charter and through dialogue and consultation.  On Security Council reform  in the words of our Secretary-General  “no reform of the United Nations will be complete without the reform of the Security Council” (A/61/1  para. 161). The time is ripe to balance ongoing reforms with Security Council reform. The Council’s failure to act — for various political reasons — to contain certain conflicts calls into question its effectiveness  given its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The most vulnerable Members of the Organization do not have the luxury of waiting  because conflicts and potential conflicts may take root. More than 5 billion dollars has already been spent on United Nations peacekeeping missions — money that would be better spent on development.  Only by enlarging the Council and arming it with improved working methods can we make it truly representative and accountable to the wider membership of this Organization. Solomon Islands would like to see countries such as Japan and Germany as permanent members  together with emerging Powers such as India and Brazil.  On the question of the representation of Taiwan  the continuous refusal by this Organization over the past 13 years to discuss the representation of the 23 million people of Taiwan at the United Nations is a matter of serious concern. This creates an institutional gap in an Organization where we are all supposed to stand equal. My delegation wishes to register its disappointment at the fact that its right even to discuss the issue was denied last week. Solomon Islands feels that the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter continue to be violated in this respect. The time has come for this institution to act according to the rules that guide the behaviour and conduct of Members and to have an honest debate on the issue. Solomon Islands renews its call on the United Nations to recognize the right of the 23 million people of Taiwan to be represented at the United Nations. Solomon Islands is also concerned about security threats on the Taiwan Strait. My delegation calls on all Member States to distinguish our collective interests to preserve peace from narrow interests that threaten peace. Solomon Islands further calls on the United Nations  the body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security  to mediate and engage with the People’s Republic of China  Taiwan and other stakeholders in finding a permanent solution to this issue.  This year we will be electing a new Secretary-General. Solomon Islands  a member of the Asian Group  would like to see a Secretary-General who has an interest in our subregion. For the last 28 years  since Solomon Islands joined this noble institution  no Secretary-General has ever visited my part of the world. We would like to see our future Secretary-General engage more closely with Member States on the other side of the globe.  On the subject of terrorism  Solomon Islands once again reiterates its condemnation of all forms of terrorism  in whatever form and manifestation  wherever and whenever it may occur. Recent attacks in India and in various parts of the world underscore the fact that terrorism remains a threat to all. Solomon Islands looks forward to an early conclusion of the comprehensive terrorism convention and is pleased that talks between the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee and Member States  including those in the Pacific region  have begun. It is our hope that the consultations will address the gaps in national mechanisms and  where possible  have a regional approach to the issues. I am pleased to report that  with the assistance of New Zealand  Solomon Islands expects to fulfil some of its counter- terrorism reporting obligations during the course of 2007.  Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  At last year’s World Summit  170 of our Heads of State and Government agreed to ensure the fuller participation of developing countries  in particular the least developed countries  in the global system. The lack of agreement at the Doha Round continues to hurt small island open-market economies  such as that of Solomon Islands. We hope that enough political will can be garnered to confront existing differences and    06-53323 4  ensure that a universal  rules-based  open  non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system is established.  Solomon Islands continues to benefit from North-South cooperation to sustain its growth. We must also continue to work on enhancing South-South cooperation. I am pleased to note that developing countries  such as Papua New Guinea  have provided needed assistance in education and security. My Government is paying closer attention to renewable sources of energy with the help of India  Taiwan and Indonesia. It is our hope that  with the cooperation of all our partners  appropriate technologies will be transferred  so that communities can have access to modern and affordable energy. In this connection  the Global Environment Fund and the United Nations Environment Programme could look at facilitating such initiatives. Solomon Islands would like to thank India  Taiwan  Indonesia  China and the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs for enabling experts from the Pacific Islands to meet and work on such programmes.  A number of developmental opportunities have emerged since the 2005 World Summit meeting. Among other things  a HIV/AIDS declaration has been adopted. Solomon Islands would like to see the Global Fund to Fight Aids  Tuberculosis and Malaria provide a complete package for the Pacific region  ranging from awareness to treatment. It is cheaper to invest in a problem that is small than to treat a full-blown pandemic. Solomon Islands would like the Global Fund to reconsider the Pacific regional project submitted during the sixtieth session.  Solomon Islands notes with regret that the recent five-year review conference of the 2001 Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects did not agree on a final document. Solomon Islands continues to believe that the root cause of the emerging gun culture is development-related. At some stage  such conferences should focus more on addressing poverty issues within vulnerable countries  where gun culture is likely to emerge  in a global effort to address the issue once and for all.  On the issue of international migration  which was taken up at last week’s High-level Meeting  Solomon Islands  together with its regional neighbours  continues to seek opportunities to manage short-term labour migration within its subregion and globally. While nothing concrete has emerged  the regional discussion has allowed us to better understand the receiving States’ position and  hopefully  will allow us to work towards striking an agreed balance. Solomon Islands feels that the pull factor from the South to the North is natural and serves as a win-win factor for the South that provides needed labour for the North’s growing economies  while at the same time benefiting the South financially.  The United Nations offers opportunities for Member States to become responsible global citizens. Solomon Islands would like to see mission recruitment procedures at country level. We are also seriously looking at participating in selected United Nations civilian police missions.  Finally  a reformed and strengthened United Nations represents our best hope for a better future. Solomon Islands reiterates its commitment to work within the framework of international cooperation to address today’s economic  social  cultural and humanitarian challenges. "
"154",6270,"SLE",61,2006,"The delegation of the Republic of Sierra Leone would like to congratulate the President on her assumption of the responsibility for directing the work of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. It is our pleasure to reaffirm our confidence in her ability to run the Assembly  as well as to pledge our unflinching support and cooperation during her tenure.  Let me also take this opportunity to pay special tribute to her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his commitment and diplomatic skill  which enabled him effectively to manage the Assembly and help the reform process to achieve some major successes during his presidency.   A year ago  the heads of Member States of the United Nations declared their commitment to the reform of the Organization  in order to reflect its experience in the course of 60 years of existence and its ever-expanding role within the context of the realities of the current world order. The process has  understandably  been painfully slow  because of the multiplicity of competing national interests. While my delegation appreciates the progress made so far  particularly in the form of the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  we are unhappy about the sluggish pace of Security Council reform  a matter that is close to the heart of Africa.   As a Member State deeply committed to the African position on United Nations reform  my delegation would like to urge the reform of the Security Council to move faster so that our continent can take its rightful place in the United Nations organ that is responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security. Obviously  the Security Council can never be the just  democratic and representative body that it should be if Africa  with 53 Member States in the United Nations  does not have permanent representation proportional to its size.  As a least developed country (LDC) emerging from a devastating conflict  we are also concerned that development has not been treated with the prominence and urgency it deserves in the reform process  considering its cause-and-effect relationship with conflict and human rights. That relationship was succinctly recognized in one of the outcomes of last year’s High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly  which stated that our nations and peoples could not enjoy development without security  nor would they enjoy security in the absence of development  and they would not enjoy either without respect for human rights. The need  therefore  to support development programmes — including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development — as the foundation for peace and security cannot be overemphasized.  We are particularly happy about the establishment of the Human Rights Council  whose operation  we hope  will be above the weaknesses that demoralized the former Human Rights Commission. We call on all Member States  in particular the Council’s founding members  to set and maintain standards that will justify the optimism that the new Council will refrain from practices that discredited the Human Rights Commission.  Of particular interest to us as a post-conflict country  however  is the Peacebuilding Commission  whose mandate is to support the recovery of societies emerging from conflict. We thank the Commission for choosing Sierra Leone as one of two countries where it will begin operation. We assure the Commission of our fullest support and cooperation. As it will soon discover  if it has not yet done so  we have already embarked on the path of peacebuilding and consolidation  having carefully formulated policies and activities aimed at achieving lasting peace  security and stability  which are the critical requirements for meaningful development.  We have developed a poverty reduction strategy paper that has attracted support from a number of donor agencies and friendly countries. We have produced a peace-consolidation strategy paper  which is to be presented to the Peacebuilding Commission for support in addressing some of the challenges facing our country in the areas of governance and security prior to the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007.  For the Peacebuilding Commission to be able to work in Sierra Leone on the basis of concrete  first-hand information  we have extended an invitation to the Commission to visit Sierra Leone. We are looking forward to receiving the Commission in Sierra Leone.  The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone completed its peacekeeping mandate and closed down at the end of 2005. But the United Nations did not    06-53005 24  leave behind a complete vacuum  it left the United Nations Integrated Office for Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) to support our post-conflict recovery programme. We thank the United Nations for its continued support and assure the Organization that its contribution will not be in vain. We have no doubt that the combined efforts of the Peacebuilding Commission  UNIOSIL and the Government will achieve the desired objective of peace  security and development in the country.  The people of Sierra Leone are proud of their role in resolving their own conflict  as well as of their successes in the democratic process. We had a highly successful democratic election in 2002  barely five months after the end of the conflict. That was followed by local government elections as part of a governance decentralization process. Our second post-conflict presidential and parliamentary elections  which will mark a transition in leadership  are scheduled to be held around this time next year. Sierra Leone cannot afford having that watershed election go wrong  but we need assistance to carry it out properly. I therefore appeal to the United Nations  the European Union  other members of the international community and our bilateral friends to continue to help us  both financially and technically  to make the elections another milestone achievement in Sierra Leone’s peace and democracy processes.  The people of Sierra Leone are conscious of the fact that the peace they now enjoy is a product of the support of  and cooperation with  the United Nations and the international community. At this stage in our history  the country is faced with three sets of challenges as a nation: we must rectify the accumulated errors of past policies; we must repair the damage and heal the scars left by the conflict; and we must chart an appropriate path for the development of our small country in the twenty-first century. We have the natural resources to be able to do that. With time  our human resources will also measure up. Above all  at this time we need the sustained engagement of international partners. That is why we are seeking to expand and reinforce our partnerships with the external world — partnerships that can support us now  and remain with us as we pursue a longer-term agenda for sustainable development.  Finally  we are in a conflict-ridden region and the peace in Sierra Leone cannot be sustained in isolation. We therefore urge the United Nations to continue its efforts to pursue durable peace in the West African subregion. "
"155",6317,"SLV",61,2006,"We wish to congratulate Ms. Al-Khalifa for her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  with the certainty that her distinguished personal and professional qualities will ensure the optimum performance of the work on the agenda. This also represents recognition of the necessary participation of women in the reforms of the United Nations. I also wish to extend our special recognition to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his resolute efforts and dedication to international peace and security  stability  human rights and development  in addition to his appreciable contribution to the reform of the Organization.  The international community currently has challenges that require our immediate attention. At the present time  there are more than sixteen armed-conflicts in the world where the United Nations participates in peacekeeping operations. El Salvador is present at some of these operations  concretely demonstrating our belief in an international system of law  and in an international organization capable of resolving such conflicts that seriously threaten our stability.  The situation of instability has an indescribable impact in terms of the loss of human life  the destruction of infrastructure  refugees  displaced persons and the shortage of resources needed for life. This impacts the affected regions  as well as the political  economic and humanitarian condition of the entire international community.  I have come to this rostrum to speak out in favour of peace and security in the Middle East  as well as dialogue and understanding  so that we can find timely and sustainable political and diplomatic solutions that support our belief in the right of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples to live in peace within secure and internationally recognized borders.  We welcome adoption of resolution 1697 (2006) on 31 July and resolution 1701 (2006) on 11 August by the Security Council and call for compliance with those resolutions as they make possible a cessation of hostilities. This should represent the beginning of a new phase in finding a negotiated political solution to the conflict in Lebanon and in the Middle East.  We are fully convinced that one of the keys to progress towards peace in the Middle East is the disarmament of all armed groups operating outside the law and Government control in the region  as well as the exercise by Governments of full sovereignty over their territories. Here  we believe that it is essential for the United Nations  in particular the Security Council  to continue to play a proactive and decisive role in finding a lasting  comprehensive and sustainable solution in the Middle East and to redirect the peace process.  After a careful analysis of the international situation  and of the Middle East in particular  my Government made the decision to move its ambassador from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. We hope that this will make a contribution to promoting the peace process in the region and serve as an expression of our commitment and respect for compliance with United Nations resolutions.  We do hope that this decision  in addition to making a concrete contribution to peace in the Middle East  will also help to strengthen friendship and understanding between my country and Israel. We also wish to express our feelings of solidarity and friendship to the Palestinian people. They can rely on El Salvador to continue to seek peace  security and well-being for the Palestinian people.  Terrorism is a real and merciless threat against humanity. Accordingly  I wish to reaffirm our vigorous condemnation of all acts of terrorism in all their forms and manifestations  wherever or by whomever they are committed  irrespective of the objective sought.  Today  more than ever  it is essential to strengthen and expand international cooperation to combat this scourge  within the framework of the rule of law  human rights and international humanitarian law. The    06-52737 28  United Nations has a historic opportunity to combat international terrorism through the recently adopted Global Strategy against Terrorism. The threat of terrorism is a daily reality  but the opportunity to deal with it is in our hands. Let us do what we need to do to implement this strategy and strengthen international cooperation in combating terrorism.  El Salvador supports and participates actively in attaining these objectives. We continue to promote such action at the national level and hope that our legislative assembly will adopt a law against terrorism in the next few days.  Given the situation of the world as described  we would like to take this opportunity to add our voices to the call of the international community regarding the celebration of the International Day of Peace  set by the General Assembly on 21 September each year. The Assembly issued a firm appeal that during that Day all parties in conflict  wherever they might be  cease their fighting and observe a global ceasefire  leading to reflection about the adverse effects of war and the benefits of peace.  One of the most serious threats to peace  social stability  the security of citizens and economic development is the problem of organized crime. El Salvador  together with other countries in Central America  has been particularly affected by this problem in recent years. The expansion of the criminal activities of bands and gangs that act not only within countries  but also beyond borders. They have become criminal organizations that not only commit individual and group murder  but also engage in extortion and terrorist acts related to transnational crime. They have furthermore become involved in the trafficking of arms and drugs  human trafficking and money-laundering.  El Salvador is aware of the dimensions of the problem and its impact on society. For this reason  we are one of the main countries promoting a comprehensive approach. Not only do we directly combat these groups  but we also use preventive methods  namely  rehabilitation and social reintegration. We are convinced that this task cannot be dealt with individually. What is needed is collective action and international coordination and cooperation.  In this connection  we believe that this Organization should consider the adoption of measures and mechanisms consistent with the instruments and protocols that deal with organized crime  so that we can achieve a broad international consensus aimed at coping more effectively with this evil that  increasingly  is threatening society in general. Moreover  we should develop policies and cooperation to this end. I would mention  in particular  programmes for young people in high-risk situations or who are at odds with the law in our countries.  Speaking of the reform of the United Nations means talking about the suitability and relevance of an international organization could respond adequately to the opportunities and challenges of today’s world.  We believe that it is particularly important to break this stalemate in negotiations and settle as soon as possible the question of expanding the membership of the Security Council  both permanent and non-permanent members  so that it can be more representative with respect to the current number of States that are Members of this Organization. For my Government  this is a subject that is extremely important. Therefore  it is essential to make this important body more representative  to give it greater transparency  to make it more democratic and legitimate  particularly in the decision-making process for important decisions.  Also  recognition should be given to some of the reforms adopted  and we welcome the beginning of work of the new Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  of which El Salvador is honoured and appreciative of being a part. Here  I wish to reaffirm the commitment of the Government of El Salvador to respect and protect human rights  while we make available to the Peacebuilding Commission the experience gained by El Salvador in its successful peace process. This would initially apply to some countries  such as Burundi and Sierra Leone  that are now being considered with regard to which the Commission will be able to provide advice to the Security Council.  In the life of nations there are always special questions that determine direction and destiny as they move towards their future. The question of the Republic of China in Taiwan is one of those questions. Even though it is a political reality that has evolved in parallel with other States and embodies all of the characteristics needed to be a State  there is still failure to recognize its existence. This denies the right of 23 million people of Taiwan to be represented in international organizations and  in particular  the   29 06-52737  United Nations. We firmly believe that the situation of Taiwan should be examined pragmatically in the light of the current political reality. The United Nations is the proper forum to do so — not only because it should recognize the right of the Taiwanese people to be represented  but also because a globalized world should not allow exclusion or marginalization from international cooperation. Such cooperation strengthens efforts to combat challenges and problems that are common to all and could undermine the quality of life and obstruct the development of peoples. Here  we reiterate the need to open up room for the representation and participation of Taiwan in the United Nations  particularly in the specialized agencies  which by their nature are related to humanitarian  economic and social questions.  The President returned to the Chair.  A subject of special interest for El Salvador is the strengthening of international cooperation for development  particularly with a view to complying with the Millennium Development Goals. In this connection  we believe that  in order to implement and follow up on our development plans  we must have the support of the international community so as to create fairer and more open conditions that would enable us to accede to technological resources  the transfer of technology  environmentally friendly technology  the support for the generation of technical capabilities and new financial resources in favourable conditions. El Salvador is firmly committed to attaining the Millennium Development Goals  as envisaged in our Government plan  and accordingly  we have made efforts and directed resources  primarily through national impact programmes  together with international cooperation  with special focus on education and health.  Even though we agree that every country must assume fundamental responsibility for its own development  the developed States should contribute to creating the opportunities needed to enable the relatively less developed countries to reduce the political and economic impact of the social deficit  through the implementation of measures that will enable us to enjoy the benefits of free trade  economic globalization and international cooperation and increase our technical capacity and productivity. This must include the commitment to give 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product as official aid to development. We recognize and express our appreciation to the countries that have already done so.  In this perspective  we have warmly welcomed the adoption of the General Assembly resolution on the follow-up to the results of the 2005 World Summit on development. It is of great importance if we are fully to comply with the Millennium Development Goals that we have set ourselves. We firmly believe that low-income countries and middle-income countries should not be excluded from international cooperation and technical and financial assistance  whether bilateral or multilateral  particularly those countries that have maintained good responsible management of resources obtained through international cooperation and public finance. However  despite the progress achieved in improving the quality of life of our peoples  there are still groups of populations that suffer from extreme poverty and require cooperation and international assistance to supplement the efforts we are making to attain those objectives.  This could not be otherwise  given the fact that middle- and low-income countries continue to face challenges in the development process. Therefore  we would like to make a resounding appeal to the developed countries  the middle-income countries and the multilateral financial agencies to become real partners and strategic allies  so that we can overcome our problems and help us to promote the agenda for development and progress for our peoples.  In this respect  I am pleased to announce that El Salvador is planning to hold a forum next year of low-income countries where we hope to unify criteria and positions on this subject  in addition to considering the strengthening of cooperation and technical  scientific and financial assistance among participating countries. On this occasion  we cordially invite middle- and low-income countries  together with donor countries and development agencies  to participate in this meeting. We hope that their participation and contributions will enrich our analysis and will benefit the middle- and low-income countries  which are frequently excluded from development funds.  My Government attaches great priority to the Agenda for Development  particularly to expand coverage of basic services and generate opportunities for productivity in those areas and communities where  because of their poverty indicators and their growth    06-52737 30  potential  we have felt that they deserve strategic attention.  My country has been recognized for having adopted a series of measures to strengthen democratic institutions  economic freedoms and social investment. This has gained us the confidence of the international community  which we believe is indispensable for establishing an environment conducive to mobilizing alternative sources of funding that can make possible social programmes aimed at reducing poverty.  From the beginning of our term in office  we have done much to seek innovative forms of cooperation  such as those offered by various millennium funds. We have applied for Millennium Challenge Account financing for a country programme based on national dialogue and with the participation of our citizens. It will be an integrated  comprehensive strategy directly benefiting more than 850 000 inhabitants of 92 municipalities in northern El Salvador  thus contributing reducing poverty in that region.  No less important and closely complementary  we believe that international cooperation based on solidarity encompasses the swapping of debt for social programmes. We welcome the proposals and decisions of some developed countries  which are supporting such mechanisms  especially in health and education  thereby encouraging countries that have honoured their foreign debt obligations. There is no doubt that these activities strengthen democracy and freedom.  We feel that despite the decline in oil prices  continued high prices are not only detrimental to the efforts of developing countries to improve and strengthen our economies  because they make exports and imports more expensive  reduce income and create inflation. They also have a negative impact on chain of production  and on basic necessities and services  opening the way to the possibility of a worldwide recession  which clearly would have political and social repercussions. We feel that oil should not be used as a tool to achieve goals of any kind  but rather as a means to strengthen the global economy in general. It is important to define rules for creating a more stable oil market and at the same time to enhance our efforts to find alternative sources of energy that are accessible and environmentally friendly.  For El Salvador  migration is one of the priorities on our domestic and international agenda. We have decided to create  for the first time in the history of El Salvador  the post of Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs for Salvadorans Living Abroad  a high-level Government position within the Foreign Ministry  whose main function is to serve emigrants through a comprehensive  multidimensional policy. The vice-ministry is operating successfully. Salvadorans living abroad are on the presidential agenda. Last week  the Assembly held a High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development. El Salvador participated proactively and chaired one of the round tables. I am thankful for the confidence placed in us.  Allow me to reaffirm what was expressed by the Foreign Minister of El Salvador at the High-level Dialogue. We stress the importance of this issue and the need to continue discussions from a broad-based and positive perspective  which gives us a comprehensive view and a higher level of understanding of the issue of migration as an international social fact. Migration gives rise to a dynamic and complex process involving various aspects including flows of individuals  capital  goods and services. It involves rights and obligations  organization  assistance  cooperation  legal and legislative processes  analysis  studies and research on this issue  and subsequent oversight by the United Nations system  as a complement to domestic  subregional and continental efforts.  I welcome the outcome of the Dialogue and express the hope that the United Nations will give the issue of migration human  just and balanced consideration.  On 16 January 2007  we will celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the signing of the peace accords for El Salvador. Fifteen years ago  Salvadorans were fully convinced that we were worthy of a better future and deserved a rebuilt  democratic country  a country of reconciliation and freedom for us and for our children. We can now be proud of our endeavours to genuinely fulfil the commitments made at Chapultepec  whose spirit should prevail as we continue to strengthen democratic institutions in my country.  I would like to pay public tribute to the entire people of El Salvador for their dedication to the cause of peace and national reconciliation. I would also like to acknowledge the men and women who signed the peace accords  whose historic action was the basis for our present and future as a nation. Likewise  I would   31 06-52737  like to pay a special tribute to the United Nations for its work and for its effective mediation  which led to the completion in 2003 of its work to monitor the peace accords  and to the countries of the Group of Friends of El Salvador for their important support for the successful completion of the peace process.  Today  the United Nations — an Organization created to promote and realize universal principles and ideals that are still valid in our contemporary world  especially the ideal of promoting progress for the millions of persons throughout the world who struggle daily to secure their basic rights  dignity and importance as human beings — has a choice: either to ossify and become anachronic  or to modernize and become an Organization that can deal more efficiently and effectively with the challenges of the twenty-first century in a complex  globalized and interdependent world.  It is clear that we all wish for a modern and viable Organization to meet the challenges together  but Member States will decide whether the Organization changes to fulfil its mandate  especially to maintain international peace and security and promote respect for human rights and economic and social development.  Thus  it will depend on us whether the present and the future of the today’s world will be based on diplomacy or will be condemned to use force to resolve differences in international relations. This is the serious dilemma that we must resolve. The task is complex because of its size and ramifications  due in turn to its diversity in the face of the phenomena of power and the exercise of power. We hold the hope that reason and conscience will prevail over force and domination — for the benefit of all humanity. "
"156",6342,"SMR",61,2006,"On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of San Marino  I wish to congratulate Her Excellency Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am confident that her abilities and expertise will be key to the success of this session. Along with my satisfaction on the election to such a high position of a woman after so many years  I add my best wishes.  I also wish to thank the outgoing President  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his valuable work and total commitment and resolve in implementing the reform programme started by the Secretary-General.  The Republic of San Marino firmly believes that the role of the United Nations needs strengthening in order to enable the Organization to operate as efficiently as possible and with optimal coordination among its bodies. With special reference to the General Assembly  the most important decision-making body of the United Nations  San Marino believes that it should focus more closely on the actual implementation of its resolutions and create mechanisms to make its decisions more binding.  For the small and medium-sized countries that represent the majority of the Member States  the revitalization of the General Assembly — the main and sometimes only forum in which they can make their voice heard — is essential. Indeed  the General Assembly is the organ that fully implements the principles of democracy and equal representation upon which this Organization is founded.  There is no doubt that Security Council reform is the other major objective of the United Nations. San Marino believes that it is necessary to resume dialogue. In our opinion  the new Security Council should be    06-53341 16  founded upon a flexible base so that it can adjust appropriately to future changes. The enlargement and democratization of the Council can only improve peace processes and thereby the defence of the weakest Member States.  San Marino also expresses its deep satisfaction with the new Human Rights Council  which is already fully operational. We hope that there will be a clear division of tasks between the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly in order to avoid duplication and ensure complementarity and efficiency in a balanced relationship and mutual independence.  San Marino followed with great interest the intense negotiations leading to the adoption on 30 June of the resolution on the follow-up to the 2005 World Summit  including the Millennium Development Goals  and fully endorses the call of the President of the Assembly to focus attention at this general debate on setting up a global partnership for development. That goal is a fundamental step towards the eradication of poverty and the achievement of the other Millennium Goals. To do so  however  cooperation at all levels is essential and San Marino is ready to make its own concrete contribution.  The development goals are also the key points of the programme that San Marino will present when it assumes the chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in mid-November. During its chairmanship  which is extremely important to the Republic  San Marino will also address other global issues  such as intercultural and interreligious dialogue.  The Republic of San Marino  in line with its centuries-old history of peace  democracy and freedom  is particularly sensitive to the need  in today’s international context characterized by growing tensions and violent contrasts  to promote dialogue among cultures and religions based on respect for diversity and universally recognized human rights.  In that regard  I wish to reiterate the determination of the Government and institutions of San Marino to guarantee all possible support to the international community for the achievement of those objectives. It is in that spirit that my country has consistently demonstrated its solidarity with the most disadvantaged people and circumstances and has acceded to legal instruments particularly important to the promotion and achievement of international cooperation in the search for dialogue and the affirmation of the principles of tolerance and understanding. Thus  intercultural and interreligious dialogue constitutes the basis of any peace process and the most powerful tool to reject all forms of extremism  which unfortunately  as we know  often turns into terrorism.  During our chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers  to begin in November  I will seek to organize a meeting with the Assembly on that important subject.  In that context  we cannot but think of the Middle East  in particular the situation in Lebanon  where the United Nations is committed to a new difficult peace mission  which we sincerely hope will have a successful outcome. Only a year ago  San Marino expressed from this rostrum its confidence and hope in the peace process and in the good will of the parties involved in the protracted conflict. After a series of violent attacks  mostly against civilians and innocent people  as always  the only achievement so far has been an unstable ceasefire. To help alleviate that suffering  San Marino has decided  in line with its centuries-old tradition of solidarity  to offer a special contribution for humanitarian aid in Lebanon.  San Marino has welcomed with great satisfaction the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission as the ideal institutional response to post-conflict situations. The history of my country is deeply rooted in the values of peaceful coexistence among all peoples  and the newly elected Government has decided to include in its programme  for the first time  a specific mandate for peace. The objective is to promote  also in collaboration with volunteer associations and by supporting international cooperation  any useful initiative to affirm and safeguard that important objective.  Therefore  the institutions of San Marino  in response to the United Nations appeal  decided to celebrate the International Day of Peace on 21 September. That occasion was also marked by the opening of a public subscription to raise funds for the victims of conflicts to be devolved to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  My country will guarantee its active support for the Pan-European Campaign on Violence against Women  in particular domestic violence  which will be launched during San Marino’s chairmanship of the   17 06-53341  Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe  in parallel with the celebration of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Moreover  it will strongly support the development of the Council of Europe programme “Building a Europe for and with Children”.  Another particularly important occasion will be the participation of San Marino in the United Nations Global Youth Leadership Summit  which will examine the contribution of young people to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  with particular reference to sport  development and peace  and will provide the youth organizations with the necessary guidelines for future action.  San Marino greatly appreciates the successful outcome of the work of the group established to draft an international convention on the protection of persons with disabilities. Indeed  my country is becoming increasingly aware of and attentive to the problems and rights of disabled people. In this regard  only two weeks ago  the San Marino Parliament approved an agenda inviting the Government to sign and ratify the Convention as soon as possible and to take measures in support of the principles contained therein.  Let me underscore how  despite all the difficulties and divisions  the United Nations still demonstrates its ability to put in place all initiatives and activities which are at the core of its very existence. It is  therefore  a duty for all States to keep alive the flame of ideals and the determination that constitute the foundations of the Organization’s identity and  at the same time  the crucial point of reference for all of our actions  both at the national level and also in terms of international cooperation.  Prompted by this conviction  and strongly committed to guaranteeing a constant and constructive contribution  we would like to express our best wishes to the President  to the Secretary-General — to whom we reiterate our most sincere appreciation and highest esteem for his dedicated commitment during these years at the helm of the United Nations — and to all colleagues and representatives who share the same conviction.

"157",6379,"SOM",61,2006,"It gives me great pleasure to know that a sister from fraternal Bahrain is presiding over this important session of the General Assembly. Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa’s leadership will certainly contribute to promoting dialogue and harmony in the midst of the spread of conflicts throughout the different corners of the world. We are confident that she will successfully guide the deliberations of the Assembly.  Let me also take this opportunity to pay special tribute to her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his commitment and diplomatic skill  which enabled him to effectively manage the deliberations of the Assembly. We likewise wish to recognize Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the immense efforts undertaken and the commendable services rendered during his tenure in promoting the maintenance of peace and security and international cooperation.  I wish at the outset to brief this Assembly in some detail on the current situation in Somalia. The establishment of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia was the result of the successful peace and reconciliation process held in Nairobi  Kenya in 2004  and created a unique opportunity for ending the Somali political crisis. The Somali people were overjoyed that a comprehensive settlement of the conflict had finally been reached.  The advancement and consolidation of peace and stability requires the unwavering commitment of the international community to reinforce the Transitional Federal Government’s national efforts in nation-building. Regrettably  owing to circumstances not fully understood by us  the international community failed to act in a timely fashion to support the new Government in facing the enormous challenges it confronted. Consequently  a window of opportunity has been lost  which has led to continued violence and conflict.  Ironically  the international community’s failure to act also paved the way for the warlords and other armed groups to take advantage of a political vacuum  as they asserted and consolidated their power and clan-based authority in the capital city  Mogadishu  and its environs.  Although they had the privilege of holding important ministerial portfolios in the new Government  the warlords pursued their hidden agenda to promote their personal interests and political ambitions by maintaining the chaotic status quo in Somalia.  It is noteworthy to bear in mind that the warlords and the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) had initially combined their forces and political rhetoric as an opposition alliance group against the Transitional Federal Government. Both groups were encouraged by the reluctance of the international community to come quickly to the aid of the new Somali Government and by the continuation of the United Nations arms embargo against Somalia. However  the ICU soon realized that the warlords were losing popularity among mainstream Somalis.  At this juncture  the Transitional Federal Government  though sceptical  responded positively to the initiative undertaken by the League of Arab States to convene peace talks and settle the differences between the parties. The first and second rounds of those peace talks have successfully taken place in Khartoum  and both sides have agreed on general principles and some preliminary issues for the next round of talks scheduled to be held in Khartoum in October 2006.   However  as the Islamic Courts Union continued to rush to consolidate their grip  their concealed intentions are fast becoming evident to the Somali people and to the international community. In this connection  it will be recalled that the ICU continued with impunity to expand and attack other districts outside Mogadishu including Jowhar  Balad  and other adjacent areas. The latest development of the ICU’s territorial expansion was the ill-advised armed attack and seizure of the city of Kismayo  in flagrant violation of the Khartoum Peace Agreement.   29 06-53615   It should also be noted that the President of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia  Mr. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed  survived a targeted assassination attempt on 18 September 2006. My Government firmly believes that this heinous crime is an act of terrorism aimed at undermining and sabotaging the peace process in Somalia and should be condemned in the strongest terms. This heinous attack resulted in the death of several people  including the brother of the President. We wish to express our appreciation to all those delegations and organizations that expressed their sympathy and condemned this act.   These developments are all disquieting and disturbing  and the situation is deteriorating to an alarming degree and at a rapid pace. It continues to pose a serious threat to the peace that has been achieved  which has serious implications for the security and stability of the region.   Despite all these violations of the Peace Agreement  the Transitional Federal Government remains committed to the path of dialogue and negotiation with the ICU and relevant civil society organizations. But this positive attitude will not continue if the ICU persists in its aggressive policies of attacks and territorial expansion.  As I stated earlier  the absence of law and order  the escalation of violence and the ensuing collapse of central authority were the major causes for the chaos and anarchy in Somalia. The main goal of the Transitional Federal Government is therefore to engage in an effective  focused plan for the re-establishment of institutions for peace and good governance in order to restore normalcy and stability in the country. We therefore strongly appeal to the international community to demonstrate a political will and a commitment to redouble its efforts to provide political  financial and technical support to the Transitional Federal Government during this challenging transitional period.  It goes without saying that the absence of effective  functioning government institutions capable of enforcing law and order has been the underlying cause of the Somali conflict for the past 14 years. At this crucial juncture  what Somalia urgently needs is immediate and substantial support for the creation of an environment conducive to peace and security which in essence is the key requirement for reconstruction and economic recovery.  The economic challenges facing the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia are formidable. The collapse of the Somali State in 1991 resulted in extensive destruction of governing and management institutions which are now being re-established by the Transitional Federal Government in its post-conflict reconstruction programmes.  It is deeply disturbing to note that over half a million children under the age of five die each year from preventable diseases  malaria being the biggest killer. Moreover  over 100 000 women die each year from complications in pregnancy and childbirth. Despite all these hardships  the Transitional Federal Government’s economic and social recovery programmes have received virtually no assistance from international donors and certainly none commensurate with the massive needs of the Somali people. For far too long  Somalia was allowed to struggle alone and the negative consequences have been monumental.   Somalia can aspire to establish the sufficient conditions for sustained economic growth by leveraging its energetic human and social capital. However  a successful and sustainable reconstruction and development programme requires the international community’s support of the Transitional Federal Government’s determined efforts to wield administrative authority and develop competence at the federal  regional and district levels. This situation calls for a broad-based participatory partnership approach from the family of nations and for the provision of technical assistance in the building of efficient institutions that leverage the resiliency and potential of the Somali people.  In terms of required relief assistance  it is to be noted that approximately 1.8 million Somalis are still in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and livelihood support. In view of the magnitude of this challenge  my delegation appeals to the world body and the donor community to respond positively  generously and  above all  concertedly in order to meet Somalia’s humanitarian needs and avert a catastrophe of major proportions.  In an effort to stabilize Somalia and overcome the sources of insecurity  the Government has put in place a well-marshalled National Security and Stabilization Plan. Both in concept and execution  the plan takes a holistic approach to the nature and scope of insecurity in the country. For its implementation  the plan takes    06-53615 30  into consideration local  regional and international dimensions. Accordingly  it envisions the combined and concerted local  regional and international efforts in its execution. However  the realization of this plan remains elusive insofar as the Government is fragile and incapable of enforcing the policies and laws of the land pursuant to the Transitional Federal Charter.  The Transitional Federal Government welcomes all efforts now being undertaken by the international community in addressing the new problems and realities of Somalia. It is important to note that the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union have now finalized the details and salient elements of the IGAD Peace Support Mission in Somalia. At the international level  it is also gratifying that the International Contact Group on Somalia  which was recently established  convened its second meeting in Brussels to find ways and means to streamline the international engagement and support for Somalia. Moreover  on its part  the United Nations Security Council is in the process of considering Somalia’s security problems  in particular the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo and the deployment of IGASOM to Somalia.  All these combined activities at the regional and international levels demonstrate the heightened interest and attention given to Somalia. However  it remains to be seen whether all these initiatives can be properly coordinated and directed towards substantially assisting the Transitional Federal Government in its daunting task of stabilizing the country. To be meaningful and effective  the contributions of the international community must focus  as a matter of priority  on the fundamental issue of capacity-building for the Transitional Federal Government institutions  particularly in the security sector.   It is imperative that the following specific measures be taken as a matter of urgency:  First  the United Nations arms embargo must be favourably reviewed and lifted by the Security Council. Secondly  the IGAD Peace Support Mission should be deployed as mandated by the African Union and IGAD. Thirdly  the National Security Forces must be institutionalized  trained and equipped. Fourthly  the Demobilization  Disarmament and Reintegration Programme must be undertaken throughout Somalia.  It is also of paramount importance that a solid basis for the Somali public administration be established and that a modest and lean civil service be recruited and trained for the various public sector organs of the State. Regional administrations should be put in place and federal restructuring drawn and implemented in conformity with the Transitional Federal Charter. Finally  immediate efforts should be exerted for the drafting of the permanent federal constitution of Somalia so as to pave the way for free and fair elections after the completion of the transitional period.  These proposals are aimed at restoring peace and stability in order to assist the Transitional Federal Government in establishing functioning and effective institutions capable of providing essential basic services to the people. Failure to do so would once again relegate Somalia to yet another cycle of violence and anarchy.  We share the desire expressed by many delegations in this forum to see the United Nations reinvigorate its role and strengthen its capabilities with a view to becoming more active and effective. It could then guarantee the fulfilment of the objectives and principles that are enshrined in the Charter  so as to ensure that peace on earth and international cooperation will continue to prevail for the welfare of mankind.

"158",6417,"STP",61,2006,"As I have just been re-elected  this is my first opportunity to speak to this forum at the beginning of my second term. It is therefore with great pleasure that I am here today for this sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  Please allow me to congratulate Mrs. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election as the new President of the General Assembly. We are fortunate to have as our President a diplomat with such magnificent credentials. In addition  this is a milestone for the United Nations which makes us all proud. My country  Sao Tome and Principe  is a firm believer in gender equality. I am proud to say that we have a very high percentage of girls in our schools. A woman has held the presidency of our National Assembly  and the current head of our Supreme Court is a woman. We have had two female Prime Ministers  and today women head half of our Government ministries. We are therefore delighted by her election and wish her every success.  I thank also the outgoing President  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his remarkable work  especially in the area of advancing reform of the United Nations. Words are insufficient to pay tribute to outgoing Secretary-General Kofi Annan. A very special son of Africa  he has been an extraordinary leader of our Organization. He has worked unceasingly  showing enormous vision and great courage. No challenge has been too large or too dangerous. My country and I owe a special debt of gratitude to the Secretary-General  whose intervention   27 06-52885  during a 2003 coup attempt helped preserve democracy in Sao Tome and Principe. My people and I thank him. We can only hope that his successor will prove as praiseworthy as he.  We are meeting here today at a time of growing international tension and of increased terrorist attacks on innocent civilians on every continent. We see unending conflicts  even genocide. Never have we needed the United Nations more than at this time  when life as we know it on our planet is threatened by climate change. It is tragic that in the face of all these challenges  the United Nations is often unable to act  because internal politics and a lack of resources constantly hamper its ability to respond as needed.  No country can live in a vacuum in today’s world. For better or for worse  we are together in deciding the fate of our planet. We can no longer be only citizens of our town  our region or our country. We also cannot blindly think that our religion is the only religion  when God created so many  all believing in a Supreme Being but worshiping in different fashions. God also painted us in a rainbow of colours and did not leave instructions for one colour to be in charge of all the others. Nor did He choose a special region or language to rule over everyone else. We must pull together so that no one is left behind. There is enough for everybody  if only we would share. We all could live in freedom and in peace  with work  health  education and dignity  if only we would work together.  While we must work together for certain common goals  we must also respect our cultural differences. One size does not fit all. The practice of democracy in Latin America may not be the same as democracy in Asia. What worked to create economic growth in Europe may not work in Africa. Each country  each people  each region  each town must have the freedom to decide what is best for it  while also respecting the rights of all and everyone’s responsibility as a world citizen.  The HIV/AIDS pandemic is still out of control. In my own tiny  isolated island country  we were long immune from it. Despite desperate efforts at education and prevention  our tiny population is being laid waste by a shocking increase in the number of HIV/AIDS cases. We have only one hospital and a handful of doctors. We are helpless in the face of this crisis  as we cannot afford the antiretrovirals we need for all our sick people  nor do we have the ability to police our maritime borders to keep out the main source of infection. Our women and children are among the millions of other faceless victims around the world  and  without help  we could one day face extinction.  Climate change is already sabotaging many of the efforts being made to achieve sustainable development goals  augmenting poverty in developing countries  especially in the least developed countries and the small island developing States. There is new and strong evidence that most of the warming observed is attributable to human activities. As the polar ice caps melt  my low-lying island country faces a second kind of extinction  that of disappearing beneath the waves of the ocean.  I cannot continue without again asking the Assembly why a country of 23 million people is not represented at the United Nations  where every country is supposed to have one vote. I refer here to Taiwan  an established democracy whose people live in freedom and in peace. Their dynamic and technologically advanced economy is a model for creating wealth in today’s global economy. Taiwan is also an excellent world citizen  generous in humanitarian and development aid.  For centuries  the people of Sao Tome and Principe were debilitated by endemic malaria  and thousands died. Countless attempts to control the mosquitoes carrying that disease failed  until Taiwan brought the necessary know-how and resources to bear. Today cases of malaria have been reduced by 60 per cent. Our doctors and nurses say that there have never been so few cases of malaria in living memory. Thanks to Taiwan and also to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  we are well on our way to finally bringing this scourge under control.  In addition to humanitarian and development aid  Taiwan also maintains productive commercial ties with many United Nations Member countries and is a member of the World Trade Organization  the Asian Development Bank and the Asia Pacific Economic Group. The principle of universality is consecrated in the United Nations Charter. Permanent members of the Security Council should not continue to ignore the case of Taiwan.  Another issue that continues to require the urgent attention of all of us is the embargo on Cuba. This is a relic of the cold war that should be lifted immediately.    06-52885 28   While mentioning the Security Council  I must say that my country supports the calls that have reverberated through these halls for more than a decade. We must reform the Security Council. Its membership and institutional structures reflect outdated geopolitical realities and political thinking that was shaped by the world of 1945. Giving only five permanent members the veto power and special privileges puts the Security Council out of touch with the world. Africa  for example  does not have a single permanent member. This is not acceptable.  I will close by talking about poverty  or rather what we are all seeking  which is the end of poverty. The Millennium Development Goals are a noble project. Sao Tome and Principe is grateful to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Goals’ Director Jeffrey Sachs for their tireless efforts to pull poor countries out of what Professor Sachs so rightly calls the poverty trap.  But how did so many countries get into the poverty trap? We are unlikely to get out  or stay out  unless we know how we got there in the first place. I think it is time we all faced some of the unspoken truths about poverty. Why are we poor? Economists traditionally told us that economic wealth comes from a combination of man-made resources  such as roads  factories  machines  telephone systems; human resources  hard work and education; and technological resources  technical know-how and technological machinery. But if this were true  then poor countries could simply build some schools  pave roads and buy some computers  and we would quickly catch up with rich countries.  But there is something wrong here. While Taiwan  South Korea and China have all been doubling their incomes every decade  many poor countries making these changes are not growing faster than rich countries. In fact  they are growing more slowly  or even getting poorer. So there is a new theory that says the more you have  the faster you grow. This could explain why rich countries stay rich  and poor countries fall farther behind — except that it does not explain how Chile  India  Singapore  Mauritius and Botswana are catching up. These dynamic countries — not Japan  not Switzerland  not the United States — are the fastest-growing economies on the planet. Fifty years ago they were trapped in poverty. That is no longer the case.  Why have so many other countries been left behind? The newest theories tell us that the answer is simple. With or without natural resources  with or without human resources  with or without technology  badly governed countries are poor countries. Bad government causes poverty. When States do not protect property and people; when national revenues benefit self-interested political insiders who oppose any actions that would lead to more equal distribution of income and resources; when Government officials waste funds; when people are hired on the basis of being from the right family or region or political grouping; when nobody monitors Government spending; when corruption is noted but never punished; and when illegal activities are not restrained by law  the press or democratic opposition  then miserable results follow.  We have all heard of the “natural resource curse”  which shows that large amounts of oil or diamonds  for example  tend to make democracy and good government less likely. But recent studies have also found that there is also an “aid curse”. Without meaning to do so  multilateral and bilateral donors can actually make Governments worse. And just as badly governed countries tend to be poor  so badly governed aid projects  without transparency or accountability  also tend to fail.  Humanitarian aid has proven far more successful than long-term development aid  because it is given in highly targeted bursts. It is also usually given as medicine  food  clothing or tents and taken directly to the location of the tragedy  with doctors and nurses on the ground rather than consultants.  Of course  there have been some beautiful successes in aid programmes  mostly in health care  with victories over smallpox  drug-resistant tuberculosis and river blindness. Adult literacy has risen  as had life expectancy until the AIDS pandemic wiped out that improvement.  Aid gives hope to millions of people around the world. We simply need to mend it  not end it. My own country has certainly suffered from its own share of bad governance — for the most part unwittingly  because of our own inexperience. But we are learning quickly in our short history  and we now have one of the most stable and robust democracies in all of Africa.  We have the prospect of oil in our waters and in waters shared with our neighbour  Nigeria. We have   29 06-52885  already taken steps to ensure that any potential petroleum resources are not wasted but are protected for the benefit of all our citizens with an oil revenue management law that was passed unanimously in our parliament in 2004.  We cannot let the past bury the future. We can lift billions out of poverty. When I was first elected President of my country five years ago  I lit a candle of hope for the long-suffering people of Sao Tome and Principe. We are not there yet  but the light is getting brighter.  If development were easy  everyone would already be developed! We cannot sit in supine indifference. Let us renew our efforts and work together with respect  dignity and dedication for the benefit of all the peoples of the world and for the fate of our beautiful planet. "
"159",6458,"SUR",61,2006,"On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Suriname  I should like to take this opportunity to extend to you  Madam  and to the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Bahrain  my sincere congratulations on your election to preside over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session.  We express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  for his contribution to the work of the Organization. I should also like to pledge our support to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  and to pay tribute to him for his leadership  his valuable contribution to the resolution of global challenges and his constructive role in restructuring the United Nations.  In today’s world  guaranteeing necessary infrastructure and ensuring the availability of health services and education for all are still major challenges. The world order continues to deny the vast majority of the members of the international community the opportunity to escape poverty and to utilize their abilities and skills to achieve progress and prosperity. There is a need for enhanced cooperation in areas of relevance to humanity if we are to create an international community that can offer all of its members a fair chance of a decent life.  The call for an enabling international environment for sustainable development and poverty eradication is still a strong one. The international community needs to support the call of the vast majority of its members for fair terms of trade  increased market access for products from the developing countries and a more effective and supportive international financial architecture.  Given the international state of affairs  Suriname supports the implementation of the international global partnership for development. The partnership for development can obtain guidance for its decisions from    06-52737 32  the many commitments adopted at the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic  social and related fields  in particular those reflected in the Millennium Development Goals and the Monterey Consensus. This partnership should aim to energize the political will of all States to implement those commitments and to create genuine opportunities for all States in the field of trade  as well as for investments that promote sustainable development and poverty eradication.  My delegation continues to plead for a rule-based  predictable  non-discriminatory trading and financial system  and for an international system that promotes decent and productive work and extends the benefits of new technology to all parts of the globe.  The focus of the partnership for development must be the establishment of a supportive international environment to achieve  in particular Millennium Development Goal 8 and its targets.  Building a global partnership for development will require the involvement and cooperation of all stakeholders — Governments  the private sector and civil society alike. The partnership should enhance the involvement of the private sector  taking into account the redefinition of the role of the private sector in society  based on a common understanding of the influence of business in spurring development and improving the human condition.  The contribution of the private sector is pivotal to a national policy geared towards enhancing human capital and infrastructure and gaining access to world markets. We note with satisfaction the leadership of the United Nations in this area  and believe that the United Nations Global Compact should collaborate with the partnership for development. Civil society should contribute actively to the partnership for development at all levels  in particular at the national level. Its activities should be in harmony with and complementary to national development efforts.  The challenges we face in the area of international peace and security are equally serious. The increased efforts of the United Nations to save humanity from the scourge of warfare are not always successful. Too often the international community is confronted with situations that seriously jeopardize the safety of individuals and populations.  The Government of Suriname believes that there is a need for us to realize that the United Nations is in fact still our partnership for international peace and security. This partnership should be based on the firm determination of all States to cooperate in seeking fair and lasting solutions to persistent problems that adversely affect international peace and security. Tolerance  mutual respect and mutual interest  leading to the peaceful coexistence of States  good-neighbourliness and unity in diversity  should be the basic principles that guide the recommendations of the partnership for international peace and security.  Recently  the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). This is certainly a step forward towards an effective international response to terrorism  in conformity with international law  international human rights law and international humanitarian law. My delegation notes with satisfaction that the Strategy includes the promotion of dialogue  tolerance and understanding among civilizations. Of equal importance is the recognition that capacity-building in all States is a core element of the global counter-terrorism effort. In this regard  we anticipate a genuine partnership being established to implement the Strategy.  The illegal drugs trade and organized crime also affect international security. Increased cooperation at all levels is needed if the international community is to be able to respond adequately to those threats. In this connection  the Government of Suriname will host an anti-narcotics conference in October 2006. The main purpose of the conference is to enhance coordination and collaboration among participating countries  aimed at combating trafficking in narcotic drugs  dismantling drug-related criminal organizations and combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons  given the increased levels of crime that it generates.  A restructured United Nations must ensure that the Organization remains the source of redress for the international community and the home of international justice and equitable decision-making. Given the less-than-satisfactory international development and security situation  we  the States Members of the United Nations  should be more than willing to act in conformity with the Charter  to employ the international machinery for promoting the economic and social advancement of all peoples  to unite our strengths to maintain international peace and security    33 06-52737  and to practise increased tolerance and live together in peace as good neighbours. Suriname believes that the present session of the General Assembly can contribute significantly to those endeavours. "
"160",6482,"SVK",61,2006,"I would like to express my deepest appreciation and most sincere gratitude to the Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for the invaluable work and tireless dedication with which he led this Organization into the twenty-first century. The Secretary-General has led the United Nations well and he will be remembered with praise for it. May I use this opportunity also to state our full support to his successor  who will have to deal with the difficult challenges the United Nations is going to face.  Before proceeding to my remarks  I would like to point out that Slovakia fully subscribes to the statement delivered earlier by the President of Finland on behalf of the European Union.  It gives me great pleasure to address the General Assembly today  even more so as it is the first time I am speaking from this rostrum as the Prime Minister of Slovakia. My Government — formed only three months ago — is committed to a foreign policy that emphasizes effective multilateralism and promotes democracy  international peace and security  greater respect for human rights — including the rights of persons belonging to national and other minorities — rule of law  social equity and environmental protection. We are focused on building a social state where economic growth goes along with the growth of the standard of living of the people.   All of us know that the United Nations is once again at a crossroads  as we face the historic test of multilateralism. The humanitarian disaster in Sudan  recent conflict in Lebanon  continuing dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme  violence in East Timor  increasing military activity in Afghanistan and Somalia  along with the negative developments in other conflict regions  remind us that we live in a world of evolving threats and challenges.  Modern threats could not have been anticipated when the United Nations was founded in 1945. In fact  the United Nations is challenged  as never before  to deal with ethnic and other inter-State conflicts  weak and failed States  genocide and ethnic cleansing  complex humanitarian disasters and poverty  along with threats of nuclear terrorism  transnational organized crime  infectious diseases and environmental degradation. The major challenges of today cannot be managed by sovereign States acting alone. Hence  the key challenge for all of us is to learn how to collectively manage the complex issues of the world of today and how to ensure the relevance of the United Nations and its leadership in the process.  Slovakia  as a smaller country  is a strong believer in multilateralism. Our present experience as an elected member of the Security Council fully proves that only through effective multilateral action can the world community successfully address modern threats and resolve current conflicts. But — and I underline that “but” — as long as the international community  acting through the United Nations  is unable to take    06-53005 18  decisive action to protect populations from genocide  war crimes  ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity  as in the case of Rwanda or Darfur  as long as the United Nations ignores regressive developments and violations of human rights in some parts of the world  as long as it is unable to fight terrorism more effectively and intervene in situations that do not yet pose a threat to international peace and security but have the potential to swiftly reach that stage  respect for the United Nations will decline in the eyes of our citizens.   Slovakia is  therefore  a strong supporter of United Nations reform. We must continue building on what has been achieved so far  including the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and progress in management reform. We need to focus on reducing tensions between developed and developing countries and on building consensus regarding the future direction of reforms. It is unrealistic to expect that all States will share and promote a single version of United Nations reform. But we have to overcome the zero-sum mentality and continue with the reform debate  with a view to achieving mutual concessions and compromises on specific issues.  We particularly welcome the creation of the Human Rights Council as a step towards realizing the idea of three equal councils embodying three equal pillars of the United Nations. But we ought to be cautious and avoid slipping back into the old habits that made its predecessor so dysfunctional.   Revitalization of the General Assembly  enhancement of the role of the Economic and Social Council and reform of the Security Council remain unfinished business. The reform of the Council should  first and foremost  address the issue of increasing its capacity to act preventively and to take decisive action early enough to prevent conflicts. The Security Council must become more representative  more effective and more transparent.   For its part  Slovakia is ready to engage constructively in meaningful negotiations to achieve those goals. Slovakia  as the co-chair of the ad hoc committee on mandate review in the Security Council  is working hard together with our partners to achieve tangible results in the near future. We hope that visible progress of the process within the Security Council can inspire other United Nations bodies.  Slovakia is concerned about the current situation in the Middle East  in particular in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. We firmly believe that there is no military solution to the Middle East conflict. The only way to achieve a comprehensive and lasting settlement is through peaceful negotiations and full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions  as well as the principles defined by the Quartet. Also  only through negotiations and further diplomatic efforts can we fulfil the vision of two democratic States  Israel and Palestine  living side-by-side in peace and security. New efforts must be undertaken to revive the peace process based on full respect for principles defined by the Quartet in the adopted road map.  Another source of our deep concern is the alarming security and humanitarian situation in Darfur  which continues to deteriorate in spite of numerous efforts of the Security Council  the African Union  the United Nations Secretary-General and the international community at large. We are talking here about a humanitarian disaster of large scale; we  therefore  urgently need to intensify our efforts and break the long-lasting cycle of violence.  In particular  we need to make sure that the Government of National Unity of Sudan finally gives its consent to the planned transition to a United Nations-led operation in Darfur. The concept of “responsibility to protect” adopted at last year’s World Summit applies to all Member States and to all Governments. When peaceful means prove inadequate and national authorities are failing to protect their own citizens  the international community has the responsibility to act collectively through the Security Council to prevent another Rwanda or Srebrenica.  As a matter of priority  Slovakia has been closely following developments in the Western Balkans. Our involvement there is based on the principles of transparency and impartiality. Our priority is to strengthen the stability of the region and to support the processes of democratization and integration.   As for the issue of the future of Kosovo  we continue to believe that it is important to seek a settlement through direct talks and dialogue and compromise  from both Belgrade and Pristina. Only a solution that reflects the concerns of all parties involved and provides for the rights of members of all communities  notably the Kosovo Serbs  can ensure   19 06-53005  lasting security and stability in the region. The Kosovo issue is truly a sui generis case.   We are also deeply concerned about the nuclear programme of Iran and the proliferation risk it presents to international peace and security. We urge the Iranian authorities to respond positively to the proposed package of incentives and to suspend its uranium enrichment activities. For our part  we are ready to continue the dialogue with Iran in a constructive and open fashion. However  Iran  like any other Member of the United Nations  must comply with Security Council resolutions and with all relevant decisions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  and must fully cooperate with them.   The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related delivery systems technology continues to threaten global security. This is a serious challenge  and we must face it with all responsibility. It requires joint multilateral efforts and a common and effective response. In May of this year  Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the Conference on Disarmament that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) regime  faces “a twin crisis  of compliance and of confidence”. With regret  we have to acknowledge that he was absolutely right.  We should work together to overcome deadly links like that between armament and proliferation and to create a progress-friendly atmosphere. We need to restore confidence through compliance with all relevant obligations and commitments. As the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to Council resolution 1540 (2004)  Slovakia tries to facilitate the process of the full implementation of all measures to prevent the formation of a nexus between the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. We hope that agreement on the Committee’s programme of work will be reached as soon as possible.   We also preside over the Conference on Disarmament  and we are working to intensify efforts to reverse the process of repeated failure during the recent period and undertake constructive dialogue  which would bring about long-expected results. Our aim is to help revitalize the Conference and give new breath to that single multilateral disarmament-negotiating forum of the international community.  In conclusion  I would like to draw attention to an issue which is increasingly important in shaping international programmes for development assistance  the promotion of democracy  security cooperation and post-conflict peacebuilding. I am referring to security-sector reform. Slovakia seeks to stimulate a broad discussion on the role of security-sector reform in the United Nations context  with a view to increasing understanding of the topic and suggesting possible options for the development of a comprehensive and coherent approach. Our wish is to give an impetus to developing a comprehensive policy framework that would guide United Nations security-sector reform programmes and projects in a coherent  consistent and sustainable way.   As Mr. Jan Eliasson stressed in his remarkable speech at the conclusion of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly (see A/60/PV.100)  the test of whether we have re-established the United Nations and international cooperation as the best way to manage our global affairs did not occur in the past year  but it will occur in the years ahead.  My wish is that all of us will pass the test and create a United Nations that can live up to the expectations and aspirations of our peoples.  "
"161",6507,"SVN",61,2006,"Let me first congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly. We believe that under her guidance we will continue the reform process laid out in the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). Our warm appreciation also goes to Mr. Jan Eliasson  President at the sixtieth session  for his inspiring leadership.  Let me take the opportunity to thank the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his brilliant opening speech a few days ago (see A/61/PV.3)  and for his decade of dedicated work for the United Nations. Slovenia appreciates the role of the Secretary-General in helping to expand our understanding of pressing issues  such as the protection of civilians and the responsibility to protect. The commitment of the Secretary-General to mainstreaming human rights in the work of the Organization and his emphasis on the rule of law in international relations and nationally will remain a permanent legacy. The report “In larger freedom” (A/59/2005) contains a fair vision of the global responsibility that we share and reminds us of the inevitable challenges that lie ahead.   25 06-53329   We live in a tightly interconnected  interdependent and transparent world. It is logical and it is right that nations should support and help each other. What place in the world is more appropriate for that recommendation than the United Nations? All nations and all people should be asking themselves how they can help each other. It appears that assistance and contributions from affluent countries are more effective. It seems easier for large nations to be great nations. Unfortunately  not all nations are large. That is true of most nations of the world  and it is  of course  true of my country.  The implementation of the global partnership for development is a priority of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to which Slovenia is fully committed. The new external financial instruments of the European Union as well as the tenth European Development Fund open a new chapter in the relations of the European Union with developing countries and strengthen Europe’s role as a global partner in development. That is a promising sign of progress in the fulfilment of our commitments under the Millennium Declaration.  In order to contribute in an important way  the small countries must make a special effort. We can  in fact  be effective. Smaller countries rarely threaten or endanger other countries. They have knowledge of small systems and knowledge of minorities within large systems. They can perform special tasks that demand special qualities and particular capabilities such as flexibility  adaptability  a spirit of empathy and cooperation. They can serve as honest brokers. There are a number of successful small and medium-sized countries. They can help each other to assume creative and relevant positions as part of the international community.  At the United Nations  we should continue to review the concept of sovereignty. Many fear that the erosion of sovereignty provides grounds for interfering in State internal affairs. Indeed  the potential for misuse is real. History teaches us that checks and balances are necessary in order to shield right against might. At the same time  the sovereignty of States must be understood in the context of contemporary reality. National borders are no longer an excuse for the international community to turn a blind eye to genocide  crimes against humanity and other gross human rights violations.  Last year  for the first time world leaders formally and universally affirmed the concept of the responsibility to protect. The 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) provides a detailed framework for individual and collective responsibility  in areas ranging from prevention and protection to rebuilding. We regard the framework as a conceptual breakthrough and wish to stress the need for all members of the international community  and the Security Council in particular  to deliver on the implementation of that responsibility in practice.  Many crises are evolving as we speak  some of which the international community will try to resolve  while giving less attention to others. The suffering of the civilian population in Darfur calls for our immediate efforts. We should not allow the tragedy that occurred in Rwanda or Bosnia and Herzegovina to be repeated in Darfur or anywhere else.  Attention to the Western Balkans must not diminish. We are committed to standing by our partners in the region in their endeavours to expand their relationship with the European Union and to facilitate the advent of prosperity for their citizens. Kosovo is now approaching an important and possibly sui generis stage in the peace process. Finding common ground between Serbian and Kosovar Albanian positions and striking a political deal will be difficult. We are confident  nevertheless  that all those involved will summon up sufficient courage to take a critical step forward and thus enable all ethnic groups in that region to coexist peacefully and cooperate. We hope that the integration process in Europe will provide the appropriate vehicle for the stabilization of the region.  The disintegration of rigid systems like those of the Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia has produced a number of new States and new Members of the United Nations. The process has sometimes been called Balkanization. But a closer look will reveal that many of the newborn countries  contrary to expectations  have not regressed. Quite the opposite: a lot of them have progressed  democratized and reintegrated  or have expressed the desire to integrate in a different way and have positioned themselves on a new level. Many former republics of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have thus become  or intend to become  members of new multinational systems  such as the European Union.    06-53329 26   Occasionally  we still hear expressions of hesitation and fear: we should not  they say  sacrifice our national interests for the sake of integration. One of the problems of the international community today is complex relations within multinational  multi-ethnic and multicultural systems. The question is how to facilitate the productive coexistence of national  ethnic  religious and other minorities.   In the past  in Europe and elsewhere  mighty dynasties or nations  driven by the ambition to rule over weaker nations and minorities  practised imposed integration. Modern integration no longer rests on subordination; it depends on solidarity and cooperation. Modern nations cultivate complementarity. In the future  the United Nations should encourage new projects and provide an efficient framework for the management of religious diversity and dialogue between cultures. We could then learn from countries that had experienced a successful transition from a central and autocratic system to a decentralized and democratic system. Essentially  we are concerned with sustained assistance in the transition to democracy and coexistence within multi-ethnic or multicultural systems.  I support the idea of the dialogue of cultures. However  we should be careful not to develop that concept into a clearinghouse for one set of standards. If so  failure is a certainty. A dialogue between two sides each convinced of the absolute truth of its own existence is impossible. When dealing with subjective or intimate concepts like faith  respect and individual dignity  we can only hope to encourage debate within individual systems  not between them. In the latter case  one would be imposing one’s truth on the value system of another.  Rather  a dialogue of cultures should be a venue for cross-cultural discussion on objective matters like democratic political systems  sustainable development  security and energy. The promotion of dialogue on matters of faith  culture or civilization is an indispensable tool to create bridges between different cultures.   Is there a general clash of civilizations? My own answer is “no”. On the other hand  we should not underestimate local and temporary clashes that may serve purposes far from genuine cultural or religious issues. There is one welcome and necessary clash: the clash of our common and global civilization against illegitimate radical groups that strive for power by means of terror and that abuse religious beliefs and ethnic bonds for their own particular agendas. We have to be aware of this when dealing with such issues in our own countries and stand ready to assist each other if we are to preserve the universal values of civilization.  Last year  Slovenia chaired the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; today  we begin our year at the helm of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency  and a little more than a year from now we shall assume the presidency of the European Union (EU). As a member  and current Chair  of the Human Security Network  a group of nations with diverse regional affiliations  we are looking forward to deepening the understanding of the concept of human security in order to be better equipped to overcome the complex problems of the modern world.  One of the items on the agenda of the Slovenian EU presidency will certainly be energy security. To facilitate insight into regional energy and stability issues  the international conference entitled Caspian Outlook 2008  recently organized in Slovenia under the auspices of the Bled Strategic Forum  offered an interesting experience in terms of how such issues can be addressed at the regional level by parties that share the same concern but look at it from different perspectives. At the end of the day  all interested partners have much to gain from political stability  reliable flows of energy and stronger partnerships.  The Middle East crisis once again calls for the focused attention of the international community. Attempts to address this problem in all its complexity and with the involvement of many countries should continue with renewed energy. Slovenia is playing its part in contributing to the immediate relief of the situation in Lebanon through its contribution of troops to the United Nations peacekeeping force there.  Slovenia welcomes the progress made towards the implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use  Stockpiling  Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. However  there are some aspects of mine action on which we should continue to focus: dealing with the universality of the Convention  the clearing of minefields and providing assistance to mine victims. Through its International Trust Fund for Demining and   27 06-53329  Mine Victims Assistance  Slovenia is striving to alleviate the humanitarian threat that anti-personnel landmines still pose to the safety  health and lives of local civilian populations.  I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight  in front of this distinguished audience  the importance of the role of small countries. Their orientations  activities and possibilities can contribute significantly to multilateralism.  "
"162",6552,"SWE",61,2006,"Let me start  Madam  by saying how pleased we are to see you presiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. You have our full support.  The latest cycle of violence in the Middle East and the recent escalation in Darfur have once again highlighted the need for a strong multilateral response to global challenges. Last year’s World Summit set out an ambitious agenda on how to strengthen the United Nations. Reform efforts must continue. The decisions made here in New York during the sixtieth session should be translated into concrete results in the field.  For too long  people in Darfur have suffered the appalling consequences of conflict. Our common efforts must be intensified to end the fighting and violence  to ensure respect for human rights and international humanitarian law and to end impunity. A   23 06-53952  United Nations peacekeeping force should be allowed to protect the people in Darfur. We urge the Government of the Sudan to accept such a force. A continued African Union force presence is crucial for the humanitarian situation and the transition towards a United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur. We urge rebel groups that have failed to sign up to the Darfur Peace Agreement to do so. Sweden stands ready to contribute to a United Nations mission in Darfur. We need to live up to the principle of the responsibility to protect that we accepted at last year’s Summit. The Security Council must show the will to act when civilian populations are threatened by the most serious crimes.  A comprehensive approach to the conflict in the Middle East is urgently needed  with the strong and increased involvement of the international community. Positive contributions will be required from key countries in the region  including Syria and Iran.  The events this past summer have shown that a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and long-term security for Israel are objectives that cannot be achieved by military means. Negotiations are the only avenue to peace. The Stockholm Conference last month resulted in immediate steps to extend support for Lebanon’s early recovery. It is vital that we sustain our commitment to Lebanon’s reconstruction and to the strengthening of its sovereignty. Full implementation by all parties of Security Council resolutions 1559 (2004) and 1701 (2006) is needed. Sweden is currently preparing a military contribution to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies at the core of the tensions in the Middle East. The vision of an independent and democratic Palestine  living side by side with a secure Israel  based on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)  must be revived and concretized. Israel’s right to exist should be unequivocally recognized by all. We condemn rocket attacks against Israeli territory. Terrorist attacks can never be justified and must end.  Sweden remains concerned at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank. Humanitarian access must be guaranteed  and humanitarian law should be observed throughout the occupied Palestinian territories. The expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories must stop. This settlement policy should instead be reversed as it undermines confidence in a credible political process  as does the building of the barrier on occupied Palestinian territory.  The situation in Iraq is serious  with its negative impact on security in the region and beyond and with untold suffering of innocent civilians. We need to help the Iraqi people build a future free from war and internal strife.  With an estimated 27 000 nuclear weapons in the world  we have to make progress in addressing the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. Disarmament and non-proliferation are crucial to world security. They are interlinked. We must press ahead for progress on both issues.  The international community’s concerns over Iran’s nuclear programme must be met. No one wishes to see an isolated Iran. Our wish is for Iran to take its rightful place among nations in international cooperation. But neither would we like to see an Iran that pursues a nuclear weapons option. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission  led by Mr. Hans Blix  has presented a large number of constructive recommendations in its report  entitled “Weapons of Terror”. These recommendations offer a way forward towards disarmament and non-proliferation.  There are over 1.1 billion people living in abject poverty in our world today. Well over 100 million children do not attend school. It is true that there has been progress. The number of extremely poor has declined by 130 million since 1990. Since the Monterrey Conference in 2001  aid has increased by over $50 billion.  The World Summit gave increased attention to development issues  forging a vital link between security  development and human rights in the fight against poverty. But this is not enough. If we are to implement the Millennium Development Goals by 2015  we have to do more. The primary responsibility lies with the developing countries themselves. They are in charge. Good governance must be the guiding principle at all levels. Donor countries should actively support the efforts of the developing countries to reduce poverty and lend their full support to developing countries in their efforts to increase their participation in international trade.  The High-level Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence provides a unique opportunity to    06-53952 24  revitalize the support of the United Nations to the developing countries. If the Organization can become more effective at the country level  it will be able to mobilize more resources and ensure that they will reach the countries in need.  Sweden has always given high priority to the strengthening of the United Nations. During this session  it is essential that we stay focused on implementing the decisions already taken and continue to seek agreement on outstanding issues from the Summit.  We created the Peacebuilding Commission as a tool to assist countries in managing the difficult transition from post-conflict situations. The country-specific commissions should now deliver results  beginning with Burundi and Sierra Leone.  The Human Rights Council must be a body that reacts firmly against violations of human rights.  Thousands of innocent men  women and children have been killed across the world through acts of terrorism. This global threat can only by met by collective action by Member States. That is why we adopted the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288) in the General Assembly a couple of weeks ago. It sends a strong political message that terrorism is unacceptable in all its forms and manifestations  committed by whomever  wherever and for whatever purposes  as it constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. The Strategy should now be implemented  with full respect for human rights. Let us also build upon this achievement to agree on a comprehensive convention on terrorism during the current session of the General Assembly.  The world needs a stronger and more effective United Nations. In order to realize this  we need to make further progress in Secretariat and management reform. While a number of initial steps were taken during the past year  some key reform proposals have been deferred to the sixty-first session. These need to be adopted and implemented.  The United Nations reform process will be incomplete as long as the Security Council remains unchanged. If we want its decisions to be genuinely accepted as legitimate and effective  we must reform the Council to better represent the world of today. This is a difficult but vital area of reform. While expanding the Council  we must safeguard its efficiency. Therefore  there should be no extension of the veto power. The use of the veto should be limited.  The General Assembly will remain at the heart of the United Nations. During the past 12 months  by agreeing on a number of essential reforms  the General Assembly has in many ways revitalized itself. Let us now continue to make full use of the broad mandate of this crucial body  representing all the Member States of the United Nations.  The time has come to build on the achievements of the United Nations over the past year and to seek solutions to the issues where we have been unable to agree. The time has come to prove that the United Nations can continue to make a difference — in Darfur  the Middle East or wherever there is conflict  poverty  and human suffering. "
"163",6590,"SWZ",61,2006,"It is a great honour and privilege for me to deliver this important statement on behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland. Allow me to convey the warm greetings and best wishes of His Majesty King Mswati III  Her Majesty the Queen Mother  the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland to the whole United Nations family.  The Kingdom of Swaziland warmly congratulates you  Madam  on your historic election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident that your wide experience and proven legal and diplomatic skills will ensure success in addressing the challenging and daunting issues that face the Assembly at this session. We would also like to commend the excellent work of your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden  in particular for his skilful leadership and the great effort he put into directing the General Assembly at its previous session.  The Kingdom of Swaziland would like to pay special tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his outstanding work during his tenure as our Secretary-General. Through his untiring and dedicated efforts  he demonstrated the vision and qualities that saw him successfully lead our Organization into the twenty-first century  despite the daunting challenges that the Organization faced. We also commend him for his initiatives in contributing to the economic and social development of the African continent through the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  The Kingdom of Swaziland is delighted to extend a warm welcome to our Organization’s newest Member  the Republic of Montenegro  whose accession is a further confirmation of respect for the principles of universality and representation enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.   However  as we welcome our new Member  we remain conscious of the fact that the principle of universality has not been applied to its fullest. I am referring to the exclusion of Taiwan. With the admission of Montenegro  almost all the countries of the world have become Members of this global Organization  all except one — Taiwan. The exclusion of this nation poses a legal and a moral challenge to the international community. The time has come for the United Nations to stop enforcing a policy of exclusion against the 23.6 million people of Taiwan. The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that accepting Taiwan as a member of the United Nations would not only restore the rights of the people of that island but would also contribute to ensuring that peace and stability is maintained in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that every country in that region should be allowed to participate in working towards peace  stability and positive development. We propose  therefore  that General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971 be reviewed carefully  with a view to restoring the legal and moral rights of the people of Taiwan to be part of the United Nations family.  The Kingdom of Swaziland joins the world in condemning terrorism and threats to international peace and security. We condemn all acts of terrorism that have taken place over the past year and we offer our sympathies and prayers to all those who were affected by such acts  especially the families and friends of those who lost their lives. The world has  in recent times  seen an upsurge of terrorism on an unprecedented level.  We welcome the recent agreement on a counter-terrorism strategy  which demonstrates the commitment of the international community to overcome the scourge of terrorism. It must be borne in mind that all States  large and small  and in every region  are vulnerable and could be affected by terrorism. Therefore  all Member States have to ensure that the strategy is implemented and further updated in order to confront the evolving challenges.   13 06-53958   We fully support the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty and call for the elimination of all nuclear weapons by those States that possess them. As part of our commitment to a peaceful world  we support the efforts of the Conference on Disarmament concerning the prohibition of the development and manufacture of new types of weapons of mass destruction. We also continue to be part of the campaign against the trafficking  sale and distribution of small arms and light weapons. Such weapons encourage terrorism on an international as well as on an individual level.  The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  and we look forward to the realization of the goals envisaged in the formation of that body. We are also proud to congratulate a sister State  the Republic of Angola  on her election to be the first to preside over this important and unique Commission.  The recent tragic events that took place in Lebanon and northern Israel are a cause for great concern and a challenge to the Peacebuilding Commission. The Kingdom of Swaziland stands firmly behind the collective effort of the international community to ensure the implementation of the Security Council resolution that ended the conflict between Israel and Hizbollah. We are of the view that a comprehensive peace process must be revived as a matter of urgency.  While we are especially encouraged by the developments towards peace on the African continent  we remain concerned about the worsening security situation in Darfur in western Sudan  where thousands of people have been killed and more than 2 million displaced since the conflict erupted in 2003. We urge the parties concerned to demonstrate a spirit of necessary compromise and to cooperate with efforts made to facilitate the search for peaceful and lasting solutions. The Kingdom of Swaziland supports unequivocally every effort that is being made to sustain peace in this area. We join our fellow Member States in calling for support from the United Nations. We fully hope and expect that commitments in words will be followed up by deeds.  We welcome the results of the historic first-round elections that took place in the Democratic Republic of Congo  the first of its kind in 40 years. These elections were the first crucial step towards the recovery of that country  and we support every effort by the United Nations and the international community to consolidate this achievement  bearing in mind that it will make a difference not only to the Democratic Republic of Congo but to the African continent as a whole.  The recently established Human Rights Council has just concluded a successful inaugural session. The Kingdom of Swaziland welcomes the creation of this historic new body. The creation of the Council was indeed a step in the right direction towards strengthening our Organization’s human rights tools. We believe that the work of the Council will be guided by the principles of universality  impartiality  objectivity  non-selectivity  international dialogue and cooperation. In this regard  we align ourselves with the rest of Africa in supporting a less-politicized body that will respond promptly to cases of human rights abuses in any part of the world.  The Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the ongoing reforms of the United Nations are essential  especially if the Organization is to retain its global credibility. It is therefore our hope that the many key reform proposals that were deferred to this session will be dealt with satisfactorily. Meanwhile  we welcome the progress that has been made so far  including the establishment of a United Nations Ethics Office  the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council.  Neither renewal nor reform would be complete without the reform of the Security Council. In the quest for an overall agreement on this issue  the Kingdom of Swaziland supports the position of the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Group concerning the composition and working methods of the Security Council. We hope and expect that positive results will flow from the conclusion of this matter.  As a Member State of this body  we recognize the vital role that the major United Nations conferences and summits have played in identifying commonly agreed objectives which should lead to the successful implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However  we do realize that nothing can be achieved without adequate funding  especially for developing nations. Even though promises have been made  the time has come for them to be translated into actions.  The breakdown and suspension of negotiations of the World Trade Organization’s Doha Round is    06-53958 14  lamentable. However  insofar as the outcome is concerned  the Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the needs of developing nations must be fully taken into consideration. Failure to do so will undermine the already limited trade opportunities of these nations and detract from the pursuit of policies in key areas  such as employment  industrialization  food security  rural development and sustained economic growth.  While we welcome the relevant ideas and general principles for designing microeconomic  sectoral and trade policies contained in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s Trade Development Report of 2006  we still believe that the specific needs of developing nations have to be addressed.  On a more domestic note  let me report that the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to be one of the biggest challenges faced by the Kingdom of Swaziland. As we begin to realize the benefits of a full-scale national roll-out of antiretroviral drugs  a critical area of concern is the care needed by the estimated 63 000 children who have been orphaned by the pandemic.  That is why  among many other structures we have put in place to curb this scourge  we have revived the concept of the “KaGogo”  which means  literally  “grandmother’s house”. These KaGogo centres are being constructed across the country and are a new initiative based on traditional ways that empower local communities to look after their orphans within traditional structures. During the High-level Conference on HIV/AIDS held in June 2006  His Majesty King Mswati III clearly spelled out the scale of the pandemic and how it is taking its toll on our nation. It is indeed our greatest challenge.  The Kingdom of Swaziland fully supports the Political Declaration that was adopted at the High-level Conference  and we are confident that this renewed commitment will strengthen the global response to the pandemic. Thus  we realize the urgency of combining our efforts to ensure that the rate of infection decreases and that greater access to treatment and care for those who are already living with the virus is achieved. We fully support the efforts of such organizations as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  especially in terms of minimizing the threat of HIV to young people. We believe that that is a moral obligation and is essential for halting the escalation of the infection rate. In this regard  we look forward to working closely with United Nations agencies in order to alleviate the situation.   On a more positive note  the Kingdom of Swaziland is now implementing the recommendations of our job creation summit  which took place last year. His Majesty King Mswati III always stands behind his people and fully supports the idea of the participation of the people in building the economy. For instance  he encourages them to start their own businesses as a means of reducing the unemployment level. However  we still face significant challenges  e.g.  market fluctuations in certain products such as sugar and textiles. We also encourage our people to enter into partnerships and join ventures with foreign direct investors in order to develop our nation.  In conclusion  allow me to allude to the fact that there is indeed much vital work to be completed during this sixty-first session of the General Assembly. The Kingdom of Swaziland is confident that the initiatives already taken will lead to the renewal of our Organization  and we look forward to a new dynamic and vibrant working period. We are indebted to the United Nations for all we have received and achieved over the years towards the development of our nation.  I am  therefore  charged by His Majesty The King  Her Majesty The Queen Mother  the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Swaziland with proclaiming the renewal of our commitment to the Charter of the United Nations. We ask for God’s blessings upon those charged with leading the Organization to give them the wisdom and direction they require to carry out these tasks on behalf of all the peoples of the world. "
"164",6619,"SYC",61,2006,"I wish to begin by extending my congratulations to Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I also express my country’s high regard for her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  who succeeded in spurring the implementation of United Nations reform.   I also pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his work at the head of our Organization  as reflected in the body of his achievements at the end of his two terms of office. Those achievements include the ongoing reform  the promotion of multilateralism  the prevention of armed conflict  peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance operations  the fight against HIV/AIDS and action on other fronts  in particular in combating poverty and terrorism.  Here I would like to briefly discuss United Nations reform. I echo the sentiments of all who have referred here to the pressing need for the United Nations to adapt to the realities of the world in which we live so that it will be more in tune with current concerns and managed in an effective and transparent manner: an Organization whose Charter recognizes that all States  small and large  possess the right to have their say in the conduct of affairs that are of interest to the international community.   Seychelles thus supported the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council  the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and the resolution on development. We await with great interest the outcome of the ongoing reform of the Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat and its management  and of the revitalization of the General Assembly in keeping with its great authority and enhanced role.   We hope that the General Assembly will take an active part in the appointment of the next Secretary-General  who  we all agree  should be from Asia and with proven qualities and demonstrated leadership. Moreover  the reform of the Security Council is of particular importance in the light of the current challenges to world peace and to the Council’s institutional legitimacy.   Now  let me say a few words on the national policy of Seychelles. My country recently held elections in a climate of tranquillity and social harmony. Following the election of President Michel  and on the basis of the new road map that he has drawn for his administration  Seychelles will place even greater emphasis on ensuring sustainable development in all sectors: economic  social  cultural and environmental. The policies seek to guarantee the best possible standard of living for all citizens.   Opening up the economy  respecting human rights and the rule of law and pursuing the objectives of good governance will continue to define the actions of our Government. However  we must note that  as the World Bank and the Commonwealth have highlighted in their joint report  over the past five years small developing States have seen gross national product growth rates decline in comparison to those of large  low-income and middle-income countries. Small States have also experienced an increasingly burdensome foreign debt. Concerning access to foreign capital  there is a trend in private markets to consider small   9 06-53958  States to be of high risk  which leads to increased costs that complicate access to those markets.  In recent years  meetings have been held  resolutions have been adopted and statements have been made followed by further meetings  but with little concrete action and without any satisfactory response to our concerns. Seychelles regrets that. The global community is made up of 192 States  and more than 80 of them are small States.  Confronted by these structural development problems in the context of a globalized economy  small States rarely have the means and the capacity to respond appropriately to them. In that connection  the appeal made by the President of the General Assembly for a global development partnership has never been so urgent and critical. The Seychelles hopes that at its sixty-first session the Assembly will take a decisive step forward in bringing about such a partnership.  I should like to conclude my statement by referring to the issues of regional and world peace. Armed conflicts are occurring at a pace that shows that  contrary to our hopes  the world remains unstable and dangerous. Unfortunately  peace and ceasefire agreements do not always lead to a cessation of hostilities. Civilian populations  composed mostly of women and children  continue to be displaced  maltreated and  too often  the victims of crimes and massacres. The situation in Darfur is the most tragic illustration. Those who survive do not always have access to humanitarian aid. Today  according to a United Nations report  even the level of violence facing humanitarian aid teams is unprecedented.   We are all aware of the real causes of wars. Sadly  sometimes the only way to reach a consensus is to say nothing; as the saying goes  diplomacy consists of conversations between friends  and only rarely with the enemy. That is why the Seychelles joins all those in Africa  the Middle East  Asia and everywhere else who hope for a more human  more just and freer world where peace is the rule  not the exception  and not a privilege but a right. That also applies to those countries — such as Palestine and Western Sahara — that hope someday to be able to conduct their affairs as they see fit  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.  Finally  I should like to reaffirm the support of the Seychelles for the work undertaken by the President of the General Assembly to make the sixty-first session an instrument for peace and development.

"165",6665,"SYR",61,2006,"I congratulate you  Madam President  and your fraternal country  Bahrain  on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. You are the first Arab woman ever to assume this high position. Your selection to this post is proof that the empowerment of women has become an integral part of the Arab experience.   I should be remiss if I failed to express to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  our sincere appreciation for the efforts he made to bring a successful conclusion to the work of last session. I also express our thanks to Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for his efforts leading the Organization for the past ten years. We appreciate the constructive efforts he exerted during his last visit to the Middle East.  For decades the Middle East region has been the stage for many daunting and exacerbated challenges. It has endured continued Israeli occupation of Arab territories since 1967 and the denial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. Peoples of our region have lost hope of realizing their aspirations to justice  peace and security. A short time ago Israel launched its destructive war against Lebanon. The Palestinian situation  in the grip of Israeli occupation  continues to deteriorate. Acts of aggression are on the rise while the rights of the people continue to be trampled under foot. Palestinians are subjected to a crippling blockade because the advocates of democracy were dissatisfied with the results of elections in the Palestinian territories.   Our region is in the grip of a volatile situation brought about by a protracted and relentless occupation. There are few  if any  prospects for change that will hold the promise of a safe  just and stable life for our people. Can we turn the current situation into a prelude to the solution rather than a consecration of tension and confrontation?  That important question is essential to understanding the suffering of our peoples. For decades they have been yearning for the realization of a just and comprehensive peace through a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict that will end occupation  restore rights  and allow for the realization of the objectives of development. That is the path to take in order to address the root causes of the problems of the region before talking about a new or a greater Middle East.   The international community must realize that continued Israeli occupation of Arab territories is the hotbed of all the problems of the region. It is the origin of the encompassing anger that consumes its peoples. I wonder  is the region destined to live one endless war after another? Can any one expect our people to draw comfort and satisfaction from the occupation of their territories and the violation of their rights? Are they expected to exalt the financers and supporters of this   19 06-53609  persistent injustice  who can redress it only if they are willing? Is the region destined to endure a new war  complementing the war against Lebanon  in favour of a new Middle East  and recalling once again the birthpangs of bloodshed and destruction during the war against Lebanon  instead of embracing the opportunity to open the door to peace in the region?  The suffering of the Palestinian people continues and their tragedy has heightened over the years. Some members of the international community have become accustomed to dealing with the suffering as if it were a natural phenomenon  not an unprecedented humanitarian and national tragedy. We in Syria are victims of that tragedy in all its aspects and are influenced by its repercussions. We support the efforts of our Palestinian brothers to close their ranks and encourage them to form a Government of national unity. The suffering of our people in the occupied Syrian Golan continues as well and all Syrians suffer because of this occupation.  From this rostrum I salute the struggle and steadfastness of our people in the Golan and in Palestine in the face of the Israeli policies of tyranny and terrorism. It is extremely important for the international community to recognize that the deep-rooted anger and resentment consuming our region  particularly after the senseless war against Lebanon  and the continued logjam in efforts for peace  constitute a dangerous and complex situation and can only lead to confrontation instead of peace. This will not serve the interests of anyone  inside the region or outside it. We too want a new Middle East  one where a just and comprehensive peace prevails  based on right  justice  and guaranteeing the same security to all.  Fifteen years ago Syria declared that the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace was its strategic choice. It took part in the peace process that began in Madrid  based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and on the principle of land for peace. Negotiations continued for 10 years but did not bear fruit. The Syrian Golan continues to be under occupation and peace remains elusive. It was clear beyond any doubt that the Israeli political will to make peace was non-existent. Peacemaking first requires political will  to be followed by the implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy.   Israel launched a brutal war against Lebanon  destroying life and property. Thanks to the courageous Lebanese resistance  its honourable steadfastness and its national unity  Lebanon warded off the aggression and defeated the aggressor. The Security Council ultimately adopted its long-awaited resolution 1701 (2006)  and my country  Syria  said it would cooperate with the United Nations to implement that resolution.   Syria adopted the necessary measures to control its borders with fraternal Lebanon. Syria is committed to Lebanon’s independence and sovereignty and demands the withdrawal of Israel from all Lebanese occupied territories  including from the Lebanese Sheba’a farms. We hope that Lebanon will be able to overcome the consequences of the Israeli aggression through the unity of its people and the assistance provided by its brothers  friends  and the international community  so that it will recover and be prosperous again. I stress here Syria’s commitment to the establishment of good relations with Lebanon in the interests of the two fraternal peoples and countries.  On the other side of the Syrian border  Iraq is enduring extremely distressing circumstances that are causing us serious concern as both a brother of Iraq and a neighbouring country. Syria supported the political process in Iraq. I reaffirm today our support for the Iraqi Government that came to power after elections in which all segments of the Iraqi people participated. We express Syria’s readiness to cooperate with this Government in all fields. We support the Iraqi Government’s plan for national reconciliation and stand ready to provide all the necessary support  because we are committed to the unity of Iraq and its people.   Drawing up a schedule for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq is essential  since it will assist in curbing the violence and ensuring the safety and security of its citizens. Syria  which mourns every drop of Iraqi blood shed  repeats its condemnation of all the terrorist acts that have been and continue to be perpetrated in Iraq  resulting in a high toll among innocent Iraqi citizens.  Five years have passed since the terrorist criminal act of 11 September 2001  which left thousands of innocent people dead. I repeat our condemnation of that act and our sympathy with the victims of that heinous terrorist crime. To the American people  who were the force behind great scientific achievements    06-53609 20  that benefited humanity  I say  “You are the victims of policies that were proved wrong in the Arab and other regions of the world.” Many innocent people in places so distant from the United States of America have unfortunately paid the price and suffered the dire consequences of those failed policies.   Tragically enough  we all end up paying a heavy price when the decision makers in Washington believe that they know better and are in a better position to understand and grasp the needs and circumstances of the Arabs. They diagnose the ambitions and aspirations of the Arab individual in a manner that is tailored to their own vision.   The fact is that we  the people of the region  know our circumstances and the priorities of the millions angered by the denial of their sovereign  national rights. If anyone asked the angry millions about their priorities and objectives  the sure answer would be “We want an end to the Israeli occupation of our lands in Palestine  Lebanon and the Golan. We want to recover all our usurped rights. We want the flow of American weapons to Israel  which are sowing death and destruction  to stop. We refuse hegemony over our resources and interference in our affairs. We want a Middle East governed by peace and built on right and justice  a Middle East where people can dedicate all their energies and resources to development and progress and embrace the positive trends in contemporary human thought and endeavour.”  After years of the war on terror  one asks “Has the world become a safer place?” It is clear that the war did not achieve its objective and that terror has become more widespread. That could be explained by the fact that combating terrorism exclusively through the use of force accomplishes nothing unless the root causes of terrorism are addressed. We must mobilize the efforts of the international community to deal with this dangerous scourge  taking into account the need to distinguish between fighting terrorism and people’s legitimate right to resist foreign occupation.   We also believe that the war on terror has been misused at times. It looked as if it was masking the clash of cultures and civilizations  which eventually not only proved detrimental to the interests of all the parties concerned but also played into the hands of terrorists and terrorism.  Israel is the sole Power in possession of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. It refuses to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to submit to the comprehensive safeguards regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency. That poses a threat to peace and security in the region. On 29 December 2003  on behalf of the Arab Group  Syria submitted to the Security Council a draft resolution to rid the Middle East region of all weapons of mass destruction. We still hope to adopt that resolution as soon as possible.   My country joins many other developing countries that have expressed concern over the restrictions on access by Member States  particularly developing countries  to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  In conclusion I stress that the Middle East currently stands at a crossroads. It has the option either to take the road to justice  peace and security  or be faced  even more than before  with tension and confrontation that would not be in the interests of any party inside or outside the region. It is up to the parties concerned to understand the danger inherent in turning our backs on the road to peace  not yet taken. Everything also hinges on the active role that our international Organization must play to maintain international peace and security  beginning with the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). I hope that objectivity and the desire for peace will trump other options so that the Middle East can be ushered into a new  secure and prosperous era after decades of suffering. "
"166",6710,"TCD",61,2006,"First and foremost  Madam President  on behalf of my delegation and on my own behalf  permit me to convey to you our heartfelt congratulations on your outstanding election to the presidency of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. We are certain that due to your qualities  talent and experience  you will lead us satisfactorily in our work. Our congratulations are also directed to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson and his team  whose dedication and fervour have enabled us to accomplish an enormous amount of work that has been appreciated by all and was carried out within an especially troubling international context.   In addition  we would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General of our Organization  whose extremely important role in promoting the implementation of our ideals will be engraved in the annals of our Organization.  We have unceasingly  before this same Assembly  condemned all forms of violence and intolerance  especially in its most terrible manifestation that has been most visible in our time — terrorism. We have committed ourselves to respect the United Nations Charter  which was created precisely to save   33 06-53323  succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to maintain international peace and security.  Our responsibility requires that we work together in order to eliminate the major scourges that threaten humanity. With regard to fighting terrorism  I reiterate that my country has signed and ratified most of the international instruments pertaining to that scourge  and that it is cooperating with different countries and relevant United Nations institutions in order to continue that fight. Furthermore  along with terrorism  the past year has seen alarming situations in many young States that are victims of war and serious armed conflicts  taking place throughout the world  and that cause instability and challenge the efforts made by those States to establish democratic institutions and foster socio-economic progress for their peoples.   As far as my country is concerned  despite attempts to destabilize and anti-constitutional seizures of power — problems that it continues to experience — we organized free and transparent presidential elections for 3 May 2006  in which the Chadian people renewed their confidence in His Excellency President Idriss Deby Itno. Subsequently  a political dialogue took place from 28 July to 2 August 2006 in N’Djamena. There  54 out of the 78 legally recognized political parties took part in that important forum  whose conclusions will  undoubtedly  lay the foundation for the consolidation of the rule of law and the strengthening of the democratic process in our country.  It would be an illusion to think that my country will enjoy the necessary stability  without difficulties  needed to consolidate the democratic rule of law  if it continues to suffer the pernicious effects of the Darfur crisis. We have just normalized our relations with the Sudan  after we had been compelled to break off diplomatic relations because of the subversive plotting against us in connection with Darfur. We hope to renew the bonds of friendship and good neighbourliness with that fraternal country that we have had in the past.   Nevertheless  we continue to be concerned about the Darfur crisis  which threatens not just our security  but also that of the entire subregion. The Darfur conflict has caused enormous harm to Chad and the Chadian people since it began in 2003  including a lack of security  economic loss and environmental destruction. Incursions of the Janjaweed into Chadian territory brought the fighting in Darfur into the eastern part of Chad  resulting in the displacement of more than 50 000 Chadians  the deaths of hundreds and the plundering of thousands of heads of livestock  among other problems.  Chad was the first country to receive and assist refugees from Darfur — more than 300 000 — before the international community intervened. In addition to those refugees  we have an increasing number of Central African refugees. Central Africa is  after Chad  the next biggest victim of the Darfur crisis  which risks spreading — if we are not careful — throughout the entire subregion of Central Africa.  In that connection  we welcome the extension to the end of December 2006 of the African Union mission in Darfur. It is better than nothing. Nevertheless  faced with the difficulties of the Government of the Sudan and the African Union in containing the crisis  we reaffirm our position that is well known and not new. The United Nations must take over from the African Union  pursuant to Security Council resolution 1706 (2006). We say that in friendship with our Sudanese brothers  while respecting their sovereignty. Our position should in no way be construed as hostile to the fraternal Government of the Sudan. It has nothing to do with what some are calling an international conspiracy against the Sudan. It is based simply on common sense and is aimed at providing assistance to the innocent victims of the war. Furthermore  Chad has more to gain than any other country from the restoration of peace to Darfur  if only because that would enable the hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees located on our territory to return to their country and thus put an end to the sacrifices being made by the Chadian host population.  Furthermore  we are finding it difficult to ensure the security of the refugee camps  which  as they are open and located not very far from the border  are used by some Sudanese rebels as safe havens  resupply stations and recruiting grounds. That is why we had hoped that international forces would be sent to the eastern part of the country to help us to secure the refugee camps and guarantee their neutrality  as well as to ensure the security of the common border and to prevent the crisis in Darfur from spilling over.  At this time of rapid globalization  which many thought would be inclusive and beneficial  the gap between rich and poor countries is growing. Despite the efforts being made by our States — which are    06-53323 34  weakened and subjected to abusive constraints by international institutions and other partners — the integration of our economies within the globalization process aimed at achieving harmonious and sustainable development still seems remote  while the current rules and regulations of the market economy undermine the competitiveness of our economies. How can our beset countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals given our ongoing lack of income  the heavy debt burden and the scourges of HIV/AIDS and malaria?  My country had a disagreement with the World Bank following our revision of Law 001 pertaining to oil revenues. We are therefore pleased with the fruitful dialogue that we have had with the Bank  which has led to a mutually acceptable compromise and to the resumption of our cooperation with that great institution.   In the same vein  with regard to the defence of our interests so that our people can benefit from the natural resources of our country  it should be pointed out to the international community that there has been a recent deterioration in our relationship with two members of the oil consortium that is active in our country because they have refused to pay a profits tax to the Chadian authorities. Furthermore  we have expressed the outrage of the people of Chad at the fact that they benefit from only 12.5 per cent of the fees associated with the exploitation of their oil resources. We have denounced the fact that three years of the sale of our oil yielded us only $588 million  while the oil companies amassed $5 billion. We ask that justice be done. Indeed  we demand our legitimate right to participate directly in the production and marketing of our resources. If we cannot  the sovereign rights of our country will be trampled underfoot  its objective of poverty reduction will come to naught and our dream of economic and social progress will remain an illusion.  Beyond our own problems  we are concerned about conflict situations elsewhere on the continent and in other parts of the world. We welcome the efforts made within the African Union and the United Nations to find lasting solutions  and we express our readiness to provide assistance to the extent possible.   For example  we believe that the national reconciliation process in Côte d’Ivoire is on the right track  although some minor problems have been encountered. We note that both the African Union and the United Nations are playing a major role there. All Ivorian political stakeholders must acknowledge the pain and suffering of the people and understand that there are limits to the patience of the members of international community. They must make a determined effort to put an end to the conflict — a conflict that has had grave consequences for the stability of the subregion.  In the Middle East  including Palestine  we were appalled and outraged by the recent events that took place in southern Lebanon  resulting in the massive destruction of the infrastructure of the country and the loss of life among civilians. We hope that the provisions of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) will be respected with a view to a favourable outcome.   We also remain concerned about the continuing deterioration of the situation in the Palestinian territories  especially the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. We call on the international community to involve itself more fully in the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  which has for too long been a source of instability in that region.  Anti-personnel landmines and unexploded ordnance are a legacy of armed conflict  and my country continues to pay a high price for armed conflicts and other wars conducted on its territory. As a State party to the Ottawa Convention  it is in the process of destroying them in cooperation with friendly countries  international organizations and non-governmental organizations and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their ongoing support. I request those friendly countries and institutions to continue to provide assistance so that the programme to combat those deadly devices can be strengthened.  The structures of our Organization are neither fair nor democratic. In this regard  my country continues to align itself with the African position with regard to the restructuring of the United Nations  including the expansion of the Security Council  with a view to ensuring equitable representation for all regions of the world. The reforms undertaken in the past year  especially in the framework of the implementation of the recommendations and decisions of the 2005 Summit  have the unswerving support of my country  which is looking forward with interest to the outcome of the various consultations currently under way.

"167",6756,"TGO",61,2006,"First  on behalf of our delegation  I warmly congratulate the President on her election to preside over this session  which encourages the Government of Togo in its commitment to value the role of women in our society. Togo remains convinced that the specific insights of women in the management of national or international affairs will make a big contribution to giving a more united and human face to relations between peoples and nations. The President can rest assured that as she does her inspiring job Togo will continue to support her unstintingly.   I also pay a merited tribute to the President’s predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  whose competence  moderation  sense of compromise and character earned him the respect and esteem of all during the last session.   In addition  I pay particular tribute to the Secretary-General  and express to him our sincere gratitude for his tireless efforts for peace  democracy and development. We appreciate his commitment and his bold proposals to ensure substantial and fair reform of the United Nations.  In our quest for peace  security and socio-economic development Togo has just reached a critical stage in its history  with the signing on 20 August of the Comprehensive Political Agreement at the end of an open  constructive and inclusive dialogue. When the Head of State took the initiative to resume the political dialogue we were aware that our current stage of social and political development would not allow us to deal with all matters of discord or eliminate all political and institutional problems. It was necessary first to strengthen the dynamic of national mobilization and social cohesion by promoting a policy of openness  calm and national reconciliation.   The desired results have largely been achieved  with the effective and active participation of all the major political participants in the dialogue. Everyone was able to speak freely on the substantive problems that were feeding the persistent feeling of crisis. The frank and responsible discussions  and the conclusions reached  enable us to establish bolder conditions for reform and lay the foundations for a new covenant for the republic and for national harmony.   The conclusions of the national dialogue favour the holding of free and democratic elections. Additionally  the resolution of the dialogue regarding the need to re-examine the role and mission of the army and the other security services allows us to anticipate an unprecedented strengthening of measures to maintain public order and provide more security for the activities of political parties and various other organizations  as well as the electoral processes.   After the social dialogue — involving employers  unions and the Government  and a number of bold measures aimed at youth and workers of all categories — a milestone will be reached with the holding of free legislative elections  pluralist and transparent  in the very near future. Togo will then have satisfied all the commitments made to the European Union on 14 April 2004 in Brussels.   In an attempt to give every opportunity for national harmony  implement the conclusions of the political dialogue and establish sustainable democracy  a broad-based Government of National Unity was established on 20 September 2006. All sections of the Togolese people  in their political  social and regional diversity  are represented in it. All the changes under way in Togolese society were made possible by the support of the international community  the maturity of the people of Togo and  of course  the sense of compromise of the political class.   We are very grateful to all our international partners who assisted us during this process of peacebuilding in our country. Our appreciation goes in particular to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)  the African Union  the European    06-53609 24  Union  the International Organization of la Francophonie  France  Germany  the United States of America and all African heads of State  who have always been very attentive to what we have had to say. I wish also  and very particularly  to express to the Facilitator  Mr. Blaise Compaoré  President of Burkina Faso  the gratitude of our entire Government and people for his critical role in the conclusion and signing of the Comprehensive Political Agreement.  Consolidating peace in Togo and the success of our democratization process remain closely linked to the stability of the regional and international environment. Therefore  Togo continues to be concerned about the situation in Côte d’Ivoire. Given the many preconditions for organizing elections in that neighbouring country  there must be concern  from any point of view  about the fulfilment of the mission for which the United Nations is responsible. We hope that the resolution of those preconditions will permit the holding of free and democratic elections leading Côte d’Ivoire to sustainable peace.   Similarly  with regard to the region of Darfur and Somalia  in the absence of a much more vigorous voluntary mobilization by the international community to end the cycle of violence and the tragedy of the peoples concerned  peace will not come soon to that part of Africa.  In other parts of the world  the continuing developments in both Iraq and the Middle East are a major source of concern for the Government of Togo. Togo firmly believes it is high time that the people of Iraq were reconciled and that the international community provided all the necessary support for their Government to help it complete the reconciliation process. It should be emphasized that the countries of the subregion have an important role to play in the quest for peace in Iraq.  The tragedy that unfolded in Lebanon weighs on our conscience. Togo welcomes the Security Council’s adoption of resolution 1701 (2006)  whose effective implementation will permit the return of peace to the country.   At the heart of the Middle East conflict is the thorny question of Palestine. Sustainable peace in the region requires an end to the continuous cycle of violence and a climate of confidence  which would make possible talks to create a Palestinian State alongside the State of Israel  the two of them coexisting within secure and internationally recognized borders.  While the resolution of crises and conflicts remains at the heart of our concerns  everything must be done to consolidate peace in countries emerging from conflicts  or countries which  after great efforts  have succeeded in their democratization process. Therefore  the Peacebuilding Commission must play a vital role in African countries emerging from conflicts. We are pleased that it is already considering the situation in Burundi and Sierra Leone. It must also help Liberia to strengthen its regained peace and make sure that Guinea-Bissau does not sink into violence. Similarly  while we welcome the holding of legislative and presidential elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Togo calls on the international community to pay sustained attention to that country so as to assist it until its still fragile process is completed.  Disarmament efforts by the international community are still far from producing the desired results. On the Korean peninsula the nuclear question is still unresolved  and there is a need for a strengthening of mutual confidence among the States concerned. Therefore  my country firmly supports every effort to resolve the region’s security questions peacefully. We believe also that the question of the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot be resolved without negotiations between the interested parties  and we call on them to create conditions conducive to such talks. It would not be wise to stop the country  by whatever means  developing a nuclear programme  essentially peaceful  for its fundamental research needs and the socio-economic development of its population.  With respect to small arms and light weapons  Togo regrets that the international community was unable to successfully conclude the July 2006 New York United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects  adopted in 2001. The failure of that Conference is not encouraging for regional and subregional initiatives. At the same time  the adoption in June this year of the ECOWAS Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons  Their Ammunition and Other Related Materials is very much part of strengthening confidence-building measures among States in the subregion. It is to be hoped that at this   25 06-53609  session the General Assembly will seriously examine the question of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons  which are a destabilizing factor for African States in particular  and a threat to the peace and security of people in general.   I should also like to emphasize the importance of our collective responsibility to counter terrorism and human rights violations. The reply of the international community to terrorism should be appropriate and should correspond to the expectations of peoples who only wish to live in a world free from fear. The General Assembly’s adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is to be welcomed. We hope that the Human Rights Council will contribute to strengthening the capacity of States to promote and protect human rights by developing and implementing appropriate strategies and programmes. Accordingly  on 10 July the Government concluded an agreement on establishing an office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Togo.   The current state of the world — characterized by a considerable increase in United Nations membership  from 51 Member States in 1945 to 192 in 2006  the emergence of new Powers  the persistence of certain conflicts and especially the frequent paralysis in the Security Council — requires that the United Nations be reformed as soon as possible  as the September 2005 World Summit recommended. While the objective of reform is to make the Organization more effective and efficient  we must not lose sight of the fact that a central  urgent factor is Security Council reform. If that is not included  the reform will be unfinished business.  Decisions related to economic development and the elimination of poverty adopted by the September 2005 World Summit have rekindled hope about the will of the rich industrialized countries to assist the countries of the South to promote sustainable development for their peoples. Implementation of the commitments made would permit achievement of the goals. Therefore  the countries of the South ask the countries of the North to commit themselves not only to keep their promises to make a genuine contribution to reducing poverty by 50 per cent by 2015  but finally to eradicate it.   As the Assembly is well aware  the support of the rich industrialized countries will enable us to consolidate the efforts that the countries of the South continue to make  efforts which have allowed us to improve macroeconomic management by tackling inflation and consolidating a balanced budget. However  the global incidence of extreme poverty has not declined  especially in the less developed countries  where combating poverty is still a very difficult task.  The situation that I have just described is exacerbated by factors that the developing countries have not been able to master. They include  to mention just a few: the external debt  deterioration in the terms of trade  the weakness of official development assistance  and environmental degradation. Moreover  the HIV/AIDS pandemic presents a major challenge to growth and economic development. Major conferences organized under United Nations auspices are slow to yield results. The status review of the Millennium Development Goals  held in September 2005  and the failure of the Doha Round and the midterm review of the Brussels Programme of Action for Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010  held on 18 and 19 September  have shown that there are still barriers to implementing the commitments made.  It is therefore regrettable that development partners have not always honoured their official development commitments to the least developed countries. Nevertheless  promises made recently  in particular by the G-8 Summit in 2005  regarding an increase in assistance and debt relief  have given us reason for some optimism. Additionally  access to markets and the gradual elimination of agricultural subsidies by all countries simultaneously  on dates set by the World Trade Organization  would contribute to the development of poor countries  since agriculture is the basis of the existence of hundreds of millions of people in the least developed countries. For Togo it is essential that progress be made in resolving questions relating to cotton  in particular  questions that remain vital for many developing countries.  My country welcomes the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development  held on 14 and 15 September  during which the General Assembly dealt with the multiple aspects of international migration. We must do more in-depth thinking on ways to stem the tide of the massive and hazardous exodus to northern countries. An arsenal of repressive measures alone will not resolve a situation that is becoming more and more like a scourge.   In conclusion  I emphasize that if we are faithful to our common destiny and our worldwide partnership    06-53609 26  based on solidarity we can realize the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore  the countries of both the North and the South must honour their commitments  thus contributing to ending the suffering of millions of disinherited people throughout the world and to promoting international peace and security.

"168",6801,"THA",61,2006,"At the outset  allow me to congratulate you  Madam President  and the Kingdom of Bahrain on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. As a woman  I welcome your election with great pride and wish to assure you of my delegation’s full support in every possible way.  I also wish to express my delegation’s profound appreciation to President Jan Eliasson  your predecessor  for his hard work and dedication in advancing the United Nations reform agenda over the past year.  Also  I take this opportunity to welcome the Republic of Montenegro as a new member of the United Nations.  As I speak  Thailand is going through a critical period — a transition  following the military intervention  to a needed reform process that will strengthen our democracy in both its form and content. As a peace-loving country  we are grateful that the political change in Thailand has taken place peacefully. The situation in the country returned to normal within hours. On behalf of the Thai people  I wish to thank our friends for their understanding and support.   25 06-53952   With the resilience of Thai society  the General Assembly can be assured that Thailand will emerge as a stronger and more vibrant democracy. We will ensure a swift return to democracy within a definite timeline. An interim constitution will be promulgated in the coming days  with the military once again being placed under the constitution. This interim constitution will provide full guarantees for civil liberties and rights under the supervision of our National Human Rights Commission. Under the interim constitution  a new civilian Government will again be put in place within the coming days  and we can well expect that one of the first tasks of the new Government will be to abolish martial law.  Constitutional reform will lead to a new constitution and general elections within one year  if not sooner. It is the hope of the Thai people that  as a result of this reform  independent organizations to be re-established under the new constitution will become more effective in carrying out their tasks to check and monitor the work of the executive branch of Government. This is the challenge and the promise.  I wish to assure the General Assembly that Thailand’s foreign policy will remain unchanged. The conduct of our foreign policy will continue to be guided by the spirit and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter  and we remain firm in our commitment to our obligations under international treaties and agreements to which we are party.  Our thriving partnership with other countries shall continue to be fostered and enhanced. Thailand’s international economic policy  including multilateral trade negotiations and free trade agreements  will be continued. We will monitor our active role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and in the Asia Cooperation Dialogue. We will also continue to promote the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy  a subregional and self-reliant collective effort aimed at speeding up regional integration  and BIMSTEC (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation)  an organization devoted to economic and social cooperation  bridging the two sub-continents of South Asia and South-East Asia. Members of the General Assembly can  therefore  be assured of continuity in our foreign policy at all levels — bilateral  regional and multilateral.  The world today is weakened by misunderstanding and fear. We judge one another based on our perceptions  which often times are not accurate. Out of fear  we go to war to seek peace.  Instead of waging war  we should cultivate peace. We should learn to respect one another  starting from within one’s own family  community and workplace  and extending it to other societies  peoples of different races  religions and beliefs. Starting with ourselves  we should expand our circle of friendship and peace and do everything possible to spread the message of peace within our nations and around the world.  In this regard  Thailand commends various initiatives to bridge differences among peoples across cultures and civilizations. We welcome and support the Alliance of Civilizations and the Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation towards Peace in the Twenty-First Century. We encourage the strengthening and promotion of such initiatives in order to foster peace and lessen the possibility of armed conflict.  Each year  the United Nations spends more than 70 per cent of its $10 billion annual budget on peacekeeping and other field operations. This trend can be reversed only if the United Nations works harder to create a culture of prevention. Prevention is  in the long run  less costly than peacekeeping operations. In this regard  it is particularly encouraging that two important new bodies have been established to contribute to strengthening the United Nations role in conflict prevention.  The Peacebuilding Commission is expected to enable countries to recover after emerging from conflict and to sustain durable peace. The Human Rights Council holds out the hope of promoting a culture of human rights for all. It should play a role in helping to prevent situations of human rights violations from deteriorating and developing into armed conflicts. The Council’s success will be measured not by the number of resolutions it adopts  but by its real impact on the ground.  One of the most effective measures for prevention of armed conflict is development. Thailand is encouraged that the theme of the general debate this year  “Implementing a global partnership for development”  responds to the immediate need to ensure that development goals are achieved on the firm basis of a global partnership. Developed countries need to honour their commitments  particularly in their    06-53952 26  official development assistance to developing countries and least developed countries.  Sustainable development is  however  not about aid  it is about trade and opportunity. Developing countries must not be denied the opportunity to trade themselves out of poverty. The suspension of the Doha Round dealt a serious setback to hopes for a true partnership between the developed and developing worlds. A global partnership for development must ensure win-win conditions for rich and poor alike. We must redouble our efforts to ensure that development does not become a casualty of domestic interests.  Global partnership is also not limited to relationships among States. The work of the United Nations can never be at its best if it does not reflect the voices of peoples at the grass-roots level. The Organization must ensure a global partnership for development and engage partners at all levels. In this regard  Thailand commends the work of the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships and encourages it to carry out additional good work to assist developing countries  especially those in Africa  in attaining sustainable development. We also thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for having explored the possibility of engaging civil society and the private sector in the work of the United Nations. My delegation looks forward to more work being undertaken in this regard during the current session of the General Assembly.  As the Secretary-General pointed out in his report to the General Assembly this year  the United Nations is a network of capacities and a source of operational capacity. In order to maximize this potential  there is an urgent need to reform the United Nations Secretariat. Discussion on Secretariat and management reform has been occupying a large part of our time since the World Summit. I encourage Member States to cooperate closely to achieve the common goal of ensuring that this Organization works to serve peoples in all corners of the world  in a transparent and most effective manner.  To enable the United Nations to deliver its best potential as a network of capacities  we also need to ensure that the work of the United Nations at Headquarters and in the field is coherent and well coordinated. In this regard  Thailand looks forward enthusiastically to studying the report and recommendations of the High-Level Panel on UN System-wide Coherence. We need to ensure that efforts at the national  regional and international levels are coordinated and that they respond to needs on the ground. The work of regional commissions and organizations should feed into the work of the United Nations at Headquarters in such a way as to maximize their synergies.  The year 2005 was one of vision and commitments. Our leaders met at the World Summit and laid out their visions for a better world  underpinned by effective multilateralism and a more effective United Nations. We have spent most of 2006 mapping out details of the commitments laid out by our leaders. In addition to the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council  another welcome effort undertaken by the General Assembly this year was the recent adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  which provides a good example of political will at work. Thailand wishes to encourage Member States to exert even greater political will in order to permit the speedy conclusion of a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention.   Moreover  the importance of prevention in the fight against terrorism can never be overstressed. The causes of marginalization and extremism — including  in particular  a lack of development — definitely require the world’s priority attention and must be properly addressed.  In June  the General Assembly adopted a strong Political Declaration (resolution 60/262) — as a follow-up to the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS — aimed at significantly scaling up our efforts to achieve universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes  care  treatment and support for all those who need them by the year 2010. Because AIDS has killed more than 25 million people and orphaned 15 million children since the first cases of AIDS were reported 25 years ago  and because close to 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS  Member States must take those commitments seriously and translate them into concrete actions at the national level.  Although much has been accomplished since the World Summit  that is only the beginning; much more needs to be done. The year 2007 must be a year for action and implementation. When the United Nations was founded 60 years ago  it was our forefathers’   27 06-53952  aspiration that the peoples of the world would live free from want and fear and in dignity. Today  the United Nations continues to strive to achieve that noble goal. Maintaining peace and security  promoting development and promoting and protecting the human rights of peoples throughout the world are not the responsibility of any single nation; they are our shared responsibility. Each and every one of us must serve as an agent for change. We must serve as instruments for peace.  Finally  I would be remiss to end this statement without paying tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his decade of hard work and dedication serving in the most impossible job in the world  and for his entire career in the service of humanity. The Secretary-General’s shoes will be extremely hard to fill. Anyone who is elected to serve in that post will have a full agenda on his hands: ensuring that multilateralism works effectively and that the United Nations remains relevant.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations  comprising Brunei Darussalam  Cambodia  Indonesia  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Malaysia  Myanmar  the Philippines  Singapore  Thailand and Viet Nam  has endorsed and supported the candidature of Mr. Surakiart Sathirathai of Thailand to carry on the work of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Mr. Surakiart’s vast background in Government  business and the academic world would enrich the work of the Organization. As someone from a developing country  Mr. Surakiart could serve as a bridge-builder  linking the North with the South  and could be a voice of moderation for the world community. In addition to the fact that he is an Asian candidate  Mr. Surakiart possesses outstanding personal qualifications. If he is elected  his experiences could be of great use to the work of the United Nations in the challenging times ahead. "
"169",6826,"TJK",61,2006,"It gives me great pleasure to join in the warm congratulations to Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa upon her assumption of the office of President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. We are confident that her extensive professional and life experience will be instrumental in addressing the issues faced by the General Assembly.  Tajikistan also welcomes the accession of Montenegro to the United Nations. On this occasion  on behalf of the Government of our country  I would like to extend our sincere congratulations to the Government and people of that friendly State.  A year has passed since the historic Summit confirmed the common views of the international community on the key issues of our time and on the United Nations as the universal international Organization whose goals and objectives are focused on the collective search for answers to the questions of concern to the entire international community. The leaders of our States declared that only strict compliance with the United Nations Charter  a comprehensive collective approach and mutual trust can ensure international security and development. The latest developments in the Middle East have proved once again the need to enhance the coordinating role of the United Nations in addressing global and regional issues.  Tajikistan is in favour of further strengthening the United Nations and lends its overall support to the process of its ongoing reform. As for Security Council reform  it should be undertaken by consensus  with due consideration for the interests of all Member States.  We believe that it was broad consensus that made possible such major accomplishments as the holding of the first session of the Human Rights Council  the launching of the Democracy Fund and the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund. Of special importance was the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  whose objective is also to sustain peace and development in post-conflict countries.   The Government of Tajikistan was among those that actively advocated the establishment of an efficient United Nations body of that kind — one that would focus on issues of coordination and targeted support for countries emerging from armed conflict. Tajikistan’s painful but ultimately successful transition from civil war to peace convincingly demonstrated the need for an international peacebuilding agency to assist the Security Council and other United Nations bodies    06-53341 12  in their efforts to accelerate the rehabilitation of countries emerging from crisis and to create guarantees for the non-recurrence of such conflicts.  Stable peace prevails in Tajikistan today  and national accord and respect for political pluralism have been achieved. The complex process of establishing democracy is under way  and all political forces involved are aware of their ever-increasing responsibility for the fate of our country. In compliance with the Constitution and valid legal procedures  new effective Government institutions are being successfully built. Respect for the law is increasingly the rule rather than the exception. Civil society is developing at an accelerated pace. Citizens determine their own destiny through active participation in the life of the State. The forthcoming presidential elections  scheduled for November 2006  will be an important milestone on the road towards peace and will open a new page in the history of the establishment of Tajik statehood.  In Tajikistan  as in the majority of United Nations Member States  the issue of sustainable development ranks among our top priorities. Today  we are fully aware of how instrumental the United Nations agenda has been in enhancing sustainable development and eradicating poverty  epidemics  famine and illiteracy the world over. At the same time  the implementation of a large-scale programme to achieve the Millennium Development Goals will require not only extra effort  but also considerable financing. In that regard  we expect tangible results from the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development.  In that connection  we highly value the outcome of the United Nations High-level Dialogue recently held in New York  which helped States concerned with issues of migration to reach constructive mutual understanding. Migration has been an issue of vital importance to our country since the outbreak of the civil war  when a part of the Tajik population had to leave the country. I would like to emphasize the special role and capacity of the United Nations in strengthening international cooperation in the field of migration and development. In this regard  Tajikistan is resolved to achieve as much progress as possible in implementing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In recent years  tangible progress has been achieved in the implementation of a number of goals  and the foundation has been laid for enhancing efforts in this area.  But long-term stability in Central Asia in the years to come is inseparable from the development of regional integration.   Currently  vast opportunities are emerging in the Central Asian region for the implementation of large-scale economic projects  the creation of a unified market of commodities and services and the establishment of conditions for attracting capital investment. Potential foreign investors see Central Asia as a single entity; and  primarily  as a common market.  Economic integration will become a powerful factor in the sustainable development of the region and will bring about the reduction of poverty and the improvement of well-being. For this reason  Tajikistan will continue to stand for strengthening of ties and the expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation among the States of the region.  The current positive processes in Afghanistan also create favourable conditions for regional cooperation in implementing transportation and communication projects which will provide the region with access to the southern seaports. The creation of new multi-modal transport corridors and the revival of the Great Silk Road routes will form a unified interconnected system of communications and make it possible for Central Asian States to gain access to promising markets.  It is also obvious that in many respects the attainment of the MDGs depends on assistance rendered by the international community to developing countries. Tajikistan joins the request addressed to the donor community to at least double the amount of assistance provided for the purposes of long-term development. The process of exchanging the debts of developing countries for national projects in the field of sustainable development remains an urgent issue.  One of our planet’s major assets is the fresh water indispensable for sustaining life. Our common goal in this respect is to develop qualitatively new patterns for the sustainable management of water resources and for addressing water-related economic issues at the national  regional and international levels. This can be achieved through a combination of appropriate support from the international community and national efforts    13 06-53341  with the leading role being played by countries and regions faced with the water-resource problems.  In this regard  Tajikistan hopes for the continued active involvement of the Member States in the activities of the International Decade for Action  “Water for Life”  2005-2015  including the successful holding of the International Freshwater Forum in Dushanbe in 2010. In order to coordinate activities in this area the Government of Tajikistan is establishing the National Water Committee. It will monitor progress and develop effective ways of attaining the goals of the water Decade at the national  regional and global levels through cooperation with the countries and international organizations concerned. Our efforts in the area of water are part and parcel of the strategic programme for the attainment of the MDGs.  It is well known that international terrorism  transnational organized crime and illegal drug trafficking obstruct sustainable development. Tajikistan believes that the United Nations and its Security Council provide a unique opportunity for the development and implementation of joint measures to confront international terrorism and the narcotics threat. We entirely support the report of the Secretary-General entitled “Uniting against terrorism: recommendations for a global counter-terrorism strategy”  and we view the outlined principles for confronting new challenges and risks as major instruments for counteracting those threats.  The response of the international community to the complex strategic threat of terrorism must also be comprehensive. The community of nations must intensify its efforts to counteract the instigation of acts of terror  the spread of terrorism ideology  extremism and separatism  religious and ethnic intolerance and hostility  and the financing of terrorism.  Universalizing and improving an international legal framework to counter terrorism remains an urgent issue. The speedy approval of the draft comprehensive convention on international terrorism will serve the interests of all countries and peoples in the United Nations community. Tajikistan will continue to support the strengthening of the United Nations as the core institution in this area.  The global system for counteracting terrorism currently being shaped cannot be established without the involvement of regional and subregional organizations. This should be taken into account when adopting measures aimed at combating any manifestations of extremism and violence at the regional and global levels. We regard participation of regional structures in this process as one of the major prerequisites for ensuring collective security. Among the structures of this nature in our region are the Commonwealth of Independent States  the Collective Security Treaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.  We believe that long-term success in combating terrorism and religious extremism depends on the elimination of the deep-rooted causes of these negative phenomena  generated by social and economic problems in the society. Prevention of illegal drug trafficking  which  to a certain extent  serves as a breeding ground for terrorism and international crime  must become part and parcel of our common struggle against terrorism. In this regard I would like to reiterate that Tajikistan is prepared to continue a constructive dialogue and cooperation with the aim of establishing an efficient global partnership to counteract the narcotics threat.  It must be said that current efforts at counteracting the narcotics threat are not sufficiently effective. For this reason  we believe that financial and technical assistance to Afghanistan  to be rendered within targeted programmes  and the creation of a modern  efficient and capable Afghan border service to safeguard the external borders  including the Afghan-Tajik border  would be a worthy application of the efforts of the international community in this area. Also  within the anti-narcotics partnership  we suggest enhanced interaction with the Afghan structures with the purpose of adopting joint measures to prevent drug trafficking across the Afghan-Tajik border. We are convinced that these measures could serve as a basis for the proposed establishment of the first section of the security belt around Afghanistan. Involvement in the constructive process of Afghanistan’s neighbours and factoring in the regional aspects of the post-conflict rehabilitation of that country may well be key to the success of the efforts undertaken by the international community.  Today  the regional dimension becomes one of the key factors of long-term development. Broad and constructive regional economic cooperation in Central Asia  which possesses considerable natural resources  is of particular importance at the present juncture. We believe that achieving that goal could enable Central    06-53341 14  Asia to become self-sufficient in terms of energy  fuel and food supply and a dynamic  developing region of the world. Therefore  we believe that the achievement of the MDGs should hold a place in the new structure of global security currently being shaped  and become one of the tools for addressing new challenges and threats. Today  as never before  it is becoming increasingly obvious that a security policy needs to be integrated into development.  The scale of the challenges facing the international community dictates the need to further strengthen our Organization. There is no doubt that we must do everything we can to make the United Nations more effective in dealing with issues of international security. The collective approach should keep us from making hasty and emotional decisions  since we are dealing with the Organization responsible for collective security  sustainable development and protection of human rights. It is with the United Nations  despite some of its imperfections  that humanity places its hope for a peaceful and just world order  for tangible achievements in the fields of combating poverty and natural disasters. A responsible attitude towards the United Nations is in the interests of each and every Member State. "
"170",6848,"TKM",61,2006,"Allow me to express my sincere gratitude for the honour of speaking from this high rostrum and to convey on behalf of Turkmenistan’s President  Saparmurat Niyazov  the best wishes for peace  well-   06-53615 34  being and prosperity to all the peoples of all countries. Permit me also to congratulate Madam Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the lofty and responsible post of President and wish her success in guiding the fruitful work of the sixty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly.  Neutral Turkmenistan  which marks the fifteenth anniversary of its independence this year  builds its relations in the international arena upon the principles of equal rights and mutually beneficial cooperation with all States and international organizations. Cooperation with the United Nations holds a special place in Turkmenistan’s international relations. Turkmenistan welcomes constructive interaction among members of the community of nations in elaborating new and effective approaches aimed at preserving and maintaining security and stability in the world and at achieving the objectives of sustainable development of countries and peoples.  During the more than 10 years that have passed since the adoption by the General Assembly of the resolution on the permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan on 12 December 1995  our State has demonstrated in practice the fundamental nature of peace-loving and humanist principles that have formed the basis of Turkmenistan’s policy since the day it acquired its independence.  I would like to avail this opportunity to express  on behalf of Turkmenistan’s President  our appreciation to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his support of Turkmenistan’s foreign policy and for his tireless efforts for the welfare of the world.  Today we quite rightly can state that Turkmenistan  as a neutral State  has been unswervingly fulfilling its international obligations. Through its actions  our country demonstrates its adherence to peace  cooperation  non-accession to alliances and military blocs  non-interference in the internal affairs of other States  respect for their sovereignty and their right to their own paths of development.  It is on the basis of peace  humanism and mutual respect of interests that Turkmenistan approaches issues of international cooperation  giving top priority to interaction with the United Nations and its structures in the strategic areas of partnership. There is no disputing the fact that the United Nations has been and continues to be the largest and most prestigious international Organization that has been entrusted with the coordinating role in world affairs and on which humankind pins its hopes for peaceful development.  Turkmenistan welcomes efforts by the United Nations  the General Assembly and the Security Council aimed at achieving goals of sustainable development  as well as meeting the challenges set by the 2005 Summit  which determined how the world community should address the most pressing problems affecting stability  humanitarian issues and strengthening and improving the work of the United Nations.  We believe that the tangible results of the collective efforts aimed at finding the best ways for the United Nations to proceed include such practical steps as the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission  creation of the Human Rights Council and other constructive steps. Improvement in the work of the Security Council is clearly one of the most important elements in completing the reform of the Organization. We firmly believe that it is essential to carry out this task; it is made necessary because of the objective processes of international development  increasing interaction among States and increased need for combining regional and global problems.  The United Nations is the most important international structure  where comprehensive account has to be taken of all factors underlying the processes in the world. Turkmenistan advocates strengthening the role of the United Nations and its major bodies  when decisions concerning the most pressing problems of today are taken.  In this context  our country supports expansion of Security Council membership on the basis of the greatest possible agreement among United Nations Member States. We also support initiating more effective and constructive dialogue between the Security Council and the General Assembly. We believe that progress will continue in the reforms started at the United Nations. Turkmenistan also welcomes expansion of the number of States represented in United Nations structures and institutions  while emphasizing the importance of geographical distribution; this is in line with the basic values of our Organization.  Turkmenistan’s steadfast position is that it favours strengthening the United Nations in the international arena as the highest international forum   35 06-53615  for establishing a just and humane world order. Turkmenistan fundamentally advocates increasing the peacebuilding potential of the Organization  in accordance with the realities of global development. Therefore  our country devotes great attention to maintaining most close contacts with offices of United Nations specialized agencies  whose importance is continually growing today.  One of Turkmenistan’s main achievements since independence has been the primacy of the principle whereby each nation has the right to chose its own path of development and acceptable form of State system. This is an essential condition for stability and sustainable and progressive development in all spheres of society. Today  independent and neutral Turkmenistan is confidently advancing along its chosen path. Annually  our country’s economic growth surpasses 20 per cent  with the volume of production per capita exceeding $8 000.  Turkmenistan is celebrating its 15th anniversary as a State that has guaranteed its own food independence. It provides its people with free natural gas  electricity  water  salt and low  in fact  symbolic prices for bread  utilities and public transport services  gasoline and so forth. All this is a tangible result of the long-term programme of social and economic reform carried out in our country under the leadership of the Head of the nation. Under this programme  over 60 per cent of the State budget is allocated to social spending.  As a democratic State based on the rule of law  Turkmenistan is unwaveringly implementing the highest principles allowing people to express their will. In this regard  the Turkmen people possess a vast historical experience of democratic traditions  which are organically and progressively finding their way today into the social and political life of the country and are reflected in the continual enjoyment by citizens of their constitutional rights and freedoms. In this respect  2006 was a significant year for Turkmenistan. In accordance with the decision of the highest representative body of Government  the People’s Council  our country held elections to local self-government on an open  democratic and competitive basis. As of now  this practice is being implemented at other levels of Government. In this  we see the basis for consistent and irreversible processes of democratization  with the ever-increasing involvement of citizens and public organizations in managing the country. In Turkmenistan  this process is advancing in a natural way  thereby instilling in the people the sense that they are masters of their land and that they are responsible for their destiny and the destiny of their country.  In terms of preserving peace and security  non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one of the most acute problems on today’s global agenda. Our country fully supports efforts by the world community in this area and participates in their implementation  both at the national and international levels. We are taking concrete  practical steps in this direction.  It should be especially emphasized that  at the end of October 2005  the People’s Council of Turkmenistan adopted a Declaration in support of the initiatives of international organizations against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Also  on 8 September  Turkmenistan  together with other States of the region  signed a treaty creating a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia.  By these actions  our country is demonstrating in practice its firm commitment to the processes of disarmament and non-proliferation. In this connection we pledge our readiness to implement the initiative of the President of Turkmenistan — which was supported by the United Nations Secretary-General — to establish a United Nations regional centre for preventive diplomacy in Central Asia. All the necessary conditions and appropriate infrastructure are already available in the capital of our State — Ashgabat.  The President returned to the Chair.  Turkmenistan has demonstrated its existing potential and capabilities through its active cooperation with the United Nations in organizing major international forums and conferences to discuss pressing problems involving global and regional issues.  Through practical multilateral dialogue we have become convinced that the prevention of potential conflicts requires early warning of emerging situations  a broad-based analysis and elaboration of preventive strategies. Therefore  Turkmenistan will continue to make its contribution to improving multilateral cooperation in this important area in partnership with the United Nations and its organs  while recognizing the great importance of international experience in preventive diplomacy.    06-53615 36   Turkmenistan is a principled and determined participant in the struggle against the threat of terrorism. We regard terrorism in all its forms as a phenomenon that must be placed outside the framework of human civilization. We are convinced that in order to combat terrorism today we need the cooperation of all States  including with regard to such important issues as cooperation in the search for and extradition of the organizers and participants of terrorist acts  as well as their collaborators.  Turkmenistan fully supports the efforts of the Secretary-General in elaborating a global strategy in the fight against terrorism and stands ready to provide practical assistance to the international community in its efforts in that direction.  The United Nations is a unique reflection of actual changes occurring in the world and it has clearly demonstrated the will and desire of States for cooperation within a stable environment. The strategic direction of reforms and the chosen path towards qualitative improvement in the work of the community of nations has become the defining vector of those changes.  Turkmenistan views the reform of the United Nations as a road map towards the further strengthening and enhancement of its authority. We are convinced that the United Nations has always been and remains the most universal international structure and the most important guarantor of global stability  security and development. Turkmenistan will continue to cooperate more closely with the United Nations in the future with a view to helping it to fully display its enormous potential. "

Your experience and diplomatic ability will ensure the success of this session.  I would also like to congratulate your predecessor  His Excellency Jan Eliasson of Sweden  for the critical role he played in the reform of the United Nations  including the establishment of the Human Rights Council and Peacebuilding Commission.  I would also like to extend my congratulations to permanent representatives and experts  for their positive contributions during the long and arduous negotiations. I take this opportunity to also congratulate His Excellency the Ambassador of Angola  Mr. Ismael Gaspar Martins  for his election as President of the Peacebuilding Commission.  Allow me to extend the congratulations of the people and Government of Timor-Leste to the people and Government of Montenegro on their new membership at the United Nations.  At the outset of this sixty-first session  a great son of Africa and of the world  His Excellency Kofi Annan  delivered his last report as Secretary-General of our Organization. In the complicated international landscape of the past 10 years  he and his team contributed significantly to the advancement of the noble ideals of the United Nations in the world  including his decisive contribution to the independence and liberation of my country  Timor-Leste.  Our people will never forget his decisive support and we wish much success to him and to Mrs. Nane Annan  whom we honour for her contribution to the strengthening the role of women in the world and for the compassion shown to those who suffer.  In July of this year  the Prime Minister of the Constitutional Government  Mari Alkatiri  resigned from his post and a new Government  under the leadership of Prime Minister José Ramos-Horta  was sworn in.  Since our independence in May 2002 and until July of this year  significant gains were made in the establishment of the institutions of the State and in the creation of basic conditions to facilitate investment  both national and international.  The new Prime Minister  in his speech to the National Parliament  reiterated his determination to implement the following policies — reconciliation; the consolidation of security and reform of defence and security institutions; parliamentary and presidential elections before May 2007; the reduction of poverty  economic growth and investment in rural areas; good governance; the finalization of the land border demarcation between the Republic of Indonesia and Timor-Leste; and ratification of the agreement with Australia  known as “Greater Sunrise”.   The Government will continue to implement the national development plan  which was initiated by the first Constitutional Government  and will do all it can to attain the Millennium Development Goals as outlined at the Summit in 2000.    06-53952 16   In relation to political affairs  the Government  in conjunction with the Presidency  the National Parliament  the political parties  the religious institutions  civil society and traditional society  will hold a national dialogue to recapture the confidence in our State institutions that was lost.  Only yesterday  the Head of Government  Mr. Ramos-Horta  met with the representatives of the armed forces who had been dismissed — now referred to as “the petitioners” — to once again find a solution that is in conformity with the laws of Timor-Leste and that is acceptable to the various parties involved in the situation.  The Government of Timor-Leste is determined to proceed with the reform of the security and defence institutions  namely Falintil-FDTL and the National Police Force of Timor-Leste.  The National Police Force  an institution whose mandate it is to promote law and order  disintegrated partially during the recent crisis. A first group of 25 members of the Police Force resumed duty this week under a mentoring scheme run by the United Nations Police in Timor-Leste. The reconstitution of the National Police Force as a professional  non-partisan police force is critical to stability.  As political leaders of a young nation  we acknowledge that not every decision made was right and that some decisions created discontent and were part of the cause of the demonstrations in April  May  June and July of this year.  We are all interested in carrying out a profound and honest reflection on the causes of this crisis. The President of the Republic  Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão  the Prime Minister  Mr. José Ramos-Horta  together with leaders of the Catholic Church and other religious denominations  will co-organize a national conference based on our culture and traditional values  in which various actors  including civil and traditional society  will participate. (spoke in English)  As a post-conflict country  we have recently experienced a relapse of violence owing to institutional failures of our defence and police forces  high levels of unemployment and wrong political decisions that we took as leaders of a new country. As a result of the violence  we had almost 150 000 internally displaced persons and almost 100 dead. Consequently  the President of the Republic  Mr. Xanana Gusmão  the President of the Parliament  Mr. Francisco Guterres Lu-Olo  and Prime Minister of the first Constitutional Government  Mari Alkatiri  had to request international help. Immediately  our closest neighbours  the United Nations  members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP)  and members of the Pacific Islands Forum extended their support in a variety of ways.   We would like to take this opportunity to thank Indonesia  Malaysia  Portugal  Australia  New Zealand  Japan  China  the United States of America  Korea  Kuwait  the CPLP  the European Union and Cuba  and many other countries  for their invaluable support during the recent crisis in Timor-Leste.   We also welcome the establishment of the Independent Special Commission of Inquiry for Timor-Leste by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to study the events surrounding the crisis and the allegations of human rights abuses. We commend the members of the Security Council for their support in the creation of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) pursuant to Security Council resolution 1704 (2006). We praise all United Nations and other international agencies currently based in Timor-Leste. Without their support  our response to the humanitarian crisis would not have been as successful as it is today.   The Government is fully aware that reconciliation and justice need to work hand in hand with development. This fiscal year’s budget was increased by 122 per cent. It focuses on job creation  not only in towns  but fundamentally in rural areas  where the majority of our population lives. It is a budget for the poor. We hope that this new economic policy  combined with the policies of reconciliation and dialogue  will help defuse the tension and will build common understanding and reinvigorate trust and confidence in our common and shared future.  As in difficult times in the past  we are determined to succeed and restore to the people of Timor-Leste the stability and peace that we need to develop our country and improve the living conditions of our people.   To achieve these goals  we also need the support of the United Nations and the international community at large to help organize and supervise the upcoming legislative and presidential elections in our country. A   17 06-53952  free  transparent and fair election will definitely pave the way for a stable political and social environment.   In the international arena  we have seen an increase in violence  war and intolerance. Last week  in this Assembly  on 21 September  the President of the Palestinian Authority  Mr. Mahmoud Abbas  made a strong appeal to the international community to not let the olive branch fall from his hand. The international community needs to continue its strong support for the forces of peace and moderation in Palestine and for the President of the Palestinian Authority. The international community also needs to engage the elected Palestinian Government in order to find ways to guarantee a free and democratic Palestine living side by side with the State of Israel in peace and harmony.  After many years of conflict and violence  the people of Lebanon need a peaceful environment. We hope that the arrival of United Nations forces will help protect that country’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity.  In Darfur  Sudan  we require the sustained attention of the international community in order to bring to the people of Sudan the peace and stability they need.   With respect to Western Sahara  we believe that a dialogue between the Government of Morocco and the leaders of the Polisario Front will help lead to a solution in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions.   As a small country  we believe that multilateralism  dialogue  negotiations  democracy  human rights  respect for the Charter of the United Nations  and respect for each others’ culture and religious values  are the best answers for today’s challenges and intolerance. We will continue to support all initiatives  such as interfaith cooperation and dialogue among civilizations.   After the Monterrey  Mexico  conference  in March 2002  many initiatives were taken to increase the financial resources of developing countries  one of which was the Millennium Challenge Account. This year Timor-Leste was selected as a threshold country  and we are working with Millennium Challenge Corporation members with a view to benefiting from the grant funds.  We commend President George W. Bush  his Administration  our friends in the House of Representatives and Senate and the people of the United States of America for that great initiative. It will definitely help to reduce poverty and promote development in our country and in other countries in the developing world.  We also commend the European Union and its Commission President  Mr. Durão Barroso  for its continuing support for developing countries  including Timor-Leste.  As a least developed country and a member of the Group of 77 and China  we share the common view that the allocation of 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product of developed countries to official development assistance is crucial  not only for development in the South  but also so as to maintain stability  peace and progress in the world.  We would also like to welcome the recent initiative of Brazil and France to tax air travel in order to provide additional funds for financing development.  In conclusion  I would like to say a few words in our national language  Tetum. (spoke in Tetum; English text provided by the delegation)  We would like to reiterate our thanks to all of you  your peoples and your Governments for your support during the crisis. I pray to God to continue to protect you  your Governments and your peoples. "
"172",6877,"TON",61,2006,"The Tongan delegation joins others in congratulating you  Madam  on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. Let us reassure you of Tonga’s full support and its confidence that the sixty-first session of the General Assembly will be productive and successful under your very able leadership. Full recognition is also in order for the excellent work of your predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly. In the same vein  the Tongan delegation takes this opportunity to commend and extend its gratitude to the outgoing Secretary-General  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan  for his tireless service over the past 10 years in the stewardship of the Organization.  It has been a year since our leaders met at the historic World Summit in an effort to embrace the realities of the world we live in and to duly reflect those challenges in the work of the Organization. We are pleased that there are specific landmarks that attest to the fact that some progress has been made in the implementation of the 2005 Outcome Document (resolution 60/1). They include the inauguration of the Peacebuilding Commission  coupled with the establishment of the Peacebuilding Support Office and the Peacebuilding Fund; the creation of the Human Rights Council; and the establishment of the Central Emergency Response Fund.  Mr. Chidyausiku (Zimbabwe)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  Tonga also welcomes the adoption of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)  which forms a basis upon which we can build our consistent and unequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations — committed by whomever  whenever and for whatever purpose — for terrorism constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security. We look forward to the effective implementation of the Strategy  as well as to the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism during the sixty-first session of the General Assembly.  Tonga also remains committed to supporting the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. We duly recognize the efforts undertaken to consolidate States’ reporting requirements. We also wish to acknowledge the cooperation provided by bilateral  regional and multilateral agencies in helping to fulfil international and regional commitments to combat transnational organized crime and to fight terrorism.  Tonga shares the call for the full restoration of the role of the General Assembly as the main decision-making  representative and policy-making body of the United Nations  in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. That would further enhance the credibility of multilateralism and the important need to address the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting the world.  Tonga supports the work pertaining to the remainder of the reform mandates  especially as    06-53958 4  regards Secretariat and management reforms  the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council and the strengthening and streamlining of management in the Organization.  The important issue of the reform of the Security Council still remains unresolved  although world leaders acknowledged that it was an essential element of our overall effort. Tonga supports the call by the Secretary-General in his annual report (A/61/1) to find common ground for action on this fundamental piece of overall United Nations reform  as well as his urging that a decision on Council reform be taken sooner rather than later in order to ensure that the United Nations machinery to promote the establishment and maintenance of peace and security will remain relevant and credible to meet today’s and tomorrow’s challenges. Tonga continues to support Japan’s assumption of its proper and permanent place in any enhanced Council.   Tonga commends the contributions of United Nations peacekeepers in fulfilling the Organization/s vital role in helping parties in conflict to end hostilities. To the degree that it is able  Tonga is committed to supporting both international and regional peacekeeping efforts  including the current Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands.  For many island developing countries  including my own  the development agenda remains a top priority. In that regard  the theme of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly  “Implementing a global partnership for development”  is not only very pertinent but also very timely. While we reiterate that we take primary responsibility for our own development  we continue to welcome as a necessary step the maintenance and enhancement of support at the regional and international levels to complement our national efforts. That includes the support provided under the Pacific Plan to strengthen regional cooperation and integration  which was endorsed by Pacific leaders in 2005  as well as the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.  Tonga looks forward to progress in the work to enhance mechanisms to promote coherent United Nations support to small island developing States through a strengthened inter-agency consultative process  the finalization of a strategy for resource mobilization and the promotion of partnership initiatives.  In May of this year  His Majesty’s Government ratified its Strategic Development Plan 8  entitled “Looking to the future  building on the past”  which sets out the Government’s road map for the Kingdom’s future development path for the period 2006-2007 to 2008-2009. The document was formulated following a lengthy and extensive process of consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders. It provides due recognition to the fact that the success of the implementation of the Development Plan will require the efforts of both State and non-State actors.  The President of the General Assembly has rightly observed that the recent historic High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development revealed the potential and opportunities that globalization presents as a force for improving the lives of millions of people. The meeting provided Tonga  a mature migration-remittance economy  with the opportunity to showcase the important nexus between migration and development.  A study recently produced by the World Bank concluded that  for Tonga  recipient household migration and remittances have positive impacts on migrant-sending countries through improved income distribution and poverty alleviation  induced higher savings and stimulated business activities  resulting in larger investments in education. The study also highlighted that improved and restricted  but organized  labour mobility can significantly contribute to a country’s gross domestic product and to overall global income. Labour mobility is therefore a potential vehicle for achieving our commitment to pro-poor strategies such as the Millennium Development Goals and other commitments  and also for achieving national sustainable development strategies.  The suspension of the Doha round of trade talks was disappointing. The failure to conclude the talks will negatively affect global economic prospects and the growth of low-income countries  including Tonga. We join others in urging World Trade Organization member countries to maintain their commitment to the rules-based multilateral trading system  preserve progress that has been achieved and to continue with the negotiations. We also continue to urge the donor community to move forward with the delivery of aid   5 06-53958  for trade  independent of the Doha round. Regional cooperation on trade-related projects has the potential to promote the competitiveness of low-income countries  such as the island economies of the Pacific.  In October 2005  Tonga’s Legislative Assembly passed a motion to establish a National Committee of the Kingdom of Tonga on Political Reform. With the support of His Majesty’s Government  the Committee chaired by His Late Royal Highness Prince Tu’ipelehake has completed public meetings and consultations throughout Tonga as well as in the countries where the majority of Tongans reside  namely  New Zealand  Australia and the United States of America. It is anticipated that the report will be deliberated upon by the Legislative Assembly during its 2006 session and by His Majesty’s Government with a view to attaining an appropriate political reform agenda that is not only responsive but also responsible for fulfilling the objectives of building national unity and promoting the social and economic advancement of the people of Tonga. "
"173",6917,"TTO",61,2006,"It is indeed an honour for me to express to you  Madam  sincere congratulations on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. Your appointment as the third woman ever to hold that esteemed position is of special significance and must be duly recognized. Trinidad and Tobago is convinced that your extensive experience in multilateral diplomacy and your international legal expertise adequately equip you to guide the work of the Assembly to a successful conclusion.  We also take this opportunity to welcome most warmly the Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of the United Nations and to wish its people and its Government continued peace  stability and prosperity.  We would also like to recognize the astute and efficient leadership of the President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  who efficiently  dispassionately and with subtle dexterity discharged the mandate of follow-up entrusted to the sixtieth session by our leaders at the 2005 World Summit  getting us past hurdles that challenged to the core the working methods of the Assembly. His efforts also enabled the international community to create two crucial new international institutions — the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission — as part of the ongoing reform of the United Nations.  Trinidad and Tobago is hopeful that the Human Rights Council will be an effective instrument for the defence and promotion of human rights worldwide  denouncing without fear or favour gross violations of human rights and seeking  through dialogue and cooperation  to bring about full compliance with internationally accepted norms related to universal fundamental human rights and freedoms.  Institutional support for countries in transition from the post-conflict phase to that of sustainable development is a sine qua non for the success of efforts to restore peace and normalcy. It is in that context that Trinidad and Tobago views the indispensable role to be played by the Peacebuilding Commission in those countries that have been traumatized by years of internal strife.  His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan is a very special friend of Trinidad and Tobago — and  might I confide  especially of Tobago. It is thus with mixed emotions that we bid him farewell at this session. Over the course of his tenure  our seemingly unassuming Secretary-General has steered the vessel that is the Organization with an abundance of skill and with clarity of vision  keeping it on an even keel as it has traversed one of the most turbulent periods in its    06-53952 28  history. He has been a champion of principle  a spokesman for international justice and the staunchest defender of all that the Organization stands for and to which all of our countries subscribe. There is so much that the Secretary-General has done that history will record. For us  it suffices that he has been the beacon that has kept the United Nations ideal alive during these difficult times.  The role of the Secretary-General in the twenty-first century is no longer that of a mere chief administrative officer — burdensome as that role may be — but one that requires profound knowledge of the dynamics of current inter-State relations. Trinidad and Tobago is hopeful  therefore  that as we elect a successor to Secretary-General Kofi Annan  the Security Council will recommend to the General Assembly a person whose diplomatic skills are highly regarded  whose leadership abilities are well recognized and who will be able to maintain an excellent working relationship with all Member States and enjoy the confidence of the five permanent members of the Security Council  thereby facilitating decisive and timely actions by the Organization when they are most urgently needed.  However  the functions of the Secretary-General can be carried out effectively only with the firm support of the entire international community. It is therefore vital that the process through which the chosen candidate will emerge be as inclusive and transparent as possible and that it remain faithful to the principles and procedures enshrined in the Charter as they relate to his or her appointment.  The international community continues to grapple with the absence of realistic and pragmatic solutions to many longstanding global problems. A just and lasting peace in the Middle East continues to elude us  and the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people continues to worsen daily in view of the economic and financial stranglehold placed on their economy following the assumption of power by democratic means of the political grouping of their choice. We urge the major political parties in the Palestinian territories to find common ground that would satisfy the aspirations of the Palestinian people  who for generations have longed to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.  Peace and security in the Middle East also remain threatened by conflicts of a more recent vintage. The use of force disproportionate to the threat at hand  as in the recent cases of Gaza and Lebanon  has also had the effect of increasing the suffering of the civilian populations concerned and of destroying vital national infrastructure  and has served only to increase bitterness and hatred among those populations and to inspire resort to extremism.  Trinidad and Tobago also views with growing alarm the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Darfur region of the Sudan and calls upon the international community to exercise its responsibility to protect the people of Darfur. The international community has a fundamental legal and moral obligation to act in cases of egregious violations of human rights such as this. It is incumbent on us to institute immediate measures to provide security and alleviate the suffering. We must also bring to justice at the International Criminal Court (ICC) those responsible for the crimes against humanity committed in Darfur.  Trinidad and Tobago exhorts the Government in Khartoum to accept the presence of a United Nations-mandated peacekeeping force that would enhance the capacity to monitor the Darfur Peace Agreement. Such a force could also provide the necessary security for the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons living in makeshift camps and for the return of refugees from neighbouring Chad  and would facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance.  On another front  Trinidad and Tobago applauds the efforts of the International Criminal Court and welcomes with satisfaction the progress made to bring to justice the perpetrators of the heinous crimes committed against the peoples of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Trinidad and Tobago views universal adherence to the ICC as integral to entrenching the rule of law in the conduct of international relations  and as yet another pillar of the promotion of international peace and security. We again urge States Members of this Organization that are not yet party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to consider acceding to that instrument as soon as possible.  The well-being of peoples the world over is threatened not only by violations of international humanitarian and human rights law  but also by individual and collective acts of terrorism which the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago   29 06-53952  resolutely condemns. We are  indeed  hopeful that the recent adoption by the Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy will lead to a holistic and integral approach to a phenomenon that threatens the internal peace and security of States in virtually all regions of the globe. It is also our sincere hope that this body will  in the near future  conclude its deliberations on a comprehensive international convention against terrorism that would provide a legal framework for combating that scourge — a framework acceptable to all nations.  It has become something of a cliché to say that there will be no peace and security in the world without development and  conversely  no development without security. It was therefore with a degree of concern that we witnessed the near-total relegation to secondary status of the development dimension of the international agenda at the 2005 millennium review Summit. Some degree of relief was provided subsequently when  after long and arduous negotiations  we were able to agree on a development resolution that sought — on the basis of a global partnership  among other things — to operationalize and implement the development commitments made at the major summits in the economic  social and related fields.  That resolution also provided for monitoring mechanisms to follow up on the commitments of the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization. Trinidad and Tobago is hopeful that the commitments to the achievement of those international development objectives  as set out in that resolution  will be honoured and will not be the subject of renegotiation at the next review.  Global peace and security are also threatened by the failure of the international community to bring about the necessary structural changes in the fields of international trade and in economic and financial relations. Like most developing countries  Trinidad and Tobago is painfully aware of the significant imbalances that have been having an adverse impact on developing economies. The current suspension of the Doha trade negotiations  and the delay in the resumption of those talks  are consequently of particular concern to us  given the outward-looking orientation of our economy and the fact that the most basic tenet of our trade policy relates to increased market access for the export of our goods and services.  Trinidad and Tobago therefore joins with other small vulnerable economies in calling for a process that would accelerate the recommencement of negotiations  while ensuring that adequate treatment is afforded to the development dimension. It is crucial that global trade rules be enhanced in recognition of the need for treatment to be accorded to small  vulnerable economies that takes their special circumstances into consideration and allows them to participate in world trade in a manner commensurate with their national capacity to do so.  Even as our economies grapple with the systemic imbalances in the international trading system at home  Trinidad and Tobago  like many other Caribbean countries  faces social challenges that have global implications. One such challenge manifests itself in the increasing resort to gun violence by our young people and by others engaged in the nefarious drug trade. The countries of the Caribbean region are not producers of small arms and light weapons  yet small arms are increasingly visible in our societies and raise the fatality levels resulting from the commission of many serious crimes.  Much of the illicit trade in firearms and related activity in our Caribbean region is linked to the illicit traffic in drugs. Yet international cooperation — essential to help us stem the flow of illicit drugs through our countries  which are already recognized as key transit States — is not forthcoming from our development partners. Trinidad and Tobago accordingly urges the international community to provide the necessary resources to bolster Caribbean regional efforts aimed at interdicting drug shipments and putting an end to the flow of illicit firearms  which negatively and profoundly affect the security and development of the region.   It is well known that the living standards suggested by positive economic indicators are of little consequence if the basic security and sense of well-being of the individual is under threat. Similarly  the failure by the international community earlier this year at the Review Conference to reach broad agreement on additional measures to further implement the 2001 United Nations Programme of Action on Small Arms has been a source of disappointment to Trinidad and Tobago. We are heartened  however  that within the international community a broad understanding appears to be emerging regarding the utility of an international    06-53952 30  legally binding instrument to govern the international arms trade.  Trinidad and Tobago therefore strongly endorses the call by some States for the conclusion of such an instrument. We are also of the view that until such a treaty becomes a reality  it is imperative that the major producers and exporters of small arms and light weapons establish comprehensive export controls in order to ensure that such weapons are not diverted into the illicit trade.  Trinidad and Tobago’s approach to development places primary focus on enhancing the living standards and sense of well-being of the individual. Thus  even as we address major problems of a global nature  we should not forget those among us who face greater challenges in realizing their full potential. The international community has recently become increasingly sensitized to the difficulties faced in almost all spheres of activity by persons with disabilities  and during the sixtieth session of the General Assembly  we successfully negotiated a draft convention on the promotion and protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. Trinidad and Tobago joined in the adoption by consensus of the final negotiated text  and looks forward to its formal adoption by the Assembly and its subsequent opening for signature. We have in the interim developed  and are in the process of implementing  a national policy on persons with disabilities.  Another area that cries out for timely and decisive action by the international community is that of the environment. Our planet today continues to be ravaged by patterns of production and consumption that gravely threaten its sustainability and give rise to phenomena whose management consumes the already stretched energies and resources of small island developing States in particular. The challenges to those countries posed by such phenomena as climate change and sea-level rise  as well as the effort and resources necessary to recover from adverse seasonal weather patterns  add another dimension to the challenges that they already face in the area of economic and social development.   Trinidad and Tobago invokes that same spirit of partnership of the international community to work towards the full implementation of the Mauritius Strategy  that being the framework for the collective development of this vulnerable grouping.  In the midst of such daunting challenges  the littoral States of the Caribbean are faced with the constant threat of a maritime casualty resulting from the shipment of radioactive or other hazardous wastes through the Caribbean Sea. Such an occurrence could create the potential for an environmental disaster for all countries along the Caribbean coastline  but  in particular  it would threaten the economic well-being and livelihood of the many small island developing States of the Caribbean that depend on this fragile ecosystem.  Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that the integrated management approach of the recently conceived Caribbean Sea Initiative will be critical to advancing the development goals of the member States of the Caribbean and uses this opportunity to seek the support of all United Nations Member States for the Initiative  which seeks to ensure that the Caribbean Sea is recognized by the United Nations as a special area in the context of sustainable development.  Trinidad and Tobago is committed to the partnership approach in all areas of international interaction  be it for sustainable development  peace and security  human rights or humanitarian assistance. It is a position that informs a fierce defence of multilateralism in full recognition of the benefits of collective action and of the responsibility of each country to assist when in a position to do so within the limits of its resources. This thinking underlies the actions taken by Trinidad and Tobago in respect of the provision of economic and humanitarian assistance  both institutionally as well as directly  to countries in our region and to those further afield.  It is in this context that Trinidad and Tobago pledges its full support for the economic and social development of the Republic of Haiti in its return to constitutional governance  which has led to its readmission into the Caribbean Community Council and calls for the release of all donor funds that have already been pledged. The history of Haiti is of special significance in the struggle for independence in the Caribbean and is linked to other historical developments more international in scope. One such development was the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade  the 200th anniversary of which will be marked in 2007. The slave trade has had long-term effects on the social and economic development of parts of Africa that are still being felt today.   31 06-53952   Nor were we in the Caribbean spared the effects of the slave trade  and we are of the view that any call on the international community to mark this occasion should go beyond the need merely to reflect on the atrocities committed during this perverse period of our history. Trinidad and Tobago thus lends its support to the call made by countries of the African diaspora in the Caribbean and elsewhere for the commemoration by the United Nations in 2007 of the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade.  The United Nations is central to any resolution of the problems with which the international community is confronted in today’s world. It is only by having a strong United Nations  fully resourced by its Member Governments and imbued with the necessary political will  that we will be able to tackle these problems and provide this generation and succeeding generations with a life of dignity and free from daily degradation of the human spirit. We seek a life in peace and security and  free from the ravages of war  lived in good economic and social conditions  without poverty  illiteracy  hunger or disease.  This historical moment requires bold initiatives on the part of the General Assembly President  who  in tandem with the new Secretary-General  is called upon to provide the vision  courage and strength of conviction necessary to carry the United Nations forward along the path to confronting the myriad challenges facing the Organization in today’s world. We are confident that they will both be up to the task."
"174",6964,"TUN",61,2006,"Madam President  on the occasion of your election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  I am pleased to convey to you and to our brotherly country Bahrain my most sincere congratulations. We are convinced that your experience and competence will enrich the work of this session and will contribute to its success.   I should also like to take this opportunity to commend your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his constant efforts to implement the recommendations of the 2005 Summit related to the reform of the Organization and the adoption of the two resolutions creating the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission.  I take this opportunity to convey my special thanks to Mr. Kofi Annan  Secretary-General of the United Nations  for the valuable efforts he has been tirelessly making to enhance the Organization’s role and advance its performance  and for proving his capability to realize a consensus on several complex issues and to advance the reform of the Organization.  We note with satisfaction the important steps achieved since the 2005 Summit aimed at developing the Organization’s role and work for the sake of further efficiency in its action  which will contribute to anchoring the values of justice and moderation in international relations. While insisting on the need to confer more transparency on the Security Council and pursue efforts to reach consensus on its enlargement  which will ensure equitable representation of all international parties and allow the Council to perform its main functions in an environment of dialogue and consensus  we also call for strengthening the General Assembly’s prerogatives  revitalizing its role  and making it work more efficiently.  Tunisia  which had the honour of being among the first members of the Human Rights Council  reiterates its determination to participate actively in the work of this new United Nations institution and to contribute to achieving the noble objectives for which it was created  especially those related to respect for human rights in their global meaning  as agreed at the international level.  Our world today sees numerous rapid changes and developments in security  political  economic and social issues while time many international issues remain unresolved. Tunisia — which has supported the Middle East peace process since its inception and has always called for dialogue  negotiation and recourse to international legality — stresses again the need to find a just  lasting and comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict that will allow all the peoples of the region to live in peace and security. Taking into account the hardships and suffering that the fraternal Palestinian people are undergoing  such as the siege  Tunisia calls upon the international community to provide them with international protection urgently. Tunisia also renews its call for active parties  primarily the Quartet  to ensure appropriate conditions for reviving all tracks of the peace process in accordance with ongoing Arab efforts  to help the Palestinian people regain their legitimate national rights  including the establishment of their independent State and to allow sister States Syria and Lebanon to recover their occupied territories.  Tunisia reiterates its solidarity with Lebanon following the Israeli aggression  which caused destruction and huge loss of life and property  and renews its call on the international community to contribute to the reconstruction of Lebanon. In this regard  Tunisia commends the results of the recent Stockholm donor summit.   Tunisia also expresses the hope that the fraternal Iraqi people will find appropriate solutions to their national causes in the framework of the political process  in order to maintain national unity and guarantee security and stability  which will allow Iraqis to devote themselves to reconstruction.  To face the challenges on the international scene  especially the phenomenon of extremism and terrorism     06-53609 10  the international community must enhance its efforts and cooperation. Tunisia  which was among the first to warn against these dangers  renews its call for an international conference  under United Nations auspices  to elaborate an international code of conduct to combat terrorism to which all parties would be committed. Tunisia has also called for tackling all root causes of terrorism — mainly injustice  the policy of double standards  and economic and social conditions that generate frustration and marginalization — within the framework of a comprehensive approach.  To implement this approach  the international community adopted the Tunisian initiative to set up a world solidarity fund to fight poverty and exclusion and to lay the foundations for a more equitable and solidarity-based vision for development. We hope that all relevant parties will increase their efforts to provide the necessary financing to operate this mechanism.  Spreading the culture of tolerance  dialogue and respect for beliefs and religious symbols in all countries has today become one of the urgent necessities for reinforcing rapprochement  understanding and solidarity among peoples and for establishing constructive international relations based on moderation and respect for the specificities and civilizations of peoples and on rejection of violence  extremism and intolerance.   In this regard  and based on its firm belief in those principles  Tunisia proposed several initiatives  such as the adoption of the Carthage Charter for Tolerance in 1995  the appeal of His Excellency the President of the Republic  Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  for a pedagogy of tolerance  the proclamation of the 2001 Tunis Declaration on Dialogue among Civilizations  and the establishment of the Ben Ali Chair for Dialogue among Civilizations and Religions.  In spite of all the efforts made  achieving the Millennium Development Goals faces difficulties that require more collective efforts by all components of the international community  especially economically strong and developed countries  in the field of financing the development of the countries of the South and speeding up the transfer of technology to them. With regard to efforts to reinforce resources for developing countries  Tunisia again appeals for further action to relieve the debt burden of the least developed countries and to recycle those of middle-income countries by transforming them into investments in development projects considered to be a priority by those countries.  Convinced that the digital divide is one of the main challenges to development  Tunisia initiated the call for a world summit on the information society under the auspices of the United Nations. In November 2005 it was honoured to host the second phase of this summit  which produced important results and laid the foundations for a new world vision aimed at reducing the digital divide between countries and establishing the bases of a society of knowledge by adopting the Tunis Agenda and the Tunis Commitment. We are confident that the results of that summit will benefit from appropriate consideration and follow-up by the United Nations and its specialized agencies  as will all stakeholders in information technology and communication.  Tunisia has directed all its capabilities to elevating itself to the level of an advanced country within a future-oriented vision  the foundations of which were laid by President Ben Ali. That vision includes all political  economic  social and developmental domains. It materialized in a set of deep reforms that led to the reinforcement of democracy  promotion of a culture of human rights at both conceptual and concrete levels  consecration of public freedoms  and participation of all segments of Tunisian society in the political life of the country  all in the framework of the rule of law and the institutions of the State. Furthermore  Tunisia’s economic and social achievements allowed it to attain a high rank among the group of countries with the highest human development index. That was appreciated by international financial institutions and specialized United Nations agencies. Tunisia pursues this process of reform and achievement with determination and perseverance.  Within its Maghreb  Arab and Mediterranean environment  Tunisia endeavours to strengthen relations of cooperation  solidarity  dialogue and consultation among all parties in order to reinforce security and stability  achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region for an integral development and encourage economic complementarity. For Tunisia  the establishment of the Arab Maghreb remains a strategic choice and in terms of civilization  a gain for peoples of the region  laying the foundations for increased integration and complementarity among the Maghreb countries. Tunisia works alongside its sister States of   11 06-53609  the region to further revitalize the march of the union in the interest of its peoples.   Our country is also keen to enhance its strong relationship with the European Union and to develop it towards the establishment of a solidarity-based partnership  which we hope will advance in a context of mutual respect and dialogue  thus serving the interests of all parties.  Tunisia  as part of the African continent  relentlessly continues to support the efforts of the African Union to finalize the establishment of its institutions and reinvigorate them  as well as to enhance its role in achieving solidarity-based development  security and stability throughout the continent. In this regard Tunisia has actively participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations  especially in Africa  convinced  as always  of the necessity to join international efforts to strengthen the foundations of peace and security throughout the world.   Although we believe that the future of the continent remains in the hands of Africans and that development can be achieved primarily by relying on their own capabilities  Africa needs more support and assistance from the international community to enable it to face the challenges and achieve the aspirations of its peoples.  The strong relationship and interaction among peace  security  development and social stability in today’s world confirm the need for all nations to join multilateral efforts on the basis of the values of dialogue  consensus and solidarity. That will help in finding the appropriate solutions to the challenges posed. We believe that the United Nations remains the ideal forum to deal with these urgent issues based on the values and principles of its Charter.  "
"175",7011,"TUR",61,2006,"I wish to begin by warmly congratulating the President of the General Assembly. Although the empowerment of women has long been a United Nations priority  it has been nearly 40 years since a woman last held the Assembly presidency. Thus  we are encouraged by her election. I wish her every success.  I also want to express my appreciation to the President of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson. The World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1)  which addresses the challenges of our time  was the joint product of our work and his tireless efforts. His sound guidance enabled us to move forward on the pressing issues related to reform. The Peacebuilding Commission  the Human Rights Council and the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy are the hallmarks of those efforts.   In addition  it is my distinct pleasure to pay a heartfelt tribute to our Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. His name will continue to inspire us whenever we think of his dedication to global peace and stability and his tireless reform efforts.   The hostilities and the outright destruction in Lebanon tested the faith placed in the United Nations. In the end  the resolve of Member States was manifested. From the very beginning  Turkey was engaged in active diplomacy and took its place at the forefront of the international efforts to end the bloodshed. At the same time  we remained in close contact with all the parties to the conflict. Throughout  we provided humanitarian aid to the people of Lebanon and assisted in the rapid evacuation of some 10 000 foreign nationals.  We supported the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). It is a major step forward. Yet  given the many challenges that remain  it is only a first step towards bringing peace and stability to the region. We have decided to contribute to the implementation of the resolution  which is aimed at restoring the political sovereignty of the Lebanese Government.  Indeed  we must try to seize the opportunity represented by resolution 1701 (2006). We hope that its spirit will be translated into a broader political perspective for the entire region. The tragic events in Lebanon should have reconfirmed that unilateralism is not the answer and that the use of force is not the solution. Similarly  they revealed for all to see that the question of Palestine continues to lie at the core of the problems in the Middle East.   This issue is not simply a conflict between two countries. It is a problem for which everyone pays a heavy price — a problem that has huge ripple effects on a global scale. Indeed  the continuation of this problem is used to justify extremism around the world. Therefore  progress made towards a lasting peace in the Middle East would have a positive impact on many other problems.  We note that everyone has drawn lessons from what took place in Lebanon. Now  in the aftermath of that tragedy  there is a different climate  conducive to a renewed peace initiative. Now is the time to revive efforts to put the Middle East peace process back on track. We make a heartfelt appeal to all the parties and to the international community not to let this opportunity pass by. What we need now is strong and determined leadership that will resolutely follow the path towards peace.   Let us not forget that the growing sense of injustice associated with the Middle East problem deepens the rift in terms of cultural perceptions. We cannot permit events in the region to undermine the prospects of the cross-cultural harmony that we are working so hard to achieve. We believe that better understanding among cultures is indispensable for global harmony. That is precisely why the Prime Ministers of Turkey and Spain co-sponsored the Alliance of Civilizations initiative  launched by the Secretary-General. The objective is to emphasize the elements that unite various societies around our common humanity.  The High-level Group for the Alliance of Civilizations will soon submit a comprehensive report to the Secretary-General setting out concrete and practical measures to improve intercultural dialogue. That is obviously what the world needs now. Therefore  we hope that the initiative will receive strong and sincere support from Member States.  Indeed  regardless of where we come from — whether it be the East or the West — whatever faith we profess and whatever tradition we represent  we must all act responsibly. In today’s world  in which information travels at the speed of light  we must all refrain from acts and statements that can be misconstrued and can strengthen the hand of extremists. Likewise  our reactions must demonstrate    06-53323 8  such a sense of responsibility. Thus  we call upon everyone to act with common sense and to keep humanity’s best interests at heart.  As we focus on the Middle East  we must not lose sight of Iraq. It is equally urgent that we build a democratic and prosperous Iraq that is whole and free from ethnic and sectarian violence. I should like to recall that a staggering number of people have lost their lives as a result of violence. We must all help the Iraqis to achieve a national consensus and to resolve their differences through dialogue and democratic processes. First and foremost  the Iraqis themselves must work towards that end.  Throughout the past year  terrorism has continued to claim innocent lives. There is a growing realization that no degree of leniency can be extended to those who commit acts of terror. There is no room for double standards  and we can make no distinction between terrorists. At the same time  we must keep in mind that terrorism  an age-old method of coercion  has no deep links to any culture or religion. We should also be cautious not to associate any faith with terrorism.  By voting in favour of the proposed United Nations comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem in the April 2004 referendum  Turkish Cypriots responded positively to the expectations of the international community. Notwithstanding the intensive and sincere efforts of the Secretary-General  the Greek Cypriot side rejected that plan. Despite that rejection  the Turkish side remains committed to a just  peaceful and comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus question  based on the well-established parameters determined through the good offices mission of the Secretary-General. Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus continue to support strongly the Secretary-General’s mission. Indeed  the United Nations is the only sound platform that can help deliver lasting peace  cooperation and prosperity to all inhabitants of the island of Cyprus. The Turkish side still maintains the hope that the Greek Cypriot leaders will support the vision of a new partnership based on political equality with their Turkish Cypriot counterparts. The Turkish Cypriots have already given their support to the 8 July agreement and their consent to the United Nations suggestions for implementing that agreement in due course. There should be full-fledged negotiations on substantive issues between the two leaders of the island. Our proposal of 24 January 2006 for the simultaneous lifting of all restrictions related to the island remains on the table. In this day and age  living under unjustly imposed restrictions defies all reason. It is time for the Turkish Cypriots to integrate into the global economy. We appeal to the international community to heed the call of the Secretary-General to end the current isolation of the Turkish Cypriots  which has no legal or moral basis.  Turkey is close to the centre of most of the issues of concern to the international community  which naturally figure prominently on my country’s foreign policy agenda. Our objective is to establish conditions for a lasting peace and enhance cooperation for integration in the greater region. In this context  our relations with our neighbours continue to diversify. We believe that our good-neighbourly relations with Greece will enhance cooperation  stability and prosperity in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean.  In a similar vein  we have prepared several regional initiatives. We take part in peacekeeping and police missions around the world. These greater objectives help explain our active diplomacy  primarily in regions such as the Balkans  the Middle East and the Caucasus surrounding Turkey. In all such instances  we work to avert outright conflict and consolidate stability. We try to put out the fires of discord and cultivate reconciliation. We are committed to political processes and diplomatic solutions and are in the forefront of post-conflict rehabilitation  reconstruction and assistance.  The Balkans are passing through a profound transformation. In order not to relive the pain and suffering of the 1990s  we must vigilantly keep watch over peace. We must promote the building of viable State structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We must also promote a peaceful transition in Kosovo. We welcome Montenegro as a new Member of the United Nations.   Frozen conflicts in the Caucasus also demand our urgent attention. Resolution of the Nagorny Karabakh conflict on the basis of Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity is of vital importance for peace and prosperity in the region. We would like to see this region become an area of prosperity based on cooperation.  We will continue to support the political process and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. In addition to our strong presence in the International Security Assistance Force  Turkey is establishing a provincial   9 06-53323  reconstruction team in the Vardak province of Afghanistan. Turkey will continue to be active in the areas of health  education and development in Afghanistan.   On the Kashmir question  we continue to encourage the parties involved to work for a just and lasting solution to the problem through dialogue.  We advocate reform at a time when transparency  the rule of law  gender equality  good governance and similar common values can no longer be denied to peoples  especially in an age of globalized communications.   Turkey’s efforts are not  of course  confined to its immediate vicinity. Having consolidated our place among the largest economies of the world  we want to enrich and improve our relations with more distant regions. Our aim is to strengthen bilateral ties with Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean  East Asia and the Pacific. We are actively engaged in efforts to resolve the problems of the African continent  having established local offices of the Turkish International Cooperation Agency in Addis Ababa and Khartoum to help coordinate this larger effort across the African continent. More branches will follow. Turkey has been recognized by the World Food Programme as a major donor of food to Africa. Turkey is also contributing to five United Nations and two European Union missions in Africa.  The fate of Africa is our common destiny  and we cannot remain indifferent to that continent’s acute problems. We must not let down Africa. We appeal to the more fortunate to help that continent achieve its true potential.   After reviewing our activities within the United Nations  we have selected a number of areas as a priority in our work. These are issues related to development  peacekeeping operations  the strengthening of peacebuilding activities  humanitarian and relief operations  combating terrorism in all its forms and enhancing global energy security through the creation of safe transportation routes.   Turkey firmly believes in the need for international cooperation to achieve environmentally friendly and socially sustainable development. We must better cater to the needs of the developing countries  particularly in the field of poverty reduction  eliminating infectious diseases  reducing infant mortality and improving maternal health. If we fail to create equal opportunities for women and provide education for children  none of the above will ever be achieved.  I am pleased to say that Turkey is becoming a major donor country. Last year  Turkish official development assistance reached US$ 600 million. This figure does not reflect the contribution of the Turkish private sector  which contributes an almost equivalent amount. In this regard  we will further increase our contributions to the United Nations funds and programmes that serve the least developed countries  landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.  The President returned to the Chair.   Over the past two years  we have been campaigning for a seat on the Security Council for the term 2009-2010. Turkey has not served on the Council since 1961. This is an anomaly. We believe that  in the spirit of equitable rotation  our turn to be represented is long overdue. Turkey’s membership will enrich the work of the Security Council in a singularly important manner. We will bring our unique attributes to bear on the work of the Council. Our membership will bring new insights and perspectives at a time when we see the United Nations becoming increasingly relevant in fulfilling the rightful hopes of humanity. "
"176",7027,"TUV",61,2006,"Everything has been said; everything has been noted. But while it may be true that many boats will rise with the tide  others are bound to sink unless goodwill prevails in this house. Tuvalu wishes to add its voice of solidarity to the work of the United Nations and to what has been a highly enlightening debate.  First  we join wholeheartedly in the high commendations already expressed with regard to the election of Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa as President of the General Assembly and her Bureau  and the sterling efforts of the outgoing President. Ms. Al-Khalifa and her Bureau have our full cooperation. We also wish to join others before us in paying tribute to the work of the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan. His initiatives on development  security and human rights have taken the United Nations ever closer to all peoples and have made the Organization accessible even to small island States such as Tuvalu. In appreciation  we wish him well and all the best in the future.  For my small island nation  joining the United Nations at the dawn of the new century is an expression of hope. Our hope is that  through the noble ideals and principles of this great body  Tuvalu  despite its physical remoteness and insignificance  will be allowed to paddle its canoe in harmony along with super-tankers and to share the common future of a world of larger freedom: a world in which every State  regardless of its size  is recognized in terms of its sovereignty  its independence and the human rights of its people.  We continue to hold fast to that hope. But  in the present world of interdependence  where great opportunities are accompanied by great challenges  the need for collective action and multilateral cooperation has never been so pressing and urgent. Victory over those challenges can be won not through political fragmentation  finger-pointing and confrontation  but through cooperation.  The showdown of words engaged in by some countries in this Chamber is unfortunate. We must    06-53958 10  never forget that along with wealth and power comes responsibility towards others. The risk is high that this House of humanity will fall apart for lack of responsibility and leadership. There is a call for everyone to consistently display the highest degree of morality  solidarity and respect for one other’s values and concerns. Otherwise  the ideals of the United Nations cannot be served. As a small  peace-loving nation  Tuvalu strongly believes that engaging in open dialogue and working together in a spirit of mutual understanding within United Nations frameworks is the only way to reach our shared destiny in diversity and with respect for one another.  Tuvalu takes pride in having been part of the United Nations during the negotiations on its reform and development agenda. The adoption and establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission and of major innovations in the Secretariat show the benefit of working together. Those bodies must be supported to ensure peace and the protection of the human rights of all peoples and communities. But our work will remain unfinished until we make the Security Council and its operational methodologies truly representative of the United Nations membership. To that end  we support the draft resolution of the Group of Four countries on expansion of the Security Council.  The President returned to the Chair.  Development  security and human rights are the cardinal purposes of the United Nations. The fulfilment of those purposes demands that we shoulder our collective responsibility and engage in united action. The successful conclusion of the World Summit last year was a reaffirmation of our resolve to fight poverty and ensure sustainable development through the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.  But devising plans without having access to adequate resources is akin to presenting a menu to hungry people: it may be mouth-watering  but without the necessary ingredients  the dishes it describes will remain unattainable. It is essential that we fully implement the Mauritius Strategy by integrating it into the work programmes of the Commission on Sustainable Development  United Nations agencies  conventions — especially the Rio Conventions — and bilateral cooperation partners. Additionally  the strengthening of the coordination capacity of the Department of Social and Economic Affairs with adequate resources in those areas is imperative.  Two weeks ago  in this very Hall  the General Assembly undertook the midterm review of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries. We  as both a least developed country and a small island developing State  are grateful to the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States for his dedicated work  and to the development partners for the support Tuvalu has enjoyed over the years.  It is certainly our view  however  that it is unrealistic and premature to list for graduation Tuvalu and our Pacific least developed country colleagues that are also small island developing States. We feel strongly that  before any graduation can be recommended  thorough consideration should be given to our unique economic vulnerabilities and that this should be done on an in-country basis  not merely through data analysis carried out at a desk halfway around the globe. For these very reasons  and with a view to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  there is a critical need to ensure a United Nations presence in all Pacific small island developing States.  Last month a new Government was elected to power in Tuvalu and has pledged good governance and media freedom as its guiding principles. It has adopted the Tuvalu Sustainable Development Strategy  known as “Te Kakeega II: Vision 2015”  as its framework for development partnerships and looks forward to working with the rest of the world in its implementation.  Security challenges continue to create havoc  fear and uncertainty worldwide. Tuvalu strongly deplores terrorism in all its forms and expressions. We in the Pacific are not immune from acts of terrorism. We must therefore collectively continue to make the strongest efforts in our campaign against these forces and be resolute in ensuring effective global anti-terrorism action.  We also encourage the continuing role of the United Nations in working towards a solution to the Palestinian question and in ensuring peace for the   11 06-53958  people of Afghanistan  Darfur  Timor-Leste and other regions.  Clearly the United Nations has done well in preventing and resolving deadly conflicts throughout the world. But despite those achievements  the non-representation of Taiwan in the United Nations and its agencies remains an issue of great concern. The threats posed by China’s deployment of missiles aimed at Taiwan and the use of force in the Taiwan Strait are real  for the East Asian and Pacific region and for the world as a whole. We urge that immediate peaceful and preventive actions be taken in the Taiwan Strait for the sake of all.  No other challenge to global security is more serious and threatening than the impact of climate change. Climate change is a global problem and can be resolved only through global collective action. Addressing climate change must therefore must be placed at the centre of the work of the United Nations. As is well known  small island developing States like Tuvalu are extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change and sea-level rise  and already evidence of devastation is prevalent in all regions of the small island developing States. Over the past few years  Tuvalu has witnessed unusual flooding of the main islands with seawater and king tides  as well as severe attacks on fresh water  vegetation  foreshores and coral reefs.  We are frightened and very worried by all these things  which are the result of the actions of others. If nothing is done urgently and we are forced out of our islands  there is no other Tuvalu to which to move. There is still time to act. Once again we appeal to this body for help and for real action.  We strongly believe that we have reached a dangerous level of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and that urgent action is required to accelerate the necessary responses. The options are available; what is clearly lacking is political will. Unless climate change is addressed  all our efforts for development  security and protection of human rights will be severely undermined.  Clearly it is urgent that the international community take more aggressive action to reduce greenhouse gases. All countries  industrialized and developing  must do their part  with the industrialized countries taking the lead  including through the full implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.  To help developing countries contribute in a committed way  we need stronger incentives to promote the development and distribution of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. We need a global fund to support such efforts.  It is disappointing to see some large industrialized countries’ continued denial and the absence of enough political will on their part to support vulnerable countries such as small island developing States to adapt to the impacts of climate change. We must recognize the “polluter pays” principle and ensure that the countries that are producing the greenhouse gas emissions pay for the damage they are causing to the vulnerable countries.  There is also a need to generate considerably more funds to underwrite the costs of adaptation  including international levies to generate income to boost funding for adaptation and insurance in small island developing States. The mainstreaming of the Mauritius Strategy into the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  as required under resolution 59/311  is crucial in that regard.  Defining the way forward with respect to future commitments and actions in the area of climate change will require strong political will on the part of all countries. The upcoming twelfth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention and the second meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  to be held in Nairobi  must come up with clear and practical timetables for accelerated action on mitigation and adaptation. It is imperative also to improve access by small island developing States and least developed countries to Global Environment Facility climate-change resources and convention-related funds. The Nairobi meetings must also decide on governance and management arrangements for the Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund to facilitate its early operation.  Finally  we strongly believe that the General Assembly should host  as soon as possible  a summit at the level of heads of Government aimed at bringing forward workable proposals with strong  high-level political endorsement so as to address climate change beyond the year 2012.  Our call for urgent action on climate change is not self-serving. Tuvalu and the small island developing States may be the first to suffer from the    06-53958 12  impacts of climate change  but the consequences of not taking real action now will be felt by all around the globe. We all must work together on climate change in a spirit of strong solidarity.  The people of Tuvalu have full confidence in the United Nations and in its ability to ensure the achievement by all peoples of its cardinal purposes of development  security and human rights. It cannot fail the world on climate change; it cannot dash our hopes. Please do not let Tuvalu sink.  God bless the United Nations family. God bless Tuvalu.  "
"177",7073,"TZA",61,2006,"Permit me to begin by congratulating Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her well deserved election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. This is an important milestone on the gender agenda of the United Nations. I wish her great success and assure her of Tanzania’s full support and cooperation as she discharges her duties.   I would also like to commend her predecessor  His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his able stewardship of the Assembly’s sixtieth session. Under his leadership  Tanzania was privileged to co-chair  with Denmark  negotiations that led to the operationalization of the Peacebuilding Commission.   15 06-52885   I stand before this Assembly as the fourth President of my country  Tanzania  following another successful democratic election last year. This is the third smooth transition of power in Tanzania. I took over from my eminent predecessor in office  His Excellency Benjamin William Mkapa  who has remained active both at home and abroad. He remains my useful and wise counsel  as does his predecessor His Excellency Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Among the many functions that former President Mkapa continues to discharge for our country and the human family as a whole is his membership in the Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on System-Wide Coherence  which is an important task on our agenda for the reform of the United Nations.  Such was the success of the previous administration that I can only come before you with one central message — a message of policy continuity  nationally  regionally and internationally.  We will continue the efforts of the previous administration to promote peace  stability and national unity. In addition  we shall redouble our efforts to uphold and strengthen good democratic governance  respect for human rights and the rule of law  and intensify the fight against corruption. We feel greatly honoured in this regard that the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption decided to hold its second global conference in Arusha in two days’ time  in recognition and support of our efforts.  Tanzania also made impressive economic strides  making it one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. I intend to sustain and enhance that record with greater zeal  vigour and speed.  Similarly  Tanzania has emerged as one of the best-practice cases in terms of ownership of the development agenda and the harmonization and coordination of development assistance. I will advance this policy and practice during my tenure in the hope that it will contribute to the realization of the theme of this General Assembly: the implementation of a global partnership for development.  In view of this record  and given our political and macro-economic stability and political will  Tanzania is now well poised to accelerate the pace towards the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. For this to happen  however  we need international support to upgrade our infrastructure and build capacity for value-addition processes and human resource development. Fortunately  the framework for such international support already exists  for example through the Monterrey Consensus. I believe Tanzania has lived up to its commitment under the Global Compact for development. I now call upon our development partners to do likewise.  Cognizant of the role of the private sector as the engine of growth in Tanzania  we have implemented far-reaching policies and institutional reforms geared to creating an environment conducive to the thriving of private business.  The World Bank’s “Doing Business 2007” report recognizes Tanzania as one of the top-ten best reforming countries in the world. That means that Tanzania has again fulfilled its commitments under the Global Compact. We therefore call upon our development partners to buttress our efforts and assist the private sector in responding positively.  The success of whatever we try to do nationally depends critically on a peaceful neighbourhood. For too long  Tanzania has suffered from the consequences of conflict and instability in the Great Lakes region  including hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees and the destruction of infrastructure and the environment  and in terms of time and resources deployed in facilitating conflict resolution. For this reason  Tanzania will continue to play its part in the quest for peace  security  stability and development in the Great Lakes region.  Significant progress has been achieved in the political and security situation in the Great Lakes region. We appreciate the support of the United Nations and other partners in the regional peace processes. Tanzania welcomes and commends the Government of Burundi and the Parti pour la libération du peuple hutu-Forces nationales de libération rebel group for finally signing the ceasefire agreement. We are humbled that we could be given an opportunity to make our contribution. We promise to continue to be useful in whatever way may be required.   Likewise  I commend the Government  the major political actors and the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo for holding the long-awaited elections. We urge that the forthcoming second round of elections be conducted in a free  fair and peaceful manner. Tanzania  as Chair of the Southern African Development Community Organ on Politics  Defence and Security  will play its role in support of this    06-52885 16  process. As a friendly neighbour  we will endeavour to be as useful as is necessary.   Moreover  Tanzania  as current chair of the Initiative for Peace and Security in the Great Lakes Region  will continue to work closely with other members to ensure a successful Second International Conference on the Great Lakes Region later this year in Nairobi.  I wish to put on record our sincere gratitude to the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes Region for their support. I appeal to them and the international community to remain engaged with this process.  Peace seems to have eluded the world. Reports of wars and violent conflicts are headline news in most of our media. Unfortunately Africa  the poorest of the continents  has had an unfair share of conflict. Like other delegates  we express our concern for the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur  and call for continued engagement at the regional level and by the international community. Likewise  we are deeply concerned about the situation in Somalia  Côte d’Ivoire and elsewhere on the continent.  The continuing impasse on the issue of the Western Sahara is unfortunate. After 31 years  it is high time that the United Nations redouble its efforts to resolve this matter. The United Nations resolved the question of East Timor  which has a lot of similarities to that of the Saharans. The people of Western Sahara deserve no less from their United Nations. I believe it could be done if all parties played their part appropriately.  Turning to the situation in the Middle East  I am pleased to see the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon holding  and troop contributing countries responding positively in reinforcing the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  The 34-day war in Lebanon took international attention away from the plight of the Palestinian people. The lack of progress towards a negotiated two-State solution and the decline in confidence in the peace process are worrying developments. We call upon the Quartet  and encourage bilateral and other multilateral initiatives  to revive the peace process laid down in the road map. A just  viable  lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East can come only through negotiations  and no other way.  Tanzania welcomes and applauds the adoption by the General Assembly of a comprehensive Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288). It is our expectation that the differences that arose during the negotiations will not stand in the way of the Strategy’s implementation. After experiencing a major terrorist attack on our soil in 1998  Tanzania has always repeated its resolve to cooperate with others to combat terrorism in all its manifestations. The threat of terrorism is global and complex; it demands our collective efforts and an adaptive strategy to contain it. Thank God we already have that strategy — let us implement it.   Tanzania has always stood for the sovereign equality of nations and for the primacy of multilateralism in global governance and in addressing global issues. We have always cherished and stood for the central role of the United Nations in global affairs. We promise to continue to be faithful and responsible members of the United Nations. It is now our intention to participate more actively in United Nations peacekeeping missions and operations.  We have always believed that the United Nations of today has to reflect  in its structure  policies  programmes and activities  the realities of the world of today  not that of sixty years ago. The United Nations has to move with the changing times and aspirations of its membership. I want to reaffirm Tanzania’s continued commitment to these urgent and legitimate demands. We are very much committed to the reform agenda of the United Nations  especially reform of the Security Council to make it more representative and more responsive to changing realities.  Tanzania’s term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council will end in three months. I would like to thank all members for having accorded my country the honour of serving in that very important United Nations organ. We thank our fellow Council members for their cooperation and support during our term of office. As we prepare to leave the Council  we are gratified that we were able to organize a special Council meeting to discuss the situation in the Great Lakes region at which useful conclusions and decisions were made.  As we prepare to leave the Council  we are also gratified that we have taken note of the feeling in the Council of the need to reform that body. Let us pluck up courage and take the bull by the horns.    17 06-52885   Allow me to pay special tribute to our outgoing  illustrious Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan — a great internationalist and a great statesman. We congratulate him for a job well done and for his able leadership during a particularly difficult period for the world  for the United Nations and for him  personally. He will be remembered as one who challenged the Organization to live up to the true promise of multilateralism  through delivering collective security  pursuing fundamental human rights and the rule of law and promoting human development. We thank him and wish him the best of luck on his retirement. I hope that he will be given time to retire. "
"178",7116,"UGA",61,2006,"Let me first of all congratulate Ms. Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa on her election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session. I am confident that  with her wealth of experience  she will guide our deliberations effectively. I wish also to thank her predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson of Sweden  for the manner in which he presided over the high-level segment of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.  Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his leadership of our Organization. His 10-year tenure has been marked by fundamental changes. The United Nations has witnessed major reforms geared at creating a more efficient and effective institution. We are confident that he will leave behind a more vibrant Organization capable of meeting the challenges of our time.  As a firm supporter of multilateralism  Uganda believes that the Assembly is the most appropriate forum for addressing issues of global concern. A great number of important decisions have been taken by the Assembly. Landmark agreements have been reached and important commitments undertaken by members of the Assembly.  In spite of all these efforts  threats to global peace and security and to human dignity are more serious   49 06-52885  than ever before. This situation obtains today because we have yet to start addressing the real root causes of the problems facing us. My delegation believes that ensuring global peace will continue to be an uphill task for us as long as the majority in developing countries and elsewhere in the world continue to suffer the indignity of poverty and deprivation while we continue to think that it is business as usual.   We must ask ourselves why a large number of international problems that are high on the agenda of the United Nations are occurring in the developing part of the world. These are real issues that affect the daily lives of peoples  and they require urgent solutions which have been to date been far too slow in coming.  The onus is on the Assembly to ensure that what we agree upon or commit ourselves to doing is done in a timely manner. The Millennium Declaration that we adopted here 6 years ago (resolution 55/2) remains an important milestone because it introduced a new paradigm shift from emphasis on statement of commitments to action. However  there have been some obstacles to the achievement of the goals we set for ourselves.   In areas where progress has been made  due credit must be given. In that regard  Uganda welcomes the establishment of the Human Rights Council to work alongside the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. We are also pleased that action was promptly taken to create the Peacebuilding Commission as an important intergovernmental mechanism to assist countries in transition from war to durable peace. We welcome those as important contributions to the reform agenda of the United Nations.  While commendable progress has been achieved in other areas of reform  great frustration remains over the reform and expansion of the Security Council. In my delegation’s view  the expansion of the Security Council is the most important facet of United Nations reform with regard to the maintenance of global peace and security.  It is now a truism that the Security Council does not reflect today’s geopolitical realities  but only the balance of power that prevailed in the 1940s. Africa is the only continent with no permanent member on the Security Council  despite its size and population. That is why Africa is demanding at least two permanent seats on the Council. We acknowledge that the existence of the veto is an anachronism  but as long as it exists we should demand it  because do not want to join as second-class members  with no veto.  Lack of agreement on how to move the development agenda forward is one of our major concerns. It is unacceptable for big sections of the global community to continue living on less than one dollar per day while we have the capacity and the means to pull them out of that abject poverty. We must address that problem as a matter of urgency. One way of doing so is to live by our own commitments  as reflected  for example  in the Monterrey Consensus  the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the Brussels Plan of Action  et cetera  et cetera. We must put in place measurable benchmarks to realize those goals.   It is disappointing to see that very little progress has been made to date on official development assistance  on foreign direct investments  on debts  or even on market access. The stalled conclusion of the World Trade Organization development agenda is a case in point. The Doha Development Round was launched as a process that would eventually give developing countries a fair chance to compete in the world marketplace. It was expected to restore the momentum of the open market while giving genuine priority to the concerns and interests of developing countries. Five years down the road  we have not agreed on opening up markets or eliminating discriminative subsidies.  My delegation strongly feels that part of that failure is attributable to the multilateral system’s lack of good global governance  poor coordination and lack of coherence. As the United Nations has a responsibility to identify the causes hindering the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  the Organization is the right body to track implementation of commitments undertaken by development partners. An effective mechanism should be devised for doing that.  Uganda calls on the international community  and the United Nations in particular  to explore new and more effective ways of promoting consensus on issues of vital importance to the peace  security and prosperity of our global community. In that regard  we would like to welcome and encourage the holding of    06-52885 50  the high-level events that have been organized alongside this session.   The High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development held last week has produced important outcomes that are going to be valuable in the formulation of policies on international migration and development. In the same light  the convening of the High-level Meeting on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries is a welcome decision as it will feed into the midterm review.  With regard to Africa’s development  the New Partnership for Africa’s Development — NEPAD — is the key framework for action. We continue to urge development partners to support Africa’s efforts by contributing positively and effectively to the implementation of that regional development strategy. Of the United Nations system in particular we request that the funding that comes from United Nations development systems should focus on Africa’s priorities as determined by the partner States  while care should be taken to avoid diversion of development resources to other donor-driven activities.  I would like now to briefly turn my attention to the situation in our region. Uganda’s security and development is directly interlinked with developments in the Great Lakes region. We are therefore fully committed to the realization of peace and security  and have continued to play a key role in the search for durable peace and security in our region.   We welcome the positive developments in the southern Sudan following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We fully support the democratic process being pursued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We call upon all parties involved to have full confidence in the process so that it can be successfully completed. The regional initiative on Burundi under Uganda’s chairmanship has made steady progress  and we have full confidence in its success.   Uganda also wishes to appeal to the international community  especially our development partners  to support the peace initiatives in the region by contributing generously to the success of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region  initiated by the United Nations in collaboration with the African Union.  With regard to Somalia  we call for international support for the Transitional Federal Government. We call on the Security Council to support the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace process and the partial lifting of the arms embargo to enable deployment of the IGAD Peace Support Mission to Somalia and the African Union forces.  At the national level  in Uganda there is an organization called the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA)  a terrorist group with no political agenda  which has for a number of years unleashed terror on the population of northern Uganda  killing and maiming people and abducting children for training as killers and use as sex slaves. The LRA has now been defeated and its remnants have fled to Garamba Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Government of Uganda has now entered into peace talks with the LRA under the mediation of the Government of southern Sudan with a view to restoring peace and stability.  After a careful analysis of the situation  the Government of Uganda decided to take the painful decision to offer amnesty to the LRA top leadership  in order to facilitate the peace talks. That decision was painful in the sense that we do not condone or tolerate impunity whatsoever. However  we are convinced that the alternative traditional justice system that we intend to apply is an equitable solution and should be given a chance. We call on the international community to support the process that we have embarked on. We are determined to resolve the conflict peacefully. Peace is what our people want  and it is peace that we are determined to give them. "
"179",7163,"UKR",61,2006,"First of all  I would like to congratulate our President on her election to this high post and to assure her of the full support of Ukraine throughout her mandate. I would also like to express our deep appreciation of her predecessor and my good friend  Mr. Jan Eliasson  for his outstanding contribution to progress in implementing the decisions of the 2005 World Summit.  I would also like to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  who is about to relinquish his important and noble mission. I praise Mr. Annan for his valuable personal contributions and devoted efforts to further all aspects of United Nations activities and wish him the best in his further endeavours.  We are convinced that the next Secretary-General must be a person truly deserving of the post and who will discharge this responsible duty with honour. I would like to again emphasize the justified position of the Eastern European States regarding the priority right for a representative of this region to be appointed to the top post at the United Nations. Eastern Europe remains the only region that has never had a representative serve as Secretary-General. In this respect  we welcome the nomination of Ms. Vaira Vike-Freiberga  President of the Republic of Latvia.  Our achievements in implementing last year’s Summit decisions are quite impressive. The Human Rights Council  of which Ukraine is an active member  has started its work. The Peacebuilding Commission  the Central Emergency Response Fund and the United Nations Democracy Fund are all functioning and making important contributions towards overcoming disasters and injustice. All of these are notable milestones in the process of reforming the United Nations.  Still  we are far from ensuring the adaptation of our Organization to today’s realities  let alone preparing it for addressing tomorrow’s threats and challenges. The reform of the Security Council  the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council  the promotion of the 2005 World Summit agenda for development and improvement in the management of the Secretariat have yet to be tackled.  It is well known that without the modernization of the Security Council  an indispensable pillar of the collective security system  reform of the United Nations would be incomplete. From standpoint of the Member States of the Eastern European Group  this thesis could be paraphrased as follows: no enlargement of the Security Council would be complete without ensuring the enhanced representation of Eastern Europe. The doubling of the Group’s membership since 1991  with  most recently  the Republic of Montenegro joining the United Nations as its one hundred ninety-second Member  supports our argument. At this point  I would like to welcome the friendly Republic of Montenegro to the United Nations family.  We need to unite our efforts so that the United Nations — that is  all of us together — can adequately respond to the broad spectrum of existing and future challenges in the areas of security  development and human rights.  Recent commemoration of the fifth anniversary of the barbaric terrorist attack on this city  as well as the growing number of terrorist acts in many parts of the world  should leave no doubt that terrorism continues to remain one of the most dangerous threats of the present day.  Ukraine welcomes the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and is ready to make important contributions towards its effective realization. This important decision has become another strong signal that terrorism will not be tolerated. The Strategy also testifies to the readiness of the international community to strengthen coordination and increase the effectiveness of measures to combat this hideous phenomenon  within the framework of a concrete    06-53329 20  action plan. On its part  Ukraine recently ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. We call upon Member States to make additional efforts during the current session of the General Assembly to elaborate on and adopt the comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  Ukraine is deeply concerned with the situation in the Middle East. Recent events in Lebanon and the continuing Israeli-Palestinian crisis have shown the need for more decisive international efforts aimed at returning peace and stability to this region. Violence and hatred cannot become the alternatives to the restoration of dialogue and negotiations aimed at achieving a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict on all of its tracks.  Ukraine therefore welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) on Lebanon. Support of the resolution by all parties in the region allows for hope that it will be fully implemented. As a longstanding contributor to the United Nations Peacekeeping efforts  including in the Middle East  Ukraine made its concrete proposals on contributing to the enhanced United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  The inability to agree on a set of commitments regarding disarmament and non-proliferation was one of the major setbacks of the 2005 World Summit. More than a decade ago Ukraine made a historic contribution in this area when it unilaterally renounced the world’s third largest nuclear weapons arsenal. Therefore  we call upon Member States to strive for progress in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation in the United Nations and other forums  for the sake of future generations.  Lately  the international community has been concerned with the nuclear programme of Iran. Ukraine supports the efforts of those countries that seek to gain Teheran’s return to full and close cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Appropriate levels of transparency and cooperation with Iran on this issue would help to ease the concerns of the international community. Ukraine stands for the right of all nations to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes; however  in realizing this right  nations must fully adhere to commitments in the field of non-proliferation.  One of the most important tests of the ability of the United Nations to deal effectively with inter-ethnic conflict will be how the future status of Kosovo is handled.  Taking into account the fragile situation in and around Kosovo  the political process of determining its future status should be handled with maximum responsibility by all the parties involved. Any imposed decision leading to a unilateral change of borders of that internationally recognized democratic State will inevitably destabilize the situation in the Balkan region and set dangerous precedents in Europe and the entire world. Unfortunately  we are already witnessing the unfolding of an undesirable scenario created by attempts to use the Kosovo settlement as a precedent for claiming independence for several self-proclaimed regimes within the boundaries of the former Soviet Union. I refer to so-called referendums on independence recently held in Transdniestria  Moldova  and scheduled for the near future in South Ossetia  Georgia. Ukraine and the international community do not recognize these referendums  considering them illegitimate and without legal consequences.  Ukraine supports the need for negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina aimed at finding a mutually acceptable solution based on Security Council decisions  including resolution 1244 (1999). It is extremely important to ensure that the decision of the Security Council on the final status of Kosovo does not impose a solution  which can be taken only with the clearly expressed consent of both parties concerned.   As representative of Ukraine and Chair of the GUAM — Georgia  Ukraine  Azerbaijan  Moldova Group — Organization for Democracy and Economic Development  I would like to thank the countries that supported placing on the agenda of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly item 27 on protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace  security and development. It is an important step that will help to draw attention to the need for more active and effective steps by the international community to achieve progress in settling conflicts on the territory of Azerbaijan  Georgia and Moldova. We call for implementing the initiative proposed by the President of Ukraine on Transdniestria entitled “To settlement through democracy”  the plan for a peace settlement in South Ossetia presented by the President of Georgia  and for implementing the Security Council resolutions and OSCE decisions on the conflicts in Nagorny Karabakh and Abkhazia. These conflicts are among the main obstacles to the   21 06-53329  full-scale democratic transformation of the region  which is among the core elements of Ukraine’s regional policy.  Having gained a new level of integration during the Kyiv Summit last May  GUAM member States set as their main goals the strengthening of democratic values  the rule of law  and human rights and fundamental freedoms  the deepening of European integration  and the achievement of sustainable development and the greater well-being of their peoples.  The Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization (BSEC) is another promising model of multilateral political and economic cooperation. During the 14 years of its dynamic existence  that organization has proved its value as a framework for regional cooperation. Because issues of energy security are very important for Europe today  the Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions take on special significance for the secure  stable extraction and transportation of energy resources. Ukraine is ready to take an active part in promoting energy projects within the BSEC framework. We are convinced that the BSEC can effectively support the efforts of the world community to combat terrorism  resolve the so-called frozen conflicts in the region and combat trans-border crime. It is necessary to coordinate BSEC activity with corresponding programmes supported by the United Nations  the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  the European Union and NATO.  The Forum of the Community of Democratic Choice (CDC)  held in Kyiv in December 2005  is another example of cooperation aimed at strengthening European democratic values in Eastern Europe. The CDC is a forum in which the States of the Baltic Sea-Black Sea-Caspian Sea area with the Balkans discuss their aspirations for the higher democratic standards required for full-scale European integration. GUAM  BSEC and the CDC are valuable contributions to the creation of an Eastern Europe area akin to the European Union area of democracy  stability and prosperity.  Democracy  the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are essential elements of Ukraine’s domestic and foreign policies. That is why we are proud to have been elected to the Human Rights Council. As a member of that body  Ukraine is ready to work with other States to bring about real change through the promotion of human rights worldwide.  The international community is responsible for protecting people threatened with genocide or other violations of fundamental human rights. In two years  we will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. One and a half decades before the adoption of the Convention  and even before the tragedy of the Holocaust  the Ukrainian people was a victim of genocide. Deliberately organized by the Communist totalitarian regime for the purpose of destroying the vital core of the freedom-loving Ukrainian people — its peasantry — the Holodomor in Ukraine of 1932 and 1933 killed 7 million to 10 million innocent men  women and children  about 25 per cent of Ukraine’s population at that time. The Communist regime tried to conceal the scale and tragic consequences of that inhuman crime from the world community  and they succeeded for a long time.   After Ukraine regained its independence  many new appalling and horrifying facts were revealed. The parliaments of a number of countries have recognized the Holodomor of 1932 and 1933 as an act of genocide. Ukraine calls on the United Nations  as the collective voice of the international community  to contribute to the commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Convention by recognizing the Holodomor as an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. That step would contribute towards making genocide and mass abuse of human rights impossible in the future.  With the same aim  a number of events will take place in Kyiv tomorrow to commemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Babyn Yar tragedy. The mass executions by the Nazis there were among the first sad pages of the evolving tragedy of the Holocaust. Etched in the memory of the Ukrainian people  it also saw the death of tens of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war of various nationalities. This event will be yet another important reminder of the lessons of history and the need to prevent all manifestations of anti-Semitism  xenophobia and intolerance.  Needless to say  we should focus on implementing the Millennium Development Goals and new commitments on the global development agenda made at the 2005 World Summit. There has been mixed progress in this area  and the commitments and promises made have not yet been translated into action    06-53329 22  with direct impact on the lives of peoples in need. The response to global threats should be effective and timely. It took the international community nearly 20 years since the first recorded cases of AIDS to recognize that this disease could threaten the very existence of humanity. The twenty-sixth special session of the Assembly initiated by Ukraine together with other States  and held in 2001  was a turning point in combating HIV/AIDS. I want to confirm Ukraine’s commitment to implementing the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution S-26/2) and to express hope for continuing close cooperation in this field with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  with the World Bank and with United Nations specialized agencies.  Lately  we have witnessed the emergence of a new disease that potentially poses no less a challenge to humanity than HIV/AIDS. Avian influenza threatens the entire world and knows no borders. It is our joint responsibility to ensure that all countries are protected against this threat. Combating the spread of avian influenza and preparations for a possible pandemic of human influenza demand concerted action at the national  regional and global levels. Should we repeat the mistakes of the past or should we learn the lessons and thus meet the challenge prepared? We believe that the General Assembly should consider the problem and provide the answer.  In the more than 60 years since its creation  the United Nations has grown both in numbers — from 51 States to 192 — and in quality. Our Organization has gained invaluable experience in changing the world so that every person can enjoy more security  justice and dignity. However  much remains yet to be achieved. I believe that it is within our power and in our interest to do all we can to ensure that the world is united not only by a common past but by a common future as well. "
"180",7210,"URY",61,2006,"Madam President  I bring to you the greeting of the people and Government of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to this Assembly. This Assembly is the broadest and most representative and important forum in the world today.  Madam President  may I express my personal satisfaction at seeing you exercise such an important function and I am sure that as a woman you will be able to add to the office an additional share of moderation and restraint.  In Uruguay  like the United Nations  we feel that it is very important to preach by example. That is why the Government I represent has also assumed  among its many tasks  that of elevating the status of women and increasing their participation in various areas.   Likewise  I am very happy to bring to you a special message from the President of Uruguay  Mr. Tabaré Vásquez  for the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  to thank him for his unrelenting efforts to drive the immense process of reforming the Organization. My country and the other Members of this house are fully committed to this reform.  On the occasion of the sixteenth Ibero-American Summit that will take place in Uruguay  the countries of the conference will express to the Secretary-General their thanks for his outstanding work. I would also like to say that the main subject of the Summit will be migration and development. Recently  we had a very constructive high-level dialogue on this subject in this house.  A year ago  during the sixtieth session of this forum  the President of our country said that the commitment of Uruguay to the United Nations Organization is both demanding and hopeful.  Our commitment is demanding because of the challenges that the current world faces and because of the opportunities implicit in the present  upon the management of which our future depends.   Our commitment is hopeful. Although we realize that there are difficulties and limitations on the international scene and at the regional and national levels  we believe in human beings  we believe in society  we believe in democracy as a common house and in freedom as the mother tongue of humanity.  The Eastern Republic of Uruguay reaffirms the principles that characterize our foreign policy  namely  our commitment to peace  sovereignty  democracy and solidarity; a firm rejection of all types of terrorism  violence and discrimination; the inalienable right of countries to have stable and secure borders and to fully exercise their sovereignty and self-determination; the respect for international law as a guarantee of sovereignty of peoples and their peaceful cohabitation; non-intervention in the internal affairs of States; multilateralism as a way of strengthening international law and as a way to organize the role of the United Nations; and the recognition of the indivisibility of all human rights  be they political  social  economic  civil or cultural  including collective rights  such as the right to development and the environment. Consequently  our country feels that progress in reforming the Organization must be achieved and we are making our contribution to that process  which will enable the   35 06-53341  United Nations to fulfil its tasks with greater effectiveness.  Greater effectiveness should also be sought by the important recently created bodies  the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. Uruguay is already actively participating in the Human Rights Council and we hope to join the organizing committee of the Peacebuilding Commission.   As a country that is a major contributor of troops and in support of the goal of peacekeeping  we have participated in peacekeeping missions since the creation of this Organization. The most recent example of this our active undertaking and participation in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)  which is an essential mechanism for securing a lasting peace and for restoring the social fabric of a dear Latin American nation.  Likewise  Uruguay would like to renew its active commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as agreed to by the Heads of State and Government. When I say “active”  I say this as a reflection of how much progress has been made towards the goals set forth in the agreement signed in September 2005.   I cannot refer now to each of these goals at this time  but one of the main goals is “the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger”. In Uruguay  by means of the interaction of various governmental programmes  we have implemented an emergency social plan that deals with the most basic needs of those in extreme poverty.   Poverty has begun to decrease  dropping from 32.6 per cent of the recorded population in 2004 to 29.8 per cent at the end of 2005. We feel that this is still not sufficient  but it is progress  not only in terms of social protection  but also in terms of social integration.  This is so because the great problems that have produced poverty in our country  as in other countries  are not just hunger  the lack of housing  illiteracy  academic failure or teenage pregnancies  but also discrimination  stigmatization  insecurity and despair  indeed  situations that indicate being integrated in society is much more than subsisting.  Social integration is essential  too  because the right to participate in social life also involves recognizing individuals as active citizens and not just as people who need to be helped.  And social integration is key  because the right that our citizens are asking for — all of them  even the poorest — is not just the right to live  but also the right to be recognized as individuals and the right to live together in society. This is called democracy and citizenship.  Allow me from this important podium and on behalf of the Government I represent to refer to three matters of particular importance for our country. One of them has to do with the facts of the recent past. There can be no future without memory  no freedom without justice. That is why  within the framework of legislation in force  Uruguay is taking concrete steps to heal the wounds caused by the violation of human rights during the dictatorship that ruled the country between 1973 and 1985. It has been difficult work and it is also very difficult to learn and accept the truth  but it does strengthen democracy as a form of Government and condition in society. Moreover  truth and justice help to ensure that the horrors of the past are never repeated.  I am very happy to inform this General Assembly that my country has taken one further step in the promotion and defence of human rights. The Uruguayan parliament has just unanimously approved a bill on genocide  crimes against humanity  war crimes and cooperation with the International Criminal Court.  Another subject that relates to the current situation and the future is climate change and the degradation of the environment. Uruguay is a party to the main international conventions in this area and  while stressing the indispensable international cooperation on this subject  we do particularly stress  once again  the individual responsibility of each State to actively protect the environment in its territory and waters and to make the vigilant participation of civil society a high priority.  It is not enough to simply protest pernicious transfers of polluting industrial processes. It is incumbent upon the State to act firmly to be vigilant and monitor and to impose high environmental standards on foreign and domestic companies.   Uruguay receives significant investment for industrial development on its territory  but we have very strict controls on the environmental aspects of    06-53341 36  those investments and we apply an internationally recognized standard that reflects our motto “Natural Uruguay”. We require the use of the most modern technologies available  and we monitor effectively  on the ground  the environmental effects of such ventures.  The Government of Uruguay reiterates its commitment to the protection of the environment in all parts of the world as a human right and as the cornerstone for achieving true sustainable development. In this sense  Uruguay calls upon the international community  and particularly the donor countries  to increase their cooperation in the area of the environment for developing countries and assume in a responsible manner global environmental goals that involve shared but differentiated responsibilities for everyone.  Finally  I would like to address our commitment to the strengthening of the multilateral trading system and the need to bring the Doha Development Round to a successful conclusion  in order to ensure that the development dimension is reflected in specific results and not just programmatic measures. For that  it is important to resume  as soon as possible  the negotiations in Geneva  always bearing in mind that we will not achieve satisfactory results without the elimination of agricultural subsidies  in the form of exports that receive internal support and the significant opening up of access to markets  particularly in the developed countries.  Everyone here in this Hall knows that there is no peace in intolerance and terrorism  and there is no freedom in poverty  nor democracy in inequality. We reaffirm our conviction that these threats can only be overcome if we join our efforts together and fully appreciate the wealth of our own cultural diversity  both among nations as well as within our respective nations.  Among nations  we must rely on the respect of our traditions and cultures and a broad-based dialogue among them in order to find useful synergies. And within each of our countries  we must rely on active policies promoting social cohesion that embrace our very cultural  ethnic and religious diversities. We have to move from words to acts  from declarations to action. This is not easy  but it is essential.  We are not starting from zero. The brief history of this Organization is testament to that.  But we still have a lot of work to do. It is a large task which  honestly  will never end and the results will never be perfect.  But these zones of continuity and imperfection establish the ideals that call on us to act and the commitments that drive us forward.   If this sixty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is able to help us in this task  it will have fulfilled its mission. "
"181",7257,"USA",61,2006,"I am grateful for the privilege of speaking to the General Assembly.  Last week  America and the world marked the fifth anniversary of the attacks that filled another September morning with death and suffering. On that terrible day  extremists killed nearly 3 000 innocent people  including citizens of dozens of nations represented right here in this Hall. Since then  the enemies of humanity have continued their campaign of murder. Al-Qaida and those inspired by its extremist ideology have attacked more than two dozen nations. And recently  a different group of extremists deliberately provoked a terrible conflict in Lebanon. At the start of the twenty-first century  it is clear that the world is engaged in a great ideological struggle between extremists who use terror as a weapon to create fear and moderate people who work for peace.  Five years ago  I stood at this rostrum and called on the community of nations to defend civilization and build a more hopeful future. This is still the great challenge of our time. It is the calling of our generation. This morning  I want to speak about the more hopeful world that is within our reach — a world beyond terror  where ordinary men and women are free to determine their own destiny  where the voices of moderation are empowered and where the extremists are marginalized by the peaceful majority. This world can be ours if we seek it and if we work together.  The principles of this world beyond terror can be found in the very first sentence of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This document declares that the “equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family [are] the foundation of freedom  justice and peace in the world”. One of the authors of this document was a Lebanese diplomat named Charles Malik  who would go on to become President of this Assembly. Mr. Malik insisted that these principles apply equally to all people  of all religions  in all regions — including the men and women of the Arab world that was his home.  In the nearly six decades since that document was approved  we have seen the forces of freedom and moderation transform entire continents. Sixty years after a terrible war  Europe is now whole  free and at peace  and Asia has seen freedom progress and hundreds of millions of people lifted out of desperate poverty. The words of the Universal Declaration are as true today as they were when they were written. As liberty flourishes  nations grow in tolerance  and hope  and peace. And we are seeing the bright future begin to take root in the broader Middle East.  Some of the changes in the Middle East have been dramatic  and we see the results in this Hall. Five years ago  Afghanistan was ruled by the brutal Taliban regime  and its seat in this body was contested. Now this seat is held by the freely elected Government of Afghanistan  which is represented today by President Karzai. Five years ago  Iraq’s seat in this body was   9 06-52731  held by a dictator who killed his citizens  invaded his neighbours and showed his contempt for the world by defying more than a dozen Security Council resolutions. Now Iraq’s seat is held by a democratic Government that embodies the aspirations of the Iraqi people  represented today by President Talabani. With these changes  more than 50 million people have been given a voice in this Hall for the first time in decades.  Some of the changes in the Middle East are happening gradually  but they are real. Algeria has held its first competitive presidential election  and the military remained neutral. The United Arab Emirates recently announced that half of its seats in the Federal National Council will be chosen by elections. Kuwait held elections in which women were allowed to vote and run for office for the first time. Citizens have voted in municipal elections in Saudi Arabia  in parliamentary elections in Jordan and Bahrain and in multiparty presidential elections in Yemen and in Egypt. These are important steps  and the Governments should continue to move forward with other reforms that show that they trust their people. Every nation that travels the road to freedom moves at a different pace  and the democracies they build will reflect their own cultures and traditions. But the destination is the same: a free society where people live at peace with each other and at peace with the world.  Some have argued that the democratic changes we are seeing in the Middle East are destabilizing the region. This argument rests on a false assumption: that the Middle East was stable to begin with. The reality is that the stability we thought we saw in the Middle East was a mirage. For decades  millions of men and women in the region have been trapped in oppression and hopelessness. And these conditions left a generation disillusioned and made this region a breeding ground for extremism.  Imagine what it is like to be a young person living in a country that is not moving toward reform. You are 21 years old  and while your peers in other parts of the world are casting their ballots for the first time  you are powerless to change the course of your Government. While your peers in other parts of the world have received educations that prepare them for the opportunities of a global economy  you have been fed propaganda and conspiracy theories that blame others for your country’s shortcomings. And everywhere you turn  you hear extremists who tell you that you can escape your misery and regain your dignity through violence and terror and martyrdom. For many across the broader Middle East  this is the dismal choice presented every day.  Every civilized nation  including those in the Muslim world  must support those in the region who are offering a more hopeful alternative. We know that when people have a voice in their future they are less likely to blow themselves up in suicide attacks. We know that when leaders are accountable to their people  they are more likely to seek national greatness in the achievements of their citizens  rather than in terror and conquest. So we must stand with democratic leaders and moderate reformers across the broader Middle East. We must give voice to the hopes of decent men and women who want for their children the same things we want for ours. We must seek stability through a free and just Middle East where the extremists are marginalized by millions of citizens in control of their own destinies.  Today  I would like to speak directly to the people across the broader Middle East. My country desires peace. Extremists in your midst spread propaganda claiming that the West is engaged in a war against Islam. This propaganda is false  and its purpose is to confuse you and justify acts of terror. We respect Islam  but we will protect our people from those who pervert Islam to sow death and destruction. Our goal is to help you build a more tolerant and hopeful society that honours people of all faiths and promotes peace.  To the people of Iraq: nearly 12 million of you braved the car bombers and assassins last December to vote in free elections. The world saw you hold up purple ink-stained fingers  and your courage filled us with admiration. You have stood firm in the face of horrendous acts of terror and sectarian violence  and we will not abandon you in your struggle to build a free nation. America and our coalition partners will continue to stand with the democratic Government you elected. We will continue to help you secure the international assistance and investment you need to create jobs and opportunity  working with the United Nations and through the International Compact with Iraq endorsed here in New York yesterday. We will continue to train those of you who stepped forward to fight the enemies of freedom. We will not yield the future of your country to terrorists and extremists. In return  your leaders must rise to the challenges your country is facing and make difficult choices to bring security and prosperity. Working together  we will help    06-52731 10  your democracy succeed  so that it can become a beacon of hope for millions in the Muslim world.  To the people of Afghanistan: together  we overthrew the Taliban regime that brought misery into your lives and harboured terrorists who brought death to the citizens of many nations. Since then  we have watched you choose your leaders in free elections and build a democratic Government. You can be proud of these achievements. We respect your courage and your determination to live in peace and freedom. We will continue to stand with you to defend your democratic gains.  Today  forces from more than 40 countries  including members of the NATO alliance  are bravely serving side by side with you against the extremists who want to bring down the free Government you have established. We will help you defeat these enemies and build a free Afghanistan that will never again oppress you or be a safe haven for terrorists.  To the people of Lebanon: last year  you inspired the world when you came out into the streets to demand your independence from Syrian dominance. You drove Syrian forces from your country and you re-established democracy. Since then  you have been tested by the fighting that began with Hizbollah’s unprovoked attacks on Israel. Many of you have seen your homes and your communities caught in crossfire. We see your suffering  and the world is helping you to rebuild your country and helping you deal with the armed extremists who are undermining your democracy by acting as a State within a State.  The United Nations has passed a good resolution that has authorized an international force  led by France and Italy  to help you restore Lebanese sovereignty over Lebanese soil. For many years  Lebanon was a model of democracy and pluralism and openness in the region — and it will be again.  To the people of Iran: the United States respects you. We respect your country. We admire your rich history  your vibrant culture and your many contributions to civilization. You deserve an opportunity to determine your own future  an economy that rewards your intelligence and your talents and a society that allows you to fulfil your tremendous potential. The greatest obstacle to this future is that your rulers have chosen to deny you liberty and to use your nation’s resources to fund terrorism  and fuel extremism  and pursue nuclear weapons.  The United Nations has passed a clear resolution requiring that the regime in Tehran meet its international obligations. Iran must abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. Despite what the regime tells you  we have no objection to Iran’s pursuit of a truly peaceful nuclear power programme. We are working toward a diplomatic solution to this crisis  and as we do  we look to the day when you can live in freedom and America and Iran can be good friends and close partners in the cause of peace.  To the people of Syria: your land is home to a great people with a proud tradition of learning and commerce. Today your rulers have allowed your country to become a crossroad for terrorism. In your midst  Hamas and Hizbollah are working to destabilize the region  and your Government is turning your country into a tool of Iran. This is increasing your country’s isolation from the world. Your Government must choose a better way forward by ending its support for terror  and living in peace with your neighbours  and opening the way to a better life for you and your families.  To the people of Darfur: you have suffered unspeakable violence  and my nation has called these atrocities what they are: genocide. For the last two years  America joined with the international community to provide emergency food aid and support for an African Union peacekeeping force. Yet your suffering continues. The world must step forward to provide additional humanitarian aid  and we must strengthen the African Union force that has done good work but is not strong enough to protect you. The Security Council has approved a resolution that would transform the African Union force into a blue-helmeted force that is larger and more robust. To increase its strength and effectiveness  NATO nations should provide logistics and other support. The regime in Khartoum is stopping the deployment of this force. If the Sudanese Government does not approve this peacekeeping force quickly  the United Nations must act. Your lives and the credibility of the United Nations are at stake. So today I am announcing that I am naming a presidential Special Envoy — former Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development  Andrew Natsios — to lead America’s efforts to resolve the outstanding disputes and help bring peace to your land.  The world must also stand up for peace in the Holy Land. I am committed to two democratic States    11 06-52731  Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security. I am committed to a Palestinian State that has territorial integrity and will live peacefully with the Jewish State of Israel. This is the vision set forth in the road map  and helping the parties to reach this goal is one of the great objectives of my presidency. The Palestinian people have suffered from decades of corruption and violence and the daily humiliation of occupation. Israeli citizens have endured brutal acts of terrorism and constant fear of attack since the birth of their nation. Many brave men and women have made the commitment to peace. Yet extremists in the region are stirring up hatred and trying to prevent these moderate voices from prevailing.  This struggle is unfolding in the Palestinian territories. Earlier this year  the Palestinian people voted in a free election. The leaders of Hamas campaigned on a platform of ending corruption and improving the lives of the Palestinian people  and they prevailed. The world is waiting to see whether the Hamas Government will follow through on its promises or pursue an extremist agenda. The world has sent a clear message to the leaders of Hamas: serve the interests of the Palestinian people  abandon terror  recognize Israel’s right to exist  honour agreements and work for peace.  President Abbas is committed to peace and to his people’s aspirations for a State of their own. Prime Minister Olmert is committed to peace  and has said he intends to meet with President Abbas to make real progress on the outstanding issues between them. I believe that peace can be achieved and that a democratic Palestinian State is possible. I hear from leaders in the region who want to help. I have directed Secretary of State Rice to lead a diplomatic effort to engage moderate leaders across the region to help the Palestinians reform their security services and support Israeli and Palestinian leaders in their efforts to come together to resolve their differences.  Prime Minister Blair has indicated that his country will work with partners in Europe to help strengthen the governing institutions of the Palestinian administration. We welcome his initiative. Countries like Saudi Arabia  Jordan and Egypt have made clear that they are willing to contribute the diplomatic and financial assistance necessary to help these efforts succeed. I am optimistic that  by supporting the forces of democracy and moderation  we can help Israelis and Palestinians build a more hopeful future and achieve the peace in the Holy Land that we all want.  Freedom  by its nature  cannot be imposed; it must be chosen. From Beirut to Baghdad  people are making the choice for freedom. And the nations gathered in this Hall must make a choice as well. Will we support the moderates and reformers who are working for change across the Middle East  or will we yield the future to the terrorists and extremists? America has made its choice: we will stand with the moderates and reformers.  Recently  a courageous group of Arab and Muslim intellectuals wrote me a letter. In it  they said this: “The shore of reform is the only one on which any lights appear  even though the journey demands courage  patience and perseverance”. The United Nations was created to make that journey possible. Together we must support the dreams of good and decent people who are working to transform a troubled region. And by doing so  we will advance the high ideals on which this institution was founded. "
"182",7280,"UZB",61,2006,"While acknowledging the unique and irreplaceable role played by the United Nations in international affairs  one still has to recognize the need to reform this institution according to present-day realities. Let me briefly dwell upon our vision of these reforms.  It is necessary to significantly increase the efficiency of the United Nations management  which must set itself realistic and feasible objectives and rapidly respond to challenges and threats. The reform of the Organization must reflect the principles of sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs and strengthen the equal cooperation between States. It must be based upon the principles of broad international consensus.  The General Assembly needs to concentrate on designing constructive ways of addressing the problems of regional and global security  which affect the interests of the majority of the Member States. Much attention should be given to questions of post-conflict rehabilitation and combating terrorism. The United Nations should assume a coordinating role in these spheres using the support of all Member States. Such an approach will contribute to strengthening the Organization’s ability to meet contemporary challenges.  Security Council reform must ensure the fair geographical and regional representation of both developed and developing States whose authority has been acknowledged by the international community and who play an important role in addressing the main tasks facing the Organization today.  The international community is about to make a decision on an important issue — the election of the new Secretary-General. Considering the principle of rotation and the increasing political weight and economic significance of the Asian countries  the Republic of Uzbekistan fully supports the view that a representative from the Asian group should assume that post. We support the candidature of the Minister forForeign Affairs and Trade of South Korea  Mr. Ban Ki-moon.   The international community places its hopes on the newly established Human Rights Council  which is called upon to improve the work of the United Nations in the field of human rights. It is important not to allow the Council to be used as a tool for promoting the interests of certain countries to the detriment of others. Only by stopping the practice of double standards  politicization and confrontation can we turn that body into the forum for equal and open dialogue  enjoying the trust of all Member States. The work of that United Nations body must be guided by objective and unbiased assessment of human rights issues. It must assist in elaborating constructive solutions to all problems that arise  instead of being used for political purposes.  The fundamental changes in today’s world are accompanied by the emergence of new challenges and threats. At present  terrorism  extremism and drug aggression pose a great danger to the sustainable development of States and peoples of the world.  The principal approaches of the Republic of Uzbekistan towards addressing these and other problems of security include the following points.  Uzbekistan firmly supports the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288)    15 06-53341  adopted by the General Assembly on 8 September 2006. Terrorism is not acceptable in any of its forms and manifestations. The fight against terrorism can be effective and efficient only by eliminating its causes  the first of which is the ideological and extremist centres that finance and direct the forces of international terrorism. We must also design common approaches to assessing this  the most dangerous phenomenon of today’s world.  A universal convention on international terrorism could become an effective basis for joint counteraction against the threat of terrorism. This instrument must be of a non-discriminatory nature  exclude the policy of double standards and call upon States for concerted action in countering the ideologies of extremism.  Maintenance of regional and global security is not possible without establishing comprehensive peace and stability in Afghanistan. One way to resolve the Afghan problem and restore a peaceful and neutral Afghanistan is effective and real progress in implementing concrete projects  funded by the international community  in the social  economic and humanitarian spheres — those spheres that can affect attitudes among the long-suffering people of Afghanistan.  A fundamental strategy review and more efficient coordination are required in combating one of the most dangerous problems: drug production and drug trafficking.  Uzbekistan  as an initiator of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region  together with its neighbours  is doing everything possible to strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. On 8 September 2006 in Semipalatinsk  the Central Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treat was signed. That initiative  put forward by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan  Islam Karimov  is a concrete contribution of the States in the region to strengthening the global non-proliferation process and also to creating a solid system of regional security. Uzbekistan calls upon nuclear powers to accede to the protocol on security guarantees annexed to the Central Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty as soon as possible. I wish to take this opportunity to express gratitude to the United Nations for its assistance in realizing this initiative.  Mr. Sow (Guinea)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  In closing  I express my sincere hope that the results of the work of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session will contribute to the successful realization of the joint efforts of the Member States in the struggle against threats and challenges to global security and to furthering the peaceful development of peoples.

"183",7292,"VAT",61,2006,"Not so long ago  it appeared that our world was growing at a pace beyond our control into a single global village. Today’s reality  by contrast  appears more and more fractured. Our efforts to overcome divisions and to harmonize differences have been hesitant. As the recent struggle between Israel and Hizbollah has tragically demonstrated  it is not so much the lack of peacemaking and peacekeeping experience and resources that leaves non-combatants to suffer and die. The more fundamental problem is the difficulty in moulding consistent political will on the part of the international community.  In the story of the Tower of Babel  the ancient world gives us an image of our current divided state. The confusion of tongues at Babel is the symbol of the divisions  misunderstandings and hostilities spawned  not by nature  but by human pride. Today  that same negative fundamental attitude has given rise to a new barbarism that is threatening world peace. Terrorists and their various organizations are the contemporary version of it  rejecting the best achievements our civilization has gained. In an order of quite a different nature  it cannot be denied that super-Powers  regional Powers  aspiring Powers and oppressed peoples  too  sometimes yield to the temptation to believe  despite historical evidence  that it is only force that can bring about a just ordering of affairs among peoples and nations.  The ideology of power can go so far as to regard the possession of nuclear weapons as an element of national pride  and it does not exclude the outrageous possibility of employing nuclear weapons against its adversaries. Meanwhile  the implementation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty appears to be stalled  and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty still needs to be ratified by some countries to enter into force.  This Organization was founded on a very different understanding of human affairs. Peace can only be achieved by shared labours aimed at securing a decent and dignified life for all. Due to the East-West struggle  the United Nations was able in the past to achieve only an impoverished sort of peace.  Recently  the Secretary-General’s proposals put this Organization on the path to reform; its lofty goals  however  will be reached only by overcoming the narrow confines imposed by the dominance of national interests  so that we may open ourselves to the vision of a world both reconciled and based on solidarity. In this spirit  the Holy See continues to be an advocate of the United Nations and favours its ongoing reform in the fields of peacebuilding  development and human rights. In the same spirit  the Holy See commends the decision to create the Peacebuilding Commission.  Too often  international bodies act  if at all  only after war is under way or when innocent populations have long been under assault. When the rights of whole groups of people are violated — grievous examples could be mentioned in Europe  Asia and Africa — or when they go unprotected by their own Governments     06-53952 32  it is entirely right and just that this Organization should intervene in a timely manner by suitable means to restore justice. The need to improve the system for effective humanitarian intervention in catastrophes brought on by war  civil conflict and ethnic strife will be an important test of the United Nations reform agenda.  Strengthening the capacity of this Organization to foresee conflicts  to resolve them through negotiation or to transform them non-violently before there is resort to force is  therefore  a goal of primary importance in the renewal of the Organization. In this regard  I regret to say that Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) of 11 August 2006  which was a very good resolution  could have been adopted with the same wording one month earlier. If repeated pleas for immediate cessation of the violence  made by many  including Pope Benedict XVI  had been acted upon  the killing of thousands of civilians and numerous young soldiers  the flight of peoples and the enormous indiscriminate devastation need not have occurred. Meanwhile  none of the outcomes that some Governments put forward as a reason for the continuation of hostilities in Lebanon have  in fact  been achieved.  As history has shown  for lack of sufficient capacity for intervention and common will  millions have died in needless conflicts — inutili stragi — that is  “pointless massacres”  to repeat a famous phrase used by Benedict XV  who was Pope during the First World War. The appeal by the late Pope Paul VI  uttered in this Hall on 4 October 1965 — “Jamais plus la guerre”  meaning “Never again war” — today rings like an accusation in the heart of the collective conscience of humanity.  The surest way to prevent war is to address its causes. It must not be forgotten that at the root of war there are usually real and serious grievances: injustices suffered; denial of human rights and absence of the rule of law; legitimate aspirations frustrated  and the exploitation of multitudes of desperate people who see no real possibility of improving their lot by peaceful means. How can we not be disturbed by the images of countless exiles and refugees living in camps and enduring subhuman conditions  or by those desperate groups which  intent upon seeking a less wretched future for themselves and their children  are driven to face the risks of illegal emigration? And what of the millions of people oppressed by misery and hunger and exposed to lethal epidemics  who continue to cry out to our sense of humanity? These  too  are challenges to our desire for peace.  The fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals and the resumption of the latest World Trade Organization (WTO) trade round promise economic progress  the alleviation of poverty  a reduction in terrorism and increased social harmony. Building peace for tomorrow requires that justice be done today.  Like development  the protection of human rights is an essential pillar in the edifice of world peace  for peace consists in people’s unimpeded enjoyment of their God-given rights. The Holy See hopes that the newly formed Human Rights Council will enhance the enjoyment of those rights by all peoples and by the citizens of every nation. Diversity among cultures allows for differences in the emphasis and implementation of human rights  but human nature  which is their foundation and is common to the whole of human society  permits no basic human right to be eclipsed or subordinated for the sake of other rights.   Every Government must clearly understand that violations of the fundamental rights of the person cannot be exempt from scrutiny by the international community under the pretext of the inviolability of a State’s internal affairs.  With respect to fundamental human rights  I would like to draw attention to three primary rights.  I turn first to the right to life. The increasing recognition of the sacredness of life  witnessed also by the growing rejection of the death penalty  needs to be matched by a thorough protection of human life precisely when it is at its weakest  that is  at its very beginning and at its natural end. Secondly  respect for religious freedom means respect for the intimate relationship of the believing person with God  in both its individual and social aspects. Indeed  there is nothing more sacred. Thirdly  there is the right to freedom of thought and expression  including freedom to hold opinions without interference and to exchange ideas and information and the consequent freedom of the press. The observance of this right is necessary for the fulfilment of each person  for the respect of cultures and for the progress of science. We must acknowledge  however  that not all fundamental rights — and in particular the three which I have mentioned — are adequately protected in every nation  and  in more than a few  they are openly denied  even among States sitting on the Human Rights Council.   33 06-53952   Although in some cases religion continues to be cynically exploited for political ends  it is my delegation’s firm belief that  at its best  truest and most authentic  religion is a vital force for harmony and peace among peoples. It appeals to the noblest aspects of human nature. It binds up the wounds of war  both physical and psychological. It provides sanctuary to refugees and hospitality to migrants. It weaves bonds of solidarity that overcome every form of mistrust  and through forgiveness it lends stability to once-divided societies.  Twenty years ago  the late Pope John Paul II brought together the leaders of the world’s religions to pray and to bear witness to peace. That collective witness was renewed in 1993 during the Bosnian war and in 2002 following the barbarous 11 September terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. More recently  on 23 July of this year  faced with the spreading war in Lebanon  Pope Benedict XVI invited Christians and all believers to join him in a day of prayer and penitence  imploring God for the gift of peace for the Holy Land and the Middle East.  In this past generation  leaders and adherents of the world’s religions have shown themselves time and again to be willing to dialogue and to promote harmony among peoples.  On Wednesday 20 September last  Pope Benedict XVI repeated his unequivocal support for inter-religious and intercultural dialogue and expressed the hope that what he had said at the University of Regensburg might be a boost and an encouragement for positive and even self-critical dialogue  both between religions and between modern reason and the faith of Christians. The Pope  as is well known  expressed sadness that some passages of his academic address could have lent themselves to misinterpretation. His real intention was to explain that it is not religion and violence  but religion and reason that go together  in the context of a critical vision of a society which seeks to exclude God from public life. Two days ago  while receiving the ambassadors of the countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) accredited to the Holy See  he added:   “The lessons of the past must … help us to seek paths of reconciliation  in order to live with respect for the identity and freedom of each individual  with a view to fruitful cooperation in the service of all humanity … respect and dialogue require reciprocity in all spheres  especially in that which concerns basic freedoms  more particularly religious freedom”.  If  on the one hand  religious motivation for violence  whatever its source  must be clearly and radically rejected  on the other it must be emphasized that in political life one cannot disregard the contribution of the religious vision of the world and of humanity. In fact  as the Pope affirmed  were reason to turn a deaf ear to the divine and relegate religion to the ambit of subcultures  it would automatically provoke violent reactions  and violent reactions are always a falsification of true religion.   It falls to all interested parties — to civil society as well as to States — to promote religious freedom and a sane social tolerance that will disarm extremists even before they can begin to corrupt others with their hatred of life and liberty. That will be a significant contribution to peace among peoples  because peace can be born only in the hearts of human beings.  Together with this heartfelt wish  it is my honour to conclude by conveying to you  Madam President  and to the peoples here represented the cordial greetings of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI. Upon the deliberations of this General Assembly  he invokes an abundance of Almighty God’s blessings. "
"184",7327,"VCT",61,2006,"Our President arises in this Assembly as a breath of fresh air and presides as an inspiration to women  particularly in the Middle East  and to human beings all over the world who treasure the stone that the builder rejects and that becomes the head cornerstone. I am sure that her presidency will make a positive and lasting impact on our General Assembly. I thank her very much for being and doing.  Humanity’s condition today is difficult  complex and challenging  yet pregnant with possibilities for a better future. Everywhere the faces of men and women are strained and anxious; yet  amidst the anxieties  pain and sorrows there is joyous laughter  which soothes the soul and summons the human race to embrace the promise of a redeeming grace  which eschews hate  greed  callousness  oppression  injustice and violence. It is still possible for this divided world of inequity and the inhumanity of man to man to sing with meaning our redemption song of peace and justice  prosperity and freedom  democracy and tolerance  unity amidst diversity  equality and mutual respect.  This quest to mend the broken world is grounded in the ideals that constitute the core of the United Nations. This idealism seeks not a world of perfection  but one of goodness  one of civilization over barbarism  of humanity over inhumanity. The world  especially the majority of its inhabitants who happen to be poor and disadvantaged amidst an orgy of plenty that resides in a minority  looks to the United Nations as their hope  as a brightness that illuminates  not blinds. I bring this simple but powerful message from a small  developing country in the nearby Caribbean Sea on behalf of the marginalized of the world  without the vanity of a pretentious hegemony  an arrogance of power  or a triumphalism of a presumed manifest destiny. It is both necessary and desirable to speak this truth to power.  So more than 80 per cent of the people who reside in the developing world  and  indeed  all right-thinking persons  want and demand in this regard coherent leadership from a reformed United Nations that is true to its central mandate to serve humanity well. Unfortunately  the reformation of the United Nations is moving at a snail’s pace  which frustrates its work  undermines its efficacy  and damages its credibility.  To be sure  some modest progress has been made by way of the establishment of a new Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. But  frankly  too much time is wasted on fussing and fighting on esoteric issues touching and concerning the so-called mandate review and management reform  rather than focusing on the critical matter of the implementation of the “development resolution” adopted by the General Assembly. In the process  too  let us have a reform of the Security Council that is meaningful and democratic.  The world’s marginalized and disadvantaged look askance at a United Nations that daily seeks to choreograph the dancing of angels on the head of a pin. They care very little for the bureaucratic harangue that the United Nations “system-wide coherence” has been addressed and enhanced  important as that may be for some professional diplomats. The world’s people want to know  and to see the practical evidence  that the United Nations is tackling in a purposeful way the issues of global poverty  environmental degradation  climate change  the empowerment of women  the protection of children  the promotion of peace and security  the HIV/AIDS pandemic  the provision of clean water and an adequate supply of food  among other such telling requisites.  Undoubtedly  many  if not most  of the Governments of the rich and powerful countries show signs of fatigue and disengagement towards the developing world. This is evident in their parsimony on official development assistance and their failure and/or neglect to advance meaningfully the Doha Development Round. Better must be done here.  Please note that my strictures are levelled at the Governments of those countries  and not their people or their civilizations. Sufficient persuasive evidence exists that the people in many  if not most  of these rich countries are sensitive to the concerns of the developing world  but their Governments do not sufficiently reflect these sensitivities  despite their occasional rhetoric to the contrary. Accordingly  the peoples and civilizations across national boundaries must link themselves in a tighter nexus or bond  with or without the mediating formal state apparatuses  and name and shame those Governments that ought to be named and shamed.   27 06-52988   In this regard  the proposal before the United Nations for an alliance of civilizations holds immense promise  provided that it is not captured by those states that hanker after an ignoble  unattainable  unsustainable and fundamentally immoral hegemony. Our Caribbean civilization  and its Vincentian component  stands ready and willing to be part of this magnificent quest for an ennobling brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.  While many rich countries turn aside from the development thrust of the world’s marginalized and disadvantaged  there is an encouraging trend towards more and better South-South cooperation. In the case of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  we are benefiting from a closer integration network through the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and the Caribbean Community Single Market and Economy. Further  countries such as Cuba  Venezuela  Mexico  Malaysia and Taiwan  among others  have special and model relations with our country.  Recently  at the Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement  held in Cuba  the leaders of this 118-member body redefined its purpose and mandate  in an increasingly unipolar world  to embrace a thorough-going development agenda and to facilitate the building of a more peaceful  just and secure architecture of international relations. This renewed enthusiasm of the Non-Aligned Movement strengthens the hands and voices of those who truly believe that a better  more civilized world is possible and nigh.  Next year  in March  people of African descent and all freedom-loving peoples and nations will commemorate and celebrate the two-hundredth anniversary of the passage of the act abolishing the British trade in African slaves to the Caribbean and the Americas. This is an occasion for historical reclamation and the righting of historic wrongs. The trade in  and enslavement of  Africans was a monstrous crime against humanity and an exercise in genocide unmatched in the history of the Western world.  European nations and their North American cousins have failed and/or refused to acknowledge this sufficiently or at all. There has been no apology for this crime against humanity and this genocide  conducted over a prolonged period. There has been no practical recompense in the form of reparations to the affected nations and peoples in Africa  the Caribbean and the Americas. Surely  this issue must be put squarely on the agenda of the United Nations for speedy resolution.  Without in any way diluting the force of this representation — indeed in bolstering it — we find it necessary and desirable to link it in our Caribbean region with the genocide of indigenous peoples  including the Callinago and the Garifuna of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  and the wholly wrong and inhumane exploitation by colonialism and imperialism of indentured labour from Africa  Madeira  India and China after the abolition of African slavery in the Caribbean. Europe has much to answer for on these matters  and should be made to answer properly and appropriately. Historic wrongs not righted remain scars on the soul of the oppressor and the oppressed alike  which continue to haunt over the ages; it is a hateful burden that must be lifted. This dark night must give way to a brightened day.  Of all the tragedies engulfing our modern world  few touch the human soul and spirit as does the condition of the people in Darfur and Palestine. The entire world knows who are responsible for the crimes against humanity in Darfur and in all areas of the Palestinian homeland. Yet the basic human and national rights of the people in those geographic regions are trampled upon daily by alien forces. Meanwhile  the United Nations appears helpless and its authority is undermined. Surely  the time is long past for a resolution of these conflicts  and other enduring conflicts worldwide  including Lebanon and Western Sahara. Oppression will not endure indefinitely. That is the powerful lesson of history. The people’s right to self-determination must be fully respected.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is pleased to see Haiti’s restoration to democracy. The cynical ouster of the former democratically elected President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide  in February 2004  ushered in immense suffering in Haiti under a so-called interim administration installed by imperialism. The Haitian people  who endureth for ever  must be applauded for their commitment to democracy and progress. Their election of President René Préval represents a strong rebuke of those who mistakenly believe that the dangling of money is everything. We heartily congratulate the new Haitian Government and pledge to work closely with it in its efforts to develop its heroic country  the land of Toussaint L’Ouverture.    06-52988 28   Saint Vincent and the Grenadines again pleads with the United Nations to permit Taiwan  a democratic and progressive country of 23 million people and a legitimate political expression of the Chinese civilization  to be accorded its rightful admission to the United Nations and its specialized agencies. There is no adequate justification for the continued exclusion of Taiwan from participation in the numerous global exchanges in the several international bodies  including the United Nations.  Further  the United Nations has a major role to play in ensuring an easing of tensions across the Taiwan straits. Aggressive conduct must be restrained in a context in which Taiwan is committed to peace and a comprehensive political dialogue.  Modern terrorism is a barbarism out of sync with civilized life. It affects adversely not only powerful nations  but developing ones in Asia  Africa  Latin America and the Caribbean. The evil of terrorism  including state-sponsored terrorism  must be fought relentlessly. It must be given no space to thrive. At the same time  terrorism must be attacked sensibly and not in a counter-productive way. Too many innocent lives have been lost through terrorist acts. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines pledges itself to continue to work resolutely and fearlessly  without hypocrisy  with all nations and the United Nations  to eliminate the dastardly scourge called terrorism and its causes.  Permit me to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his splendid work at the United Nations and throughout the world. His accomplishments have been immense  and we applaud him as his incumbency draws to a close. We wish him and his family well.  I conclude by reaffirming that it is our sacred duty to humanity and those unborn to ensure that we contribute to a safer  more peaceful  more prosperous  more civilized world. We who have come from yesterday with our limiting burdens must face tomorrow with our enabling strengths. We must never forget that in our work here at the United Nations it becomes possible to glimpse morning before the sun  possible to see early where sunset might stain anticipated night. Let us thus not sleep to dream  but dream to change the world  for the better. "
"185",7374,"VEN",61,2006,"First I very respectfully invite all those who have not done so to read the book that I am holding  one of the most recent by Noam Chomsky  who is among the most prestigious American and world intellectuals. The book  “Hegemony or Survival: America’s Quest for Global Dominance”  is an excellent work to help us understand what happened in the world of the twentieth century and what is happening now  which is the greatest threat looming over our planet: the hegemonistic claims of American imperialism  which threaten the very survival of the human species. We continue to warn about this danger and to appeal to the people of the United States and the world to halt this threat  which is like the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.  I had considered reading a chapter from the book  but to save time I shall confine myself to a recommendation. The book is very good  an easy read. I am sure  Madam President  that you are familiar with it. It is published in English  German  Russian and Arabic. The first people who should read it are our brothers and sisters in the United States  because the threat is in their own house. The Devil is there; the Devil himself is in the house.  The Devil came here yesterday  right here. It still smells of sulphur today. Yesterday on this rostrum the President of the United States  whom I refer to as the Devil  talked as if he owned the world. It would be appropriate to have a psychiatrist analyse yesterday’s address by the President of the United States. As the spokesman of imperialism he came to share his prescriptions for preserving the current pattern of domination  exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world. It was like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. I would even propose a title: “The Devil’s Recipe”.  As Chomsky says here clearly and in depth  American imperialism is doing all it can to consolidate its hegemonistic system of domination. We cannot allow it to do that. We cannot allow the establishment and consolidation of world dictatorship. The address of the world tyrant  cynical and full of hypocrisy  shows the imperialists’ intention to control everything. They say that they want to impose a democratic model  but it is the democratic model of their own conception: the false democracy of elites  and furthermore an original democratic model imposed by bombs  bombardments and invasions. What a strange democracy! It would be necessary to revise the ideas of Aristotle and the other Greek pioneers of democracy in the face of this model  imposed by marines  invasions  aggression and bombs.  The President of the United States told us yesterday in this Hall  “everywhere you turn you hear extremists who tell you that you can escape your misery and retain your dignity through violence and terror and martyrdom.” (see ). Wherever he looks he sees extremists  and when he looks at your colour  my brother  he thinks “You are an extremist”. Mr. Evo Morales Aima  the worthy President of Bolivia  looks like an extremist to him. The imperialists see extremists everywhere.  No  it is not that we are extremists. What is happening is that the world is waking up and people everywhere are rising up. I tell the world dictator “I have a feeling that the rest of your days will be a living nightmare  because everywhere you will see us rising up against American imperialism  demanding freedom  equality of peoples and respect for the sovereignty of nations.” Yes  we may be described as extremists  but we are rising against the empire  against the model of domination.   11 06-52879   The President also said  “I would like to speak directly to the people across the … Middle East: my country desires peace.” That is true. If we walk through the streets of the Bronx  New York  Washington  San Diego  California  San Antonio and San Francisco — anywhere in the United States — and speak to individual citizens  we shall find that the country does want peace. The difference is that the Government of the United States does not. It wants to impose its system of exploitation and pillage and its hegemony through war. If it wants peace  what is happening in Iraq? What happened in Lebanon and Palestine? What has happened over the past hundred years in Latin America and in world? Now there are new threats against Venezuela and Iran.  The President spoke to the people of Lebanon  saying “Many of you have seen your homes and communities caught in crossfire.” What cynicism! What a capacity to lie shamelessly! Was it crossfire when bombs were dropped on Beirut with millimetric precision? He was thinking of a Western  where men shoot from the hip and somebody gets caught in the crossfire. This was imperialist fire  fascist fire  the fire of an assassin  the genocidal firing of the empire and Israel on the innocent people of Palestine and Lebanon. That is the truth.  Now it is said that we are suffering because we see homes destroyed. Early this morning I was looking at some statements in preparing my remarks  and I have brought with me a document in which I note that the President of the United States came to talk to the peoples. He said “To the people of Afghanistan”  “To the people of Lebanon”  “To the people of Iran”. He addressed them all directly. One wonders what those peoples would tell him if they were given the opportunity. What would they have to say? I know what is in the soul of the peoples of the south  the oppressed peoples. They would say “Yankee imperialist  go home!” That would be the cry of the peoples of the world if they could speak with one voice to the American imperialists.  That is why last year when I came to this Hall  as I have been doing for the past eight years  I said something that has now been fully confirmed. Hardly anybody here can defend the United Nations system. Let us be honest and accept that the system born after the Second World War has collapsed. It is worthless. It is true that it serves to bring us together once a year to meet  make statements  prepare long documents  reflect and listen to good speeches like those yesterday by President Evo and President Lula and the ones we have just heard from the President of Sri Lanka and the President of Chile. But the Assembly has been turned into a merely deliberative organ  with no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world.  That is why Venezuela once again proposes here today  20 September  that we re-establish the United Nations. Last year we made four modest proposals that we felt were crucially important for discussion by heads of State and Government  ambassadors and representatives.  The first — President Lula said this yesterday — is the expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Security Council  with developed and under-developed countries of the third world as new permanent members. That is the first step.  Secondly  there must be effective methods to address and resolve world conflicts  with transparent debate and decision-making.  Thirdly  it is essential that  as everyone demands  there be an immediate end to the anti-democratic mechanism of the veto that is exercised when decisions are made in the Security Council. Let me give a recent example. The immoral veto of the United States  blocking a resolution  allowed the Israeli forces to destroy Lebanon with impunity before our very eyes.  Fourthly  as we have always said  the role and powers of the Secretary-General must be strengthened. Yesterday the Secretary-General practically gave us his farewell speech. He recognized that in the past 10 years serious world problems such as hunger  poverty  violence and human rights violations had worsened and become more complicated. That is a terrible consequence of the collapse of the United Nations system and American hegemonistic pretensions.  A few years ago Venezuela decided to wage this battle within the United Nations  recognizing the United Nations  as Members  and lending it our voice and our thinking. Our voice is an independent one representing dignity  the search for truth and the reformulation of the international system  with denunciation of persecution and of the aggression of hegemonistic forces against peoples of the planet.  That is how Venezuela  the homeland of Bolivar  came to put itself forward for a non-permanent seat on    06-52879 12  the Security Council. The United States Government launched open  immoral aggression throughout the world to try to prevent Venezuela being freely elected to a seat on the Security Council. The empire is afraid of the truth  of independent voices. It calls us extremists  but it is the extremist.  I should like to thank all those countries that have announced their support for Venezuela even though the ballot is secret and there is no need to make an announcement. I believe that the open attack by the United States empire has increased the support of many countries  and that support strengthens the morale of Venezuela  our people and Government. Our brothers in the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR)  for example  have expressed their support as a bloc. With Argentina  Brazil  Paraguay and Uruguay  as well as many other Latin American countries  such as Bolivia  Venezuela is now a full member of MERCOSUR. The Caribbean Community has expressed its support for Venezuela  as has the Arab League. I am immensely grateful to our Arab and Caribbean brothers. The African Union  almost all of Africa  has expressed support for Venezuela  as have countries such as Russia  China and many others.  On behalf of Venezuela and its people  and of the truth  I thank them all most warmly. With a seat on the Security Council  Venezuela will make not only its voice but that of the third world and all peoples heard throughout the world. We will defend dignity and truth.  Over and above all this  there are reasons to be optimistic — a poet would say “hopelessly optimistic”. Beyond the threats  the bombs  the wars  aggression  preventive war and the destruction of entire peoples  we can see that a new era is dawning. As Silvio Rodriguez sings  “the era is giving birth to a heart”. New trends are developing  alternative ways of thinking  alternative movements. Young people think differently. As has been shown in scarcely a decade  the idea of the end of history has been shown to be totally false  as has that of the Pax Americana and the establishment of the capitalist neo-liberal model  which creates poverty and is rejected.  Now we must define the future of the world. The dawn is breaking all over: Latin America  Africa  Europe and Oceania. I want to emphasize that optimistic vision  so that we may strengthen our will and our readiness to fight to save the world and build a new and better world.  Venezuela joins that struggle  and that is why we are threatened. The United States has already planned  financed and set in motion a coup in Venezuela  and it continues to support coup attempts and terrorism there. President Michelle Bachelet Jeria reminded us a short time ago of the horrendous assassination of the former Chilean Foreign Minister  Orlando Letelier. I would simply add that those who perpetrated that crime  in which an American citizen also died  are free. And they are Americans themselves  CIA terrorists.  We should also recall that in a few days there will be another anniversary: 30 years will have passed since another horrendous terrorist act  the destruction of an airliner of Cubana de Aviación in which 73 innocent people died. Where is the biggest terrorist of this continent  who masterminded the blowing up of the plane? He spent a few years in prison in Venezuela  but thanks to the CIA and Venezuelan Government officials at the time he was able to escape. Now he lives in the United States  protected by the Government. He confessed and was convicted of his crime  but the United States Government has double standards and protects terrorism when it wants to. I say this to make the point that Venezuela is fully committed to combating terrorism and violence  and joins those peoples that are fighting for peace and a world of equals.  I have just spoken of the Cuban airliner. Luis Posada Carriles is the name of the terrorist concerned. He is protected here  as are very corrupt people who have fled Venezuela. A group of terrorists bombed various embassies and assassinated people. During the attempted coup they kidnapped me and were going to shoot me. But God intervened  as did a group of loyal soldiers and the people  who took to the streets. So by a miracle I am here today. The leaders of that attempted coup and those terrorist acts are living in this country today  protected by the United States Government. I accuse the American Government of protecting terrorists and of holding a completely cynical discourse.  I mentioned Cuba. I was very recently in Havana for a few days  and I left it feeling happy because the birth of a new era could be seen. The Non-Aligned Movement summit adopted a historic final document. Do not worry; I shall not read it out. It contains a set of resolutions adopted after open and transparent debate. More than 50 heads of State attended  and Havana was the capital of the south for a week.   13 06-52879   We have now relaunched the Non-Aligned Movement. If there is anything I could ask of all those here  my partners and brothers and sisters  it is that they lend their good will to strengthen the Non-Aligned Movement  which is important for the birth of the new era and the prevention of hegemony and imperialism. The Assembly will know that we elected President Fidel Castro Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement for the next three years  and we can trust him to lead us very efficiently. Those who hoped that Fidel would die were disappointed  and they will continue to be disappointed  because he is back in his olive-green fatigues and is now not only President of Cuba but Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. A very strong movement has been born: that of the South. We are men and women of the South.  With these documents  ideas  criticisms and reflections  I am now closing my file and taking the book with me. Do not forget that I recommend it very warmly and very humbly to all those present. I have tried to put forward ideas to save our planet  to save it from the imperialist threat. I hope that in this century  in the not too distant future  we shall see our children and grandchildren living better  in a world of peace based on the fundamental principles of the United Nations — a renewed and relocated United Nations. I believe that it must move to another country  to a city of the South. That is what we in Venezuela have proposed. The Assembly knows that my personal doctor and chief of security had to stay on a locked plane. Neither was allowed to come to the United Nations. This abuse we regard as a personal insult by the Devil. It smells of sulphur here  but God is with us  and I embrace you all. May God bless us all. "
"186",7413,"VNM",61,2006,"Madam President  at the outset  on behalf of the Vietnamese delegation  may I extend our warmest congratulations to you  the third woman in United Nations history to be elected as President of the General Assembly. I am confident that  under your wise leadership  this sixty-first session will be crowned with success. I also wish to convey our deep appreciation for the tremendous efforts undertaken and active contributions made by His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson during his presidency of the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.  As His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan’s last term of duty as Secretary-General of the United Nations comes to a close  I wish  on behalf of the Vietnamese Government  to express our deep appreciation for his dedication and commitment to our Organization. His visit to Viet Nam last May was another milestone in the history of the ever-growing Viet Nam-United Nations cooperative relationship.  The 2005 World Summit lit up our hopes for the achievement by the international community of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set out by our leaders at the Millennium Summit in 2000. One year has elapsed  and  regrettably  the picture of the world we see today is made up of paradoxes. Although the trend of peace  cooperation and development continues to prevail  so do the unilateral use of force  escalation of regional and ethnic conflicts and international terrorism. We have also seen serious hardships faced by developing countries under the pressure of globalization  and inequality in international economic relations. Poverty  epidemics  drugs and transnational crime pose even greater threats to hundreds of millions of people around the world.  Against this backdrop  in the view of the Vietnamese delegation  continued joint efforts to create a favourable environment for the achievement of the MDGs are even more imperative. We consider the theme chosen for this sixty-first session of the General Assembly  focusing on global partnership for development  to be highly relevant.  Peace and socio-political stability are indispensable to development. In turn  positive economic development and improved living standards of people help to consolidate peace and stability in every country and region and the world as a whole. It is essential that nations work together to settle differences and disputes through dialogue  abandon the use of force in their relations and fully comply with the United Nations Charter and international law in order to build a peaceful and stable environment in the interest of all.  I wish to reaffirm Viet Nam’s strong support for efforts to reach early peaceful settlements of international and regional conflicts and differences  including the nuclear issues on the Korean Peninsula and in Iran  and the crisis in the Middle East  where the recent hostilities in Lebanon  which caused heavy loss of innocent life and destruction of the country’s infrastructure  serve as a typical example of harm brought about by unilateral actions.  In this connection  I wish to state Viet Nam’s consistent policy of supporting the just struggle of the Palestinian people for their inalienable rights. I call on all parties concerned to implement the United Nations   33 06-53341  Security Council resolutions on the Middle East  including resolution 1701 (2006)  and soon arrive at a fair and lasting solution for peace and stability in the region.  Viet Nam is deeply concerned by the upsurge of terrorism in the world. We will continue to support the joint efforts of the international community to combat terrorism on the basis of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law  as well as respect for national sovereignty. The deep roots of terrorism  including poverty  inequality and injustice  must be eliminated. What should also be mentioned here is the unfortunate reality that  in many cases  the suppression of terrorist organizations  including those targeting Viet Nam  is being undertaken selectively  with double standards. It is our view that such conduct may leave room for more international terrorist acts.  Achievements in science and technology  especially information technology  and globalization have brought about great opportunities for all countries. They have also brought about the dark side of international economic relations. A widened development gap between the rich and the poor poses potential threats to world peace and security. In the Outcome Document of the 2005 World Summit  our leaders called for the establishment of a global partnership for development to enhance cooperation in all financial  trade and investment areas and called for increased assistance to developing countries  considering that such steps by the international community would contribute to establishing a favourable environment for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Such global partnership is yet to be seen  and we are concerned with increasing adverse impacts of globalization. The failure of the Doha Round  the strengthening of protectionism in a number of developed countries and fluctuating oil and gold prices are causing more and more difficulties for developing nations in their efforts to achieve the MDGs. A typical example of this situation is the anti-dumping tariff imposed on Vietnamese catfish and shrimp in past years and on footwear at present; this measure is affecting the lives of millions of poor people. It runs counter to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and the spirit of trade liberalization pursued by Member States. It should also be pointed out that the increased integration of developing nations in the world economy is indeed an important element in ensuring the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).   Developing countries should be supported and assisted to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) as early as possible. Non-tariff barriers under the guise of hygiene and safety standards  among others  should be removed to facilitate developing countries to access the markets of the developed economies. We have on many occasions expressed our view that  in our times  embargo and sanctions are completely obsolete policies. We once again call for an early lifting of the unilateral economic and trade embargo against Cuba.  Viet Nam welcomes the fact that a number of countries have set up road maps to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance without any conditions. Technology transfer  capacity-building and human resource development should be further promoted. We welcome initiatives to settle the debts of poor countries  the solutions outlined in the Monterrey Consensus and the recent efforts of the international community towards this end. The United Nations should work out  especially at the national level  measures to further incorporate the MDGs in the implementation of global commitments undertaken during the past decade in the areas of women  children  population  development  HIV/AIDS prevention  housing  environment and social development.  Viet Nam supports efforts to strengthen multilateral mechanisms in which the United Nations plays a central role with a view to building and ensuring a peaceful and stable environment in the world. The United Nations should be reformed to improve its effectiveness  democratization and modes of operation on the basis of the fundamental principles enshrined in its Charter.   While welcoming initial successes in the United Nations reform process  such as the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission  we realize that much remains to be done. Measures are needed to consolidate the central role and power of the General Assembly. The Security Council should also be reformed in both its composition and methods of work to ensure that it really represents the concerns and interests of all United Nations Members as stipulated in the Charter.    06-53341 34   Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in implementing the MDGs and we are in a good position to meet the 2015 deadline. Based on our own experience  we believe that each country should  first and foremost  strive to create and maintain a peaceful environment for development  mobilize broad participation by people of all walks of life in poverty reduction efforts and reserve preferential treatments for the poor  vulnerable groups and people living in remote and difficult areas  with a view to helping them catch up with the majority. Furthermore  effective prevention of natural disasters and mitigation of their consequences are crucial factors.  To create a peaceful environment for national development  Viet Nam will continue with its foreign policy of sovereign independence  peace  cooperation and development. We continue to be a friend and reliable partner of all countries in the international community striving for peace and cooperation and we will continue to actively participate in regional and international cooperation.   We are in the final stage leading to accession to the World Trade Organization. Viet Nam is also running for non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council for the term 2008-2009. In pursuing our policy of international integration and in contributing to the common endeavours of the international community  we look forward to continued support from all Members of the United Nations.  "
"187",7444,"VUT",61,2006,"Today  we stand on the verge of global uncertainty. The international landscape is scarred by wars  conflict  civil unrest  epidemics  drought and famine. Poverty and malnutrition continue to ravage the lives of millions of the world’s inhabitants.  The very values and fabric on which the United Nations was founded are being besieged by new ideas and principles that are undermining the authority of this body to maintain global peace and security. The clash of ideologies and of cultural and religious differences continues to give much food for thought. The United Nations stands at a crossroads. While it has the mandate to address those challenges  it remains paralysed as a result of actions taken by the hegemonic Powers of today. That is the dilemma confronting the Organization.  The value of the human person and his or her right to live in a world that is fair and just seems but a dream. Ensuring the dignity of one’s right to live with access to the most basic necessities in life remains our greatest challenge. We speak so ambitiously of creating a world that is equitable and just  but the outcomes have been unimpressive.  The schism between the minority rich and the majority poor continues to grow. The multitudes of the disadvantaged are being further marginalized from the so-called benefits of globalization. Fear has struck many small countries of the developing world. It is not the fear that the developing world has no capabilities in contributing to peace and security  but the fear — the greatest fear  in fact — that the undemocratic practices of the major United Nations organs  such as the Security Council  are causing tension and disarray in the work of the United Nations.  The disparities in the quality of life between the haves and the have-nots have grown to be fertile breeding grounds for new and hostile generations. And it is here that the phenomenon of terrorism continues to challenge the frontiers of our imagination. It is perhaps much clearer today than ever before that there are reasons for increased resentment in certain parts of the world.  My Government condemns terrorism in whatever form or manifestation it assumes  and there is an urgent need for all the Members of the United Nations to work together openly in combating those dangerous developments. The destruction of innocent lives should not be the means to meeting an end. That is inhumane. All United Nations Member countries therefore have the responsibility — a moral and ethical responsibility — to eradicate that menace from the face of the Earth.    06-53615 2   Peace cannot be won through injustice  the practice of double standards  aggression or war. We cannot be victorious in the fight against terrorism if we fail to address its root causes. Conversely  it is incumbent on all Member States to act responsibly to ensure the implementation of all United Nations resolutions. Moreover  if we are to have any hope of building a better future  then peace must sometimes come at a price.  We must begin to look deeply  honestly and with open hearts if we are really to understand the world around us. If there is a question of repressive policies that influence and dominate the international economic and political order  then those concerned must take remedial action. The adoption of the resolution on the United Nation’s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is therefore a positive step forward.  The central focus on the fight against terrorism has taken centre stage for some  and the diversion of resources is jeopardizing the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and official development assistance target levels. Accessibility to the markets of the affluent nations has also restricted the progress of development in many countries of the developing world. Major world players must not lose sight of those goals.  Inter-State relations  mutual understanding and tolerance begin with respect for the individual. The dignity of the human person is of the essence in building equality between all persons. That is one of the fundamental principles of the United Nations. As Members of the United Nations  we have all agreed to embrace those principles and we continue to believe in those values. Vanuatu joined the United Nations in 1981 because it believed in the Organization. Today  I stand before the Assembly to again reaffirm faith in the United Nations  but I agree that changes must take place to adapt the United Nations system to the evolution of the international and geopolitical and economic framework.  Reforms of the various United Nations bodies are therefore absolutely essential. There must be reform of the Security Council to ensure that it is democratic and more representative of the United Nations membership. The veto power in the Council dilutes all the good intentions of the majority of the United Nations membership towards addressing many of the challenges confronting us today. The underlying question  though  is: Has the disproportionate use of the veto power sustained reasonable levels of international peace and stability?  Cultural and religious differences cannot be seen to be obstacles in that regard. The United Nations brought civility and etiquette to the conduct of relations between States  and central to that are relations between individuals. The art of statesmanship has therefore become very critical at this time. Respect must therefore begin here at the United Nations. When one world Power speaks here  this Hall is jammed. Thereafter  the debate becomes routine. That is remiss of many of us. The annual general debate of the General Assembly is the only practical occasion at which almost all leaders are together in one place to discuss and share views on the development challenges facing the globe. The United Nations is not about one or several nations; it is about this family of nations with the one common objective of maintaining international peace and security.  Over the past few days  millions around the globe have monitored the unfolding debate in this noble Hall of the General Assembly. A war of words has resounded from this rostrum  exposing an alarming rift in relations between some super-Powers and the voices of the developing world. The media have exploited the situation to scrutinize those events  often ending up with gross assumptions and conclusions that have only instilled fear amongst the world’s innocent population. Now  is that the right message of hope we are giving to our peoples  who have faith in the United Nations? Is the United Nations not the beacon of hope for all humanity?  Confrontation must be resolved through tactful diplomacy and negotiation consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and established international law. In that spirit  we also appeal to those concerned to exercise great restraint and to have the wisdom and responsibility to ensure above all that any action they take serves that purpose  which must be in the interest of future global justice  peace and security. Any retreat from multilateralism will result only in increased tension and aggression. Again  mutual dialogue through appropriate mechanisms is absolutely critical at this very delicate time.  On the question of the Middle East  both Israel and Palestine have the right to live side by side in   3 06-53615  peaceful coexistence as independent and sovereign States. The international community must be realistic about the future. Let us allow justice  security and long-lasting peace to prevail for both the Israeli people and the Palestinians.  Recently  Vanuatu was recognized by the Happy Planet Index  published by the British-based New Economics Foundation  as the happiest place on Earth. We are proud to have been placed so high amongst all countries of the world  but we have been careful not to be carried away  and so often it is that island paradox that conceals the diverse development challenges that small island countries of the Pacific  such as Vanuatu  face in today’s world of globalization.  Last week  during the High-Level Meeting on the Midterm Comprehensive Global Review of the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries  I spoke of the many challenges facing my country in the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. Vanuatu has been showing positive signs of gradual economic growth. However  in the light of our vulnerability to natural disasters  exogenous market demand and supply price fluctuations and their adverse impacts on the three most important sectors contributing to our gross domestic product  we consider this an inappropriate time to include Vanuatu in the list of countries eligible for graduation.  Furthermore  while the current methods used to measure the three main thresholds for graduation are dependent on statistical variables  it is commonly understood that statistical data for countries in the Pacific — including Vanuatu — contain major discrepancies. Therefore  relying solely on such data to determine Vanuatu’s achievements in relation to the thresholds would yield inaccurate results.  Very soon  the General Assembly will be considering countries recommended for inclusion in the list of countries eligible for graduation. That list includes Vanuatu. Our arguments for exclusion from the list are well founded and based on practical realities. My Government considers as premature the recommendation by the Committee for Development Policy to include Vanuatu on the list. We therefore call upon Members of the United Nations to understand and support Vanuatu’s case.  As a responsible United Nations Member  Vanuatu is also contributing towards international peace and security. Vanuatu peacekeepers have participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and East Timor  and we currently have peacekeepers stationed in the Congo  Haiti  Côte d’Ivoire and the Sudan. Vanuatu has also participated in regional peacekeeping missions in Bougainville and Solomon Islands. Those efforts illustrate Vanuatu’s resolve to engage in peacekeeping and peacebuilding in both the regional and international contexts.  With regard to the question of the environment — in particular global warming and climate change — my Government strongly aligns itself with other small island States in urging the international community to reduce emissions. The failure of major emitters to sign the Kyoto Protocol is a major disappointment.  The Charter of the United Nations espouses the principles that continue to guide the Organization’s efforts in the process of self-determination. It calls for recognition of and respect for the fundamental rights of peoples and territories still under colonial rule. We must not lose sight of that goal. The United Nations must make renewed efforts where it has failed to allow justice to prevail for those peoples who continue to be denied their inalienable right to freedom and democracy. We must relegate that dark legacy to the past.    Determining how to bring more cohesiveness and unity to this great community of nations has now become a much more formidable challenge. I affirm my support for the challenging exercise before us. Our Almighty Creator entrusted us  the human race  with the safeguarding of a great asset  the Earth. It is incumbent on us to make the most of that opportunity. The world’s destiny is in our hands. In that spirit  I extend my congratulations to Montenegro on its admission as the 192nd Member of the United Nations.  Before closing  I would like to acknowledge the support of our development partners — in particular Australia  New Zealand  France  Japan  the People’s Republic of China  the United States of America and the European Union — as well as the various United Nations bodies that are strongly supporting the development of Vanuatu. I also extend our appreciation to India  Thailand  Malaysia  Singapore and Indonesia for their continuous support within the framework of South-South cooperation. In addition  my Government is encouraged by the initiative and the kind gesture of Venezuela in committing $2 million to the Pacific    06-53615 4  islands through the work programme of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Those are positive developments that together are complementing the leadership role being played by my Government in its development path.  In closing  I take this final opportunity to pay our respects to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his outstanding stewardship of the United Nations. His wisdom has ensured that the United Nations will retain its credibility and its relevance. During periods of turbulence and uncertainty  he has been relentless in the pursuit of his belief in United Nations reform. My Government salutes him for his distinguished service to the United Nations. We wish him all the best in his future endeavours. "
"188",7476,"WSM",61,2006,"Forty-four years ago  Samoa became independent  and when we joined the United Nations it was a reaffirmation of our support for the principle of multilateral cooperation which the United Nations embodied. It was also our statement that all States matter  that none was too small and weak to be represented in the United Nations on equal terms with the large and strong nations of the world. Those sentiments underpinned Samoa’s belief in the United Nations as an expanding global family and its Member States as the custodians entrusted with the future of our world and the generations to come.   In essence  lasting peace and the sustained prosperity of the world depended on harmonious cooperation and effective global partnership amongst all nations. Those were the ideals that motivated us to be part of the united family of nations  and they remain relevant and valid for our country today.  A year ago  we met here in an act of solidarity  to chart a new course for our Organization that is aligned to meet the emerging challenges confronting our world today. Our Summit Outcome document was not just a road map to guide the work of our Organization. While it mirrored the intergovernmental nature and diverse membership of our Organization  the document  ultimately  was a reminder of the cooperative and shared interests we all have regarding issues vital to the United Nations and its Member States. It also brought to bear the importance of global partnerships in these times of interdependence  for the achievement   15 06-53005  of sustainable development and peace and security for our peoples.  In less than twelve months  we have transformed rhetoric into reality. Solid progress has been made in the implementation of the Summit document. The Human Rights Council and the Peacebuilding Commission are now operational; credible reforms in the Secretariat and management have been implemented; a Central Emergency Response Fund has been set up; and a Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy had been unanimously adopted. But  as we well know  that is just the start; the real work lies ahead. In our view  it is imperative that even in the early stages of their work  those bodies must immediately adhere to the guiding principles of respect  integrity  credibility and professionalism to ensure that the objectives of relevance  efficiency and transparency envisioned for the Organization are delivered.  Development  security and human rights are the three pillars of the United Nations. All are mutually reinforcing. The United Nations commitment to the achievement of these goals  particularly for the least developed countries (LDCs) and the developing countries  is set out in a number of internationally agreed initiatives such as the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries  the Johannesburg Plan of Action  the Millennium Development Goals  and the Mauritius Strategy for Small Island Developing States.  Those development frameworks provide for global partnerships for the achievement  in small and vulnerable economies  of economic growth  sustainable development and the resilience to endure external shocks. Samoa looks forward to the implementation of the partnerships indicated in the development frameworks approved by the United Nations.   In Samoa’s case  the implementing framework for the partnerships of the Government with the donor community  civil society and the private sector are designed to address the development priorities of our country as set out in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa. It is through such partnerships that we look too  for the effective delivery of programmes that address major health challenges such as HIV/AIDS and the potential threat of the avian bird flu. Similarly  there is the collaborative work with our partners to support the empowerment of our women.  As to security and the specific context of stability and harmony within communities  I cannot overemphasize the importance of global actions to control and limit the availability of small arms weapons. These weapons in the hands of the wrong people can easily destabilize communities and plunge small nations into deadly conflict. We therefore renew our call for the early implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent  Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.   During the review of the Brussels Programme of Action this week  I shared with Member States the challenges that continue to confront my country. Samoa is both a least developed country and a very small island developing State. The United Nations has received a proposal for Samoa to be graduated from the list of LDCs. However  the vulnerabilities and the fragility that characterize our small island economy  as reflected in Samoa’s poor ranking under various economic vulnerability indices have  not gone away.  Working closely with our traditional development partners  we have tried our best to develop and manage our economy  and we have made good strides in improving the welfare of our people. But we know very well from grim past experience that it takes just one devastating disaster to wipe out our modest achievements and set back the economy for years. Our request  therefore  is for Samoa’s graduation from the list of LDCs to be deferred and reconsidered when Samoa has met the graduation threshold according to the economic vulnerability index.  Last week we broke new ground with the discussion for the first time in the United Nations context of the multidimensional aspects of international migration and development. The enthusiasm to consider migration and development as a priority concern in the United Nations agenda was well supported. The concrete outcomes that emerged from that initiative will ultimately depend on the willingness of the source countries and the destination countries to work out imaginative and humane arrangements beneficial to both.  The significance of international migration  whether permanent or temporary  as a development option for our region has not escaped the attention of Pacific leaders. It is also an option that raises difficult issues that touch on the welfare and humanitarian    06-53005 16  treatment of migrants  as well as on sensitive considerations on the part of receiving countries.  In just six years into the millennium  it has become more and more evident that many of the challenges we face have significant global dimensions. They are borderless  do not discriminate between developed and developing countries and have no respect for national sovereignty. Those global concerns  imaginatively called problems without passports  include climate change  epidemics  humanitarian concerns  conflict containment  security concerns and terrorism. By their very nature  the successful resolution of those challenges requires a collective and concerted effort of the whole United Nations membership  because no one country or group of countries is capable of tackling them alone.  Terrorism  in its various forms and manifestations  is responsible for the horror and fear that has gripped the world’s attention in recent years. No country is immune to the reaches of terrorism and we are all affected in varying degrees. We must continue to be resolute in our fight against terrorism. Let us reiterate in the strongest terms possible that terrorist acts  committed under whatever pretext or purpose  can never be justified as morally acceptable. Equally  countering terrorism does not confer immunity from the rule of law  nor the abandonment of the principles of a civilized society.  The unanimous adoption of a United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy two weeks ago was both a condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and a commitment by Member States to take concrete preventative measures  collectively and individually. The work ahead is to turn commitment into implementation.  The Middle East conflict continues to defy attempts to usher in a new era of trust and hopeful beginnings for the region. Sustainable peace remains an elusive goal  permanently out of our Organization’s reach as long as the root causes of the problem are not addressed. Too much is at stake.   Let us not forget the voiceless majority  unwillingly caught in the crossfire of the conflict  who yearn for a lasting peace. We should  therefore  not be judgmental or partisan in our approach. Ultimately  the Palestinian people need a permanent and an independent State  living in peace  with a secure Israel. The Security Council  by responding decisively to recent developments in the Lebanon-Israel conflict  gives us hope that perhaps an eventual resolution of that long drawn-out conflict is finally within sight.  The humanitarian and security situation in Darfur is a cause for concern. The recent resolution adopted by the Security Council will  we hope  be agreeable to all the parties with a genuine desire to expeditiously resolve the issue.  We continue to hope that the elected Governments of Iraq and Afghanistan will ultimately succeed in achieving conditions that will allow their peoples to live meaningful lives and consolidate the democratization of their societies.  Many other countries in different parts of the world are also still mired in tragic conflict and look to the United Nations and its stronger Members for peacekeeping arrangements that can give time for those communities in strife to re-establish and find lasting solutions. Samoa  despite our small size  will continue to support that important work. At present we contribute police personnel for the United Nations Missions in the Sudan  Liberia  Timor-Leste and in the Solomon Islands.  Climate change issues remain a priority for the Pacific region. In our small islands  natural catastrophes are capable of destruction that devastates the entire country. They bring great pain and upheaval to the lives of our people  as well as set back the national economy for years. We know that from repeated past experience. The need  therefore  for good early-warning systems for natural disaster alerts in our Pacific region is a priority. The willingness of our partners to assist and share expertise in that area is most welcomed.  The Global Environment Facility Trust Fund — recently replenished for the fourth time — demonstrates very well the joint partnership between the developed and the developing countries in implementing programmes to address environmental problems.  Samoa continues to strongly support international and regional efforts to combat global warming and environmental degradation. In our view  the evidence of global warming and its causes are well established. Apportioning blame and point scoring should no longer be allowed to deflect efforts at effective and collective responses. We now know that concerted action should   17 06-53005  have been taken much earlier and further delays would simply make the size of the problem greater and the solutions more costly.  Good progress has been achieved in the efforts to reform our Organization. I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his inspirational work in balancing the interests of Member States  which did not always coincide  and for his influence that made it possible for agreement to be reached on the reform agenda. I thank the Secretary-General for his courage and leadership  so that even in the face of great controversy  the United Nations remained relevant to the crises and challenges that our world and the Organization has faced during his watch."
"189",7522,"YEM",61,2006,"At the outset  I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session on her election. It is a source of pride for us that an Arab woman from brotherly Bahrain is presiding over the session. I would also like to thank Mr. Jan Eliasson  President of the Assembly at its sixtieth session  for his valuable and tireless efforts in the conduct of our work and for the positive results he has achieved for our Organization  particularly with regard to United Nations reform. I would also like to warmly welcome   51 06-52885  the Republic of Montenegro as the 192nd Member of our international family.  I am pleased that this meeting coincides with a new democratic achievement in my country  Yemen. Today  20 September  the second direct presidential election and elections for local councils have taken place competitively in a free and fair atmosphere. This democratic exercise demonstrates the maturity of the people of Yemen and reflects our country’s commitment to democracy as a peaceful means of sharing power and popular participation in development and economic and social reform.  The recent developments in Lebanon and Palestine include the destruction of Lebanon’s infrastructure owing to aggression by the Israeli war machine — which has caused the deaths of countless innocent civilians  mainly women  children and the elderly — threats to murder or assassinate the leadership of Lebanon and Palestine  extrajudicial and other practices. These all run counter to the United Nations Charter  the rules of international law and international agreements  including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Fourth Geneva Convention. The massacres committed by the Israeli war machine against Lebanese and Palestinian  civilians — particularly the Qana II massacre  whose victims were mostly children under the age of 12 and which was witnessed by the entire world — have evoked feelings of denunciation and condemnation by all people. This requires a firmer stance in the face of Israeli policies based on violence and State terrorism.  It is even more regrettable that the United Nations stands by and watches helplessly while the Lebanese people are subjected to devastation and destruction caused by Israeli aggression over 34 days. We would like to reiterate that the implementation of Security Council 1701 (2006) should not undermine the territorial integrity of Lebanon and should not lead to sectarian divisions among the people of that country. It should also mandate that Israel compensate Lebanon for all the destruction.  Israeli practices  such as assassinations of Palestinian individuals  detention of the President of the Palestinian Parliament  the Deputy Prime Minister or other Ministers  are a perfect example of Israel’s total disregard for international law  human rights  or agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority. This makes it incumbent upon the Security Council to firmly deal with such Israeli aggression  to demand the release of all Palestinian leaders under detention and in Israeli prisons  and to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict neutrally and responsibly. It is only thus that the Middle East can enjoy stability and Israel can enjoy security.  In order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace  Arab countries have requested that the Security Council consider the Arab-Israeli conflict file responsibly and fairly in order to put an end to the conflict and to spare the region further wars and conflicts. If the Security Council fails to do that  then it will bear the responsibility for continuing the conflict in the region  with the attendant suffering and dire consequences for all parties concerned.  From this rostrum  we call upon the international community to stand beside the elected Iraqi Government  to help it spread its authority over its territory  to put an end to violence and interference by external parties in the internal affairs of Iraq  to respect the territorial integrity of Iraq and to put an end to its occupation.  With regard to the Sudan  we reiterate our support for the efforts by the Sudanese Government to bring peace to Darfur  in accordance with the security plan presented to the Security Council. The decision to extend the mandate of the African Union forces until the end of December of this year is welcome. Provision of adequate logistics and increasing the number of these peacekeeping forces will enable them to play their role. The dispatch of any international forces without the agreement of the Government of the Sudan constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter.  With regard to Somalia  Yemen would like to commend the Arab-African efforts for conciliation between the Transitional Somali Government and the Union of Islamic Shariah Courts  and the outcome of the talks held at Khartoum under the sponsorship of the League of Arab States from 1 to 5 September. We call upon all international parties to provide support to the Somali Government so as to enable it to reconstruct the country and re-establish State institutions. Yemen has always been a partner in the conciliation process and supports all efforts by all parties. Yemen emphasizes that any external interference in Somalia’s affairs could lead to violence and confrontation in the Horn of Africa.    06-52885 52   Yemen underlines the right of all countries to possess nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We have reiterated our commitment to the General Assembly declaration to make the Middle East a region free of all weapons of mass destruction  including nuclear weapons  and to compel Israel to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in order to guarantee stability in the region and to avoid a nuclear race.  Given our concern for the promotion of trust among all countries seeking to develop their nuclear energy for peaceful purposes  we call upon all to cooperate in the creation of a joint entity for nuclear research for peaceful purposes  in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Yemen has reiterated its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We believe that this phenomenon  which is alien to our societies and to the religion of Islam  can be attributed to many factors  including a feeling of lack of international justice  the spread of misleading judgements and decrees  and misconceptions of others based on race or religion. Such factors have undermined trust among people and have led to the spread of extremism and terrorism.   An international conference should be convened to reach an agreement on an accurate definition of terrorism and to deal with its root causes  such as poverty  unemployment  lack of education and the absence of international justice. A distinction should also be made between terror against innocent civilians and the legitimate right of people to resist foreign occupation.  The Republic of Yemen would like to reiterate its commitment to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted in 2000 and to the Monterrey Consensus. We are convinced that the mobilization of financial resources for development and their effective use in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition are essential for the realization of a genuine global partnership for development.  We would like to stress here the need to grant developing countries greater freedom in the development and management of their development programmes  in accordance with their national priorities and their special situations  in conformity with international strategies for development.  Based on our belief that the individual should be the focus of development and its ultimate objective  we have given utmost priority to the MDGs and have mainstreamed them in our policies and five-year development plan  2006-2010  as well as integrated them into the economic  environmental and social aspects of our plans.  We have thus adopted a series of measures and actions for reform in the financial  administrative and judicial fields  the most recent of which is the total separation of the judiciary power from the executive power and the appointment of an independent chief judge of the country’s judicial authority. We have also involved civil society organizations  which are key partners in economic and political development and progress  and have cooperated with donor countries  specialized agencies and international organizations in the implementation of our second five-year plan for the alleviation of poverty. That plan is based on small projects and on the expansion of technical education  the provision of basic services  the promotion of good governance and the fight against corruption. It is an ambitious plan that we believe requires international support in order to achieve its objective and result in a qualitative leap in human development in Yemen.  At the beginning of the twenty-first century  we must review the system of international relations to base it more on trust  dialogue and cooperation. We all are in agreement that democracy and the enjoyment of freedoms are at the core of desired reform  and here I should like to stress that the reform of national and of international policies are two sides of the same coin.  Democracy in international relations helps to promote democracy in national policies and is a genuine motive for it. That requires that the United Nations itself be an example to follow in terms of the exercise of democracy. Thus reform and restructuring of the United Nations is required  as well as its revitalization and the restoration of its international standing and prestige  including through the expansion of the membership of the Security Council to include representation by all continents. That should be done in an equitable manner that guarantees representation by all cultures and civilizations and also assigns a more prominent role to the Economic and Social Council in elaborating international policies relating to economic and social issues and in the follow-up of their implementation. It should be done also in a manner that promotes international efforts to move   53 06-52885  development forward and assist developing countries to realize the MDGs.  In conclusion  and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Yemen  I should like to extend our thanks and deep appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his tireless and dedicated efforts in the conduct of the Organization during his two terms of office  working  patiently and diligently  in the service of humanity. I would like to wish him every success in his future endeavours. "
"190",7560,"YUG",61,2006,"First  I sincerely thank Mr. Kofi Annan  the Secretary-General  for all the efforts he has made throughout his very successful mandate during a time of enormous challenges facing our civilization. I particularly single out his exceptional understanding of the problems that south-eastern Europe has faced and is still facing.  I also congratulate you  Madam President  on your election.  At the same time  I warmly welcome the accession of Montenegro to the United Nations as a new Member State.  I am addressing the General Assembly today as President of the Republic of Serbia  an independent and democratic State in south-eastern Europe  in the Balkans. I assure the Assembly that Serbia seeks to make a significant contribution to this part of the world — in terms of fast democratization and respect for human rights  economic development  the security of the entire Balkans and the stability of south-eastern Europe. Instead of being a place where problems are created  Serbia and the Balkans must become a place where problems are resolved in a peaceful manner.    06-52988 4   Serbia is simultaneously a new and an old State — new  because its flag is flying for the first time in front of this building  and old  because already in 1835 its Constitution guaranteed freedom to any man setting foot on its soil; new  because it is being created against the backdrop of the specific challenges of the twenty-first century  and old  because it is created in accordance with the very principles it helped to establish and embody in the Charter of the United Nations in 1945.  Today Serbia is an active Member of the United Nations. We believe that the decisions made under the Organization’s auspices have to form the basis of stability and prosperity for all States and peoples in south-eastern Europe.  Serbia believes in a shared and prosperous future for the Balkans. It is important to stress that none of the current problems in the Balkans can be viewed or resolved in isolation  without taking into account our common history and a vision of our shared future. Hence  in dealing with any problem in the Balkans  it is necessary to hear and give weight to the opinions of all countries in the region.  I trust that a better future for our part of the world will be based upon three major principles: democracy  as a guarantor of human freedom and the basis of economic progress; the security of each State  as a precondition for the security of the entire Balkans; and regional stability  as a vital factor of global peace and prosperity. All the challenges we face should be tackled in accordance with those principles.   In that spirit  Serbia is sincerely committed to the territorial integrity of all Balkan States and the preservation of their existing borders. In the same vein  the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina  based on the Dayton Accords  which may be changed by its citizens only with the consensus of all three constituent peoples  is an essential factor in the stability and further democratization of the region. By the same token  the preservation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia is in the interest of democracy and the prosperity of all of south-eastern Europe.  Strengthening regional cooperation is Serbia’s priority. That is why we believe that the prosperity of all neighbouring countries is in the interest of Serbia. We are aware that the Balkan countries can make progress and achieve their primary foreign policy objective — European Union and Euro-Atlantic membership — only through cooperation.   In this regional framework  we also wish to actively cooperate in the fight against organized crime  corruption and international terrorism. As a concrete contribution to this goal  at my initiative  a meeting of the Heads of State of south-eastern Europe will soon be held in Belgrade  aimed at promoting communication and strengthening cooperation in the fight against these threats to the life and prosperity of us all.  Serbia sees the Balkans as a common space  in which it is possible to achieve political and social stability. The achievement of that goal should be an important contribution to efforts conducive to full democratization and peace. It is based on the principle of shared responsibility of all Balkan States. That is why none of the Balkan States must feel a loser as we move closer to a joint European future.  Kosovo and Metohija is currently under United Nations interim administration. The settlement of Kosovo’s future status is one of the most difficult problems facing Serbia  the other Balkan countries and the international community  as well as the Albanian and Serbian people in Kosovo. That is why we believe that this problem should be addressed in a strategic and substantive manner in order to arrive at a solution that will take into account the full complexity of relations in the Balkans. That poses certain requirements: to face the past  to find sustainable solutions for the present and to open up avenues of cooperation in the future.  But  of course  this does not imply that the Kosovo case is unique  different from all others. On the contrary  the Kosovo problem must be approached on the basis of recognized principles of international law and universal democratic values. If there is failure in that  we shall not be able to escape the vicious circle of old animosities and mutual recriminations.  What it seeks for itself  Serbia seeks for the province  too: promotion of democracy  respect for human rights  economic prosperity and security. In order to contribute to that goal  Serbia has decided to ensure power supply this winter from its own resources to Kosovo’s population.  It is in the interest of Serbia that Kosovo be stable  prosperous  economically viable  multi-ethnic and democratic. Before its future status is determined  it is of crucial importance to establish the rule of law   5 06-52988  and put an end to seven years of discrimination against the Serbs as well as other non-Albanian communities  who suffer as the target of extremism and terrorism.  The autonomy offered by Serbia to Kosovo Albanians is broader than any currently enjoyed by any region or federal unit in Europe. In our view  that is a sustainable  stable and long-standing solution that would open a new chapter in the long and difficult history of Serbian-Albanian relations. Among other things  it would enable Kosovo to have direct access to international financial institutions  necessary for its economic recovery and development  which are in the interest of both Serbia and the region as a whole.  Serbia is genuinely committed to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals  technological advancement and economic prosperity. Large-scale poverty  which unfortunately still prevails  deeply affects human dignity.  Today  21 September  we observe the International Day of Peace. It is important that it be observed each year in an effort to put an end to wars and violence in the world. Many crises have not yet been resolved  and some continue to escalate dangerously  while new challenges threaten to generate new conflicts  destruction and humanitarian catastrophes.  An important aspect of preserving peace and security is efficient and timely deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces. Serbia supports the efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of United Nations peacekeeping  and my country is ready to make an active contribution to these operations. The mandate of peacekeeping operations is today more diverse than it used to be and includes conflict-prevention  peacekeeping  post-conflict reconstruction and assistance to long-term and sustainable development.  Following several years of conflict  the Balkans is slowly but surely turning into a zone of good-neighbourliness and cooperation. Serbia is prepared to deal with the burden of its recent past in the interest of its Balkan and European future. The people of Serbia started doing this successfully and democratically in 2000  when they removed the regime largely responsible for the hardships that befell Serbia and the Balkans in the last decade of the twentieth century.  Precisely for that reason  we are firmly committed to the successful completion of our cooperation with the Hague Tribunal. This is not merely our international obligation; it is also a question of moral values.  As a responsible State and a part of the international community  Serbia is truly devoted to honouring the Charter of the United Nations and building democracy in the world. Therefore  Serbia is firmly committed to making its full contribution to the strengthening of the role and mandate of the United Nations  as well as to multilateral dialogue leading to equal cooperation among States and peoples  to respect for human rights and freedoms  and to tolerance and mutual respect. "
"191",7588,"ZAF",61,2006,"Once again  we have convened at this seat of the Organization of the peoples of the world  representing the whole of humanity and coming from all corners of the world. Our pilgrimage this year is tinged with sadness  because we are also paying    06-52731 12  homage to one of the most outstanding servants of the United Nations  a native son of Africa  Kofi Annan  whose term of office will soon come to an end.  The Group of 77 and China  as well as my own country  South Africa  sincerely thanks the Secretary-General for the selfless and dedicated work he carried out during one of the most challenging periods in the history of this Organization. In the midst of increasing poverty and underdevelopment during an era of unprecedented wealth accumulation and technological advances  and as the river that divides the rich and the poor zones of the metaphorical global village ever widened  the Secretary-General never lost focus on the imperatives of our time.  We thank him for never losing sight of the fact that poverty and underdevelopment remain the biggest threats to the progress that has been achieved  and that equality among nations big and small is central to the survival  relevance and credibility of this global Organization.  We are only six years into the twenty-first century. Those who populate the poorest of the regions of the world — that is  Africa — have boldly declared that it will be an African century. It is a century that billions of citizens of the developing world and other poor and marginalized people want to transform into a century for all humanity.  If the wishes of the majority of the world could turn into reality  this would be a century free of wars  free of internecine conflicts  free of hunger  free of preventable disease  free of want  free of environmental degradation and free of greed and corruption. Indeed  we began the century with great hopes for a better  peaceful and more humane world.  Together  we crafted comprehensive plans and bold declarations to defeat the scourge of poverty and underdevelopment. Together  we committed ourselves  with what seemed like renewed vigour  to transform the United Nations to reflect the modern reality that is defined by free  sovereign and equal nations.  However  six years into the twenty-first century  dispassionate observers might well challenge us to achieve our noble and lofty objectives  pointing to the terrorists’ acts that welcomed us into the new century. They might emphasize the unilateralism that threatens to negate the democratic advances of the last decades of the twentieth century and draw attention to renewed conflicts and wars that seem to compete with the destructive fury of the conflicts of the last century.  They would remind us that for a decade and more  some of the developed nations have consistently refused to implement the outcomes and agreements of this world body that would help to alleviate the wretchedness of the poor. Thus  Madam President  when you correctly urge us to implement a global partnership for development  we  the members of the Group of 77 and China  who represent the poor people of the world  understand you to be communicating a message that we should give substance to the common commitments we solemnly made at this supreme Organization of the nations of the world.  Yet  this common commitment for a global partnership for development cannot be transformed into reality when the rich and powerful insist on an unequal relationship with the poor. A global partnership for development is impossible in the absence of a pact of mutual responsibility between the giver and the recipient. It is impossible when the rich unilaterally demand the right to set the agenda and conditions for the implementation of commonly agreed programmes.  We who represent the poor know as a matter of fact that these billions of poor people are increasingly becoming impatient  because every year they hear us adopt declaration after declaration and yet nothing practical is done to assuage the hunger pains that keep them awake at night. Only few and selected agreements are implemented  with outcomes that are clearly insufficient to alleviate the excruciating pain of their children who cannot cry anymore because to do so is to invite more pain.  Those of us who were at the 14th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana heard this message very clearly emanating from all the countries and organizations that spoke. Those who are capable of listening should take note of what that great son of India and South Africa  Mahatma Gandhi  said on this matter:  “The test of friendship is assistance in adversity  and that too  unconditional assistance. Cooperation which needs consideration is a commercial contract and not friendship. Conditional cooperation is like adulterated cement which does not bind.”   13 06-52731   Precisely because of the absence of a global partnership for development  the Doha Development Round has almost collapsed. Indeed  because the rich implicitly invoked the slogan of an over-confident European political party of the 1960s  and directed this uncaring declaration to the poor of today — “I’m alright  Jack!” — we have not implemented the Monterrey Consensus on Financing for Development  thus making it difficult for the majority of the developing countries  especially those in Africa  to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)  and we have reduced the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation to an insignificant  and perhaps forgotten  piece of paper.  Part of the problem with this unequal relationship is the imposition of conditions on developing countries and the constant shifting of the goalposts  whenever the poor adhere to each and every one of those conditions.  Among other things  we have recently seen an outbreak of great social instability across Europe and other reactions of the poor to their miserable conditions in different parts of the world  which calls into question the image of a seemingly harmonious well-woven tapestry of diverse groups  because we continue to fail to implement our own decisions as taken at the United Nations World Conference against Racism  Racial Discrimination  Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. Those who coined the slogan: “I’m alright  Jack!” were communicating  whether consciously or not  a message and an attitude that said “I don’t care about my neighbour as long as my family and I eat well and sleep peacefully” and that “It is not my responsibility to ensure that my poor neighbour also eats well and sleeps peacefully.”  Today  the attitude among some of the rich also communicates the same message to the rest of the world  namely  “I’m alright  Jack!”  even when they are acutely aware that many in their neighbourhood are dying from hunger  preventable diseases and abject poverty.  This happens also in the cruelly ironic situation where resources flow from those who have little to those who have plenty. Although the rich and powerful know the miserable life circumstances of the poor and have solemnly committed themselves to the collective effort to reverse those conditions  their attitude and response resembles that of the Biblical Cain  who  after he killed his brother  Abel  and the Lord asked him “Where is Abel  your brother?”  replied: “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”  Perhaps  all of us  especially the rich  should heed the words of one of the great sons of the United States of America  who perished because of his belief in equality and justice for all human beings and whose civil rights movement is currently marking its golden jubilee. Martin Luther King Jr. warned that  “As long as there is poverty in the world I can never be rich  even if I have a billion dollars. As long as diseases are rampant and millions of people in this world cannot expect to live more than 28 or 30 years  I can never be totally healthy even if I just got a good check-up at the Mayo Clinic. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the way our world is made. No individual or nation can stand out boasting of being independent. We are interdependent.”  The majority of the human race is entitled to ask the question whether the rich respond the way they do because further impoverishment of the poor is to the advantage of the rich  giving meaning to the old observation that the rich get richer as the poor get poorer. As the divide between the rich and the poor widens and becomes a serious global crisis  we see an increase in the concentration of economic  military  technological  media and other power.  Something is seriously wrong when people risk life and limb travelling in suffocating containers to Western Europe in search of a better life. Something is wrong when many Africans traverse  on foot  the harsh  hot and hostile Sahara Desert to reach European shores. Something is wrong when walls are built to prevent poor neighbours from entering those countries where they seek better opportunities. Something is indeed wrong when all these people  whose fault is merely the fact that their lives are defined by poverty  try desperately to reach countries where they believe the conditions of their existence could improve  only to meet hostile  and at times  barbaric and inhuman receptions.  In part  the United Nations is unable to fulfil some of the objectives set by the founders in San Francisco because  in truth  it does not reflect the expansion of the global family of free nations. Because this Organization of the peoples of the world has grown to encompass the entire world  many had    06-52731 14  thought that it would be logical that this custodian of global democracy would itself serve as a beacon in our continuing quest for democracy in all our countries.  Clearly  for the United Nations to continue occupying its moral high ground  it has to reform itself urgently and lead by practical example  showing what it means to be democratic. Even as we face the cold reality of the indifference of many among the rich and powerful  this Organization of the peoples of the world has continued to offer hope and the possibility of the fulfilment of the aspirations of the majority of the peoples of the world.  All of us  including those who hesitate to implement the commonly agreed positions  agree that this Organization has entrenched the correct understanding that development is a right and is central to the advancement of humanity. All of us  individually and collectively and as Members of the United Nations  must do whatever is necessary to develop and implement policies and strategies aimed at the achievement of sustainable development. It is important that international organizations such as the Bretton Woods institutions  the World Trade Organization (WTO) and others should  without any equivocation  seriously embark on the implementation of all the commitments that we have made as the international community.  This Organization of the peoples of the world cannot merely note the unacceptable situation that Africa will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. We need further programmes  focused and concrete  to accelerate development in Africa and avoid the possibility of that continent sinking further into the morass of poverty and underdevelopment.  Because we are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers  we have the responsibility to end the rhetoric and implement programmes that ensure that all human beings live decent  humane and prosperous lives.  On behalf of the Group of 77 and China  as well as my own country  South Africa  I take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson  for the great work he did in steering this Organization during this past year as President of the General Assembly.  We are honoured to welcome Her Excellency Sheikha Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  and we wish her well in her important work. Madam President  we pledge to do whatever is necessary to make your work easier  so that through your efforts  the poor can regain full confidence in the ability of the United Nations to improve their conditions of life.  Every day the masses cry out in pain  frustration and anger. Every day they ask whether there is anybody who stops to hear their voices  anybody who listens and who is ready to respond to their heartfelt plea for the restoration of their dignity. "
"192",7630,"ZMB",61,2006,"On behalf of the Zambian delegation  I congratulate you  Madam President  on your election as President of the sixty-first session of the United Nations General Assembly. It is indeed significant to have a lady holding the highest office of the General Assembly after almost three decades. To us  this attests to the commitment of the United Nations to the principle of gender equality.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome a new member to the United Nations  the Republic of Montenegro.  Madam President  I wish to pay tribute to your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  the Foreign Minister of Sweden  who successfully presided over the sixtieth session. He rendered selfless commitment and devotion to the search for consensus on a number of issues  including the 2005 World Summit Outcome. It is pleasing to note that during his presidency  a number of decisions were taken  including the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights Council.  Allow me to also pay fitting tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General of the United Nations  Mr. Kofi Annan  for the outstanding leadership he has provided to our Organization  particularly in his efforts to reform it into a more vibrant and accountable body. His vision and stewardship of the Organization has set the United Nations on a new course. We wish him well in his future endeavours as he leaves office. It is now up to us Member States to summon sufficient will to make his vision a reality.  The world today is faced with challenges of extreme poverty and underdevelopment  conflicts among and between nations and terrorism  which have   37 06-53341  given rise to increased insecurity all over the world. In addition  human trafficking is on the increase worldwide. Often  innocent women and children in search of a better life  are sold and made to engage in illicit activities. That is a gross violation of human rights  which must be seriously addressed by the international community.  The 2005 Summit Outcome set a global agenda to address those challenges. Much has been achieved  but more remains to be done if we are to build a world body that is effective and relevant to the challenges faced. Indeed  as Mr. Kofi Annan has indicated in his “In Larger Freedom” report   “we will not enjoy development without security  we will not enjoy security without development  and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.” (A/59/2005  para. 17)  The guiding principles of the United Nations Charter incorporate the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We believe that without the protection of those rights and freedoms  meaningful development cannot be achieved.  As one of the 47 Member States elected to the newly established Human Rights Council  Zambia is committed to upholding the tenets of human rights in our country and the world at large. In that regard  Zambia commends the United Nations for establishing the Human Rights Council  and as a pioneer member  pledges to give it all the support that it will require. We commit ourselves to assist in formulating rules and structures designed to ensure a strong Council that is transparent  non-selective and non-politicized and that promotes dialogue and cooperation among Member States.  I am pleased to state that Zambia has made progress in consolidating human rights and good governance. Zambia has further strengthened the rule of law and upheld the highest standards of individual freedoms for all citizens  without discrimination based on sex  colour  race or religious affiliation. In that regard  we appeal to the international community to assist us to strengthen and build the capacities of human rights institutions and all related institutions that have an important role to play in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Permit me at this juncture to thank the international community for electing Zambia to the Human Rights Council  with the second highest number of votes.  With regard to increased global insecurity  Zambia reaffirms that a new vision of collective security is required. Member States of the United Nations expect the collective mechanism to address threats  such as war  weapons of mass destruction  terrorism  organized crime and civil conflict  infectious diseases  extreme poverty and environmental degradation. If the United Nations is to strengthen the operations of that collective mechanism  Member States must work through the United Nations Security Council and other United Nations agencies to develop stronger anti-terrorism  nuclear non-proliferation  disarmament and crime prevention regimes.  Zambia will continue to actively pursue measures intended to curtail terrorism through various actions  including taking appropriate national legislative reforms. To that end  we welcome the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and look forward to the adoption of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism.  Our Organization cannot afford to avoid addressing situations that threaten international peace and security  such as the recent case of Lebanon. Pitifully  we witnessed a case of the inaction of the Security Council  a body charged with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. That state of affairs only reaffirms the need to reform the Security Council  with regard to its working methods and the enlargement of its membership. In that regard  Zambia reaffirms Africa’s well-known position on the matter.  At this stage  I would be remiss if I did not mention the Great Lakes region  which is emerging from a protracted period of conflict  followed by a period of successful transition towards democracy. The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region will hold its second summit in Nairobi in December 2006  to adopt the draft pact on security  stability and development in the region. In that regard  we need the continued political and financial support of the international community to ensure its adoption.  It is important to confirm that the peacebuilding and development process in the Great Lakes region has    06-53341 38  reached a very advanced stage at all the three-dimensional levels  namely: international partnership  regional ownership and national stewardship. The vision for integrated and sustainable human development in the Great Lakes region is now reassured. The cessation of conflicts in the region  has already fed into the collective will to transform the subregion into a place of sustainable peace  political security and development.  Extreme poverty and deprivation breed disease. The number of people living with or affected by HIV/AIDS and the deaths caused by AIDS have continued to grow in the world today. Furthermore  between 350 and 500 million people per year are exposed to malaria  which is estimated to be the number one cause of mortality in most developing countries.  Zambia  like many of the developing countries adversely affected by those diseases  supports all the efforts made by the international community in combating HIV/AIDS  malaria and tuberculosis. We therefore welcome the creation of an international drug purchase facility to combat HIV/AIDS  tuberculosis and malaria. This will not only facilitate easy access to medicine but will also lower the costs and therefore benefit many countries  especially in the developing world.  Poverty in the world today accounts for many of the social and economic injustices that people are subjected to in many developing countries. Four years ago  a bargain was struck in Monterrey between developed and developing countries on the implementation of a comprehensive strategy bold enough to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Developed countries were urged to support those efforts with action on aid  trade and debt relief.  While we commend the developed countries for taking tangible steps to fulfil their commitments  we call upon them to do so as a matter of urgency. It is saddening to note that six years after the Millennium Declaration was signed  the majority of our people in Africa are still exposed to abject poverty and live on less than $1 per day. Although there has been significant progress in achieving the MDGs  much more remains to be done in order to reverse the negative trends of poverty and the continued marginalization of people across the world.  We call for the removal of the unjust multilateral trade system  which continues to hamper the fair participation of the developing and least developed countries in the global market. We would like to draw the attention of the Assembly to the role of our developing partners  particularly  in the quick and concrete implementation of the Doha Development Agenda. It should be pointed out that with fair trading practices  developing and least developed countries would take a significant step towards self-sustenance and reduce dependence on aid.  Furthermore  we welcome the outcome of the Gleneagles Summit  at which the leaders of the Group of Eight pledged to increase aid to Africa by $25 billion a year by 2010. We also express our gratitude to those leaders for extending and deepening debt relief to the poorest countries through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. That Initiative has resulted in 100-per-cent cancellation of the debt owed to the international multilateral financial institutions by the poor countries that have reached the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative. Zambia is one such country. In addition  our gratitude goes to the other cooperating partners for agreeing to expand aid to developing countries by approximately $50 billion. Those resources will indeed contribute to the advancement of the MDGs.  Although in the recent past we have seen an increase in the commitment of aid resources and action and a reaffirmation of the principle of mutual accountability  there is still an urgent need to ensure that aid is managed efficiently and used effectively for the achievement of the MDGs. It is equally important to closely monitor the donor commitments and aid flows targeted at achieving the MDGs that we have set for ourselves to improve the lives of the poor and most vulnerable in the global community. The people in the developing countries have been listening attentively to the promises that we have made in various international forums. They continue to monitor those commitments. Their expectations and aspirations are very high. It is therefore incumbent on us to ensure that those commitments and promises are fulfilled.  The twenty-first century has been declared the century for the development of Africa. Let us therefore show true commitment to that cause. In a world where there is no true partnership between the rich nations and the poor nations  there can be no global security  no universal justice  no human rights and no   39 06-53341  meaningful development. More than ever before  all of us — rich and poor nations alike — have to work together to create a sense of equal partnership. We all need to fulfil our commitments within a given time frame and enter into new ones in order to reach our   goal of a world free of hunger  extreme poverty and disease — indeed  a world where we can live in a secure  clean and sustainable environment. "
"193",7666,"ZWE",61,2006,"Let me begin my statement by echoing the sentiments of those who have congratulated you  Madam on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-first session  as well as of those who have expressed their appreciation for the manner in which your predecessor  Mr. Jan Eliasson  successfully conducted the business of the sixtieth session. In the same vein  I should also like to congratulate the Republic of Montenegro on its admission to the United Nations family.  I also wish to pay special tribute to the Secretary-General  Mr. Kofi Annan  for his vision and exemplary leadership of the United Nations over the past 10 years. We commend him for his tireless efforts to assist Member States in transforming the United Nations into a dynamic  relevant and effective instrument for meeting challenges that confront us as we try to make the world a better place for everyone.  The achievements of the Secretary-General  especially in the area of the promotion of peace and development — notable among them the Millennium Summit in 2000 and the review Summit held last year — will always be remembered as historic because of the important decisions that we made on both occasions. As he nears the end of his tenure of his high Office  we wish him the best in his future endeavours and hope that he will be available to serve the international community wherever he may be needed.  The theme for our debate this year — implementation of the global partnership for development as a follow-up to the 2005 World Summit — is very appropriate. We acknowledged last year that fighting poverty was a collective undertaking. Together  we recognized that mobilizing financial resources for development is central to a global partnership for development in support of the implementation of internationally agreed goals  including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  For many years now  the international community has acknowledged the need for accelerated economic development in Africa. There have been many initiatives and programmes of action aimed at achieving that objective. Indeed  the history of the United Nations in the past three decades is littered with well-meaning initiatives  many of which unfortunately never made the transition from theory to practical implementation.  We have agreed on goals and set targets for ourselves in our quest to meet our economic and social development challenges. Given this impressive array of initiatives  it is curious and ironic that the aggregate economic performance of our countries has not made a difference in the lives of the majority of our people.  Mr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon)  Vice-President  took the Chair.  One explanation for our development predicament and the many failed initiatives is the wide gap between rhetoric and concrete action on the ground. We have on many occasions agreed on making available the means of implementing agreed goals. We have set targets for making those resources available. Yet  at the same time  we have witnessed some countries and groups taking concerted action  such as illegal economic sanctions  to frustrate our development efforts.  In the case of Zimbabwe  those countries have blocked balance of payments support and other types of assistance from the international financial institutions that they control. Following the heroic and successful efforts of the people of Zimbabwe to clear requisite arrears to the International Monetary Fund  those negative forces have manipulated decision-making at that institution so as to deny us any new support. They have even tried to restrict investment inflows  all on account of political differences between them and us.   Is it not a paradox that  while we are denied resources for development  funding is readily made available to support elements bent on subverting the democratically expressed will of the majority of our citizens and to unconstitutionally effect regime change? We condemn such interference in our domestic   9 06-52885  affairs. Let me repeat what I have said before: regime change in Zimbabwe — as  indeed  in any other country — is a right of the people of that country; it can never be a right of people of other countries. The golden key to regime change is in the hands of the people of Zimbabwe and is very well guarded. No one from Washington or London has the right to that key; it is our key and ours alone.  Let it also not be forgotten that those who want regime change are the very same people whom we fought yesterday. They represent British colonialism and imperialism. We spent many years in jail; I spent 11 years in jail. Then we went into exile in order to muster the military strength needed to overthrow colonialism. Many of our people died in the process. Many were killed by the British regime headed by Ian Smith. Finally  our people were victorious. On 18 April 1980  a representative of the royal family  Prince Charles  was sent to lower the British flag. I was there to hoist the flag of independence  which today represents the full sovereignty of the people of Zimbabwe  never again to be lost. Never again shall Zimbabwe become a colony.  And so  these manoeuvres and manipulations continue  and my Government is well aware of them and is well guarded. At every turn  we will take the steps necessary to protect our sovereignty  defend our people and defend our right to continue to ensure that that sovereignty reposes in the hands of the Zimbabwean people. From this rostrum  I want to warn that any attempt to change that mandate through unconstitutional means  by agents sent to undertake a process that we regard as illegal  will meet with the full wrath of the law.   It is for that reason that we welcome this debate  which seeks to address the yawning gap between agreed action plans and implementation  and between rhetoric and what actually happens on the ground. We fully acknowledge that national Governments shoulder the primary responsibility for implementing their development plans  including achieving the MDGs. However  it is absolutely necessary that our efforts at the national level — including adopting and implementing correct and relevant programmes — be supported  not hampered by a lack of international cooperation. This session  therefore  would be of great value if agreement were to be reached on financing for development  including the establishment of mechanisms to measure aid flows. Such financing  if it is to have a meaningful impact  should be adequate  predictable and consistent.  The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to cause untold havoc in Africa — particularly Southern Africa — owing to high levels of poverty  which make it difficult for the affected people to gain access to medication. Zimbabwe welcomes the continuing efforts by the international community of nations to find lasting solutions to the scourge of HIV/AIDS. We urge the donor community  in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies  to assist in scaling up access to affordable essential drugs  particularly for developing countries.  The tendency to use assistance in the fight against HIV/AIDS as a reward for political compliance and malleability is one that the United Nations should condemn. Given the fact that the pandemic does not respect borders  the denial of assistance to countries on political grounds  through a self-serving and selective approach  will do more harm and weaken international efforts to fight the pandemic. For example  in my country  a Zimbabwean AIDS patient receives  on average  approximately $4 per year in international assistance  compared with an average of approximately $172 per year for other countries in the region. However  even against that background  my Government has registered some modest success in reducing the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate from approximately 29 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 percent in 2006  on the strength of its own resources and programmes.  While we do not dispute the inevitability of migration  the problem of the brain drain is of great concern to my Government and  indeed  to other developing countries. The brain drain has proved to be a handicap to sustainable development. If it is not addressed now  the chances that developing countries will achieve the MDGs by 2015 are minimal. While developing countries are losing skilled manpower through migration  the benefits associated with migrant remittances are far less than the cost of developing human resources and skills. We need to develop solutions that give due recognition and respect to the investments made by Governments in human resources and in developing the skills of citizens  as well as to the human rights of migrants.  While official development assistance is desirable  what developing countries need more is an    06-52885 10  open  rules-based  predictable  non-discriminatory trading and financial system. If developing countries are to realize the full potential of international trade to enhance economic growth  it is essential that the main barriers to their exports be removed. In that regard  we are concerned that tariffs have remained high on goods — such as textiles and farm products — that are strategically important to developing economies. Much could be done with the right partnerships and with fair terms of trade. We share the view that the implementation of the development aspects of the Doha Work Programme will go a long way towards assisting developing countries to compete in this global village. It is therefore disturbing that there has been no progress in breaking the deadlock on the Doha Round of international trade negotiations. The failure of multilateral negotiations will give rise to bilateral arrangements that are inimical to fair trade. We cannot help but suspect that the breakdown was deliberately engineered in order to perpetuate the status quo that favours one group of countries at the expense of another.  The United Nations is uniquely placed to provide the framework for international cooperation. There is consensus that the United Nations should play a fundamental and central role in the promotion of international cooperation for development. In that regard  it is important that coherence and coordination be enhanced  as agreed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome. At the country level  the United Nations system should be effectively coordinated in order to support national efforts in poverty reduction and sustainable development.  While my Government applauds the United Nations continuing efforts to elaborate a convention on terrorism  we urge Member States to guard against a situation in which established international conventions are ignored and resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies on that issue are disregarded. In our attempt to deal with the scourge of terrorism  it is also necessary to address the underlying causes of that phenomenon. To demonstrate its commitment to fighting terrorism  the Parliament of Zimbabwe has come up with the Suppression of Foreign and International Terrorism Bill  which seeks to fight foreign and international terrorism  as well as mercenary activities.  The recent developments in the Middle East are a cause of great concern. We condemn the disproportionate use of force by Israel in Gaza and Lebanon and the detention of elected Palestinian members of Parliament and ministers. We firmly reject the collective punishment of the Palestinian and Lebanese people and the intrusion into their territories in violation of international law. We call upon the international community  particularly the Security Council and the Quartet  to make every effort to ensure that the brokered ceasefire continues to hold.  It is sad that the Security Council dithered and failed to take timely action to stop the massacres and wanton destruction of civilian infrastructure in Lebanon  all because of the misguided national interests of one super-Power. The status quo in the Council  where a few powerful countries hold the world to ransom  is no longer tenable. There is therefore a strong case here for addressing the core issue of the democratization of international governance. Africa remains the only continent that does not have a permanent seat with veto power in the Security Council. That situation is unacceptable. It needs to be corrected and corrected now. The position of the African Union on that issue is very clear. Africa demands two permanent seats  complete with veto power — if the veto power is to continue — plus two additional non-permanent seats. We will not compromise on this matter until our concerns are adequately addressed.   Those who take objection to that are perhaps States that would want to remain in the position in which they are considered to be superior to everyone else. There cannot be superiority under the Charter of the United Nations  which recognizes the equality of nations. We are all equal under that Charter  and that principle has got to be recognized  but it would appear that some countries that have amassed military power over time consider themselves to be superior to all the others because they have that muscle of power. But the muscle of power is not the consideration that we take into account in judging the worth of nations. The Charter of the United Nations has got to be taken into account  and who knows whether the Goliath of today may tomorrow not be the same. Anyway  every Goliath has his own David.  In many parts of Africa  the dawn of an unprecedented era of peace and tranquillity has allowed us to refocus our attention and resources towards economic development. There can be no better time than now for the international community to   11 06-52885  augment our own efforts to bring home to our people the peace dividend we have so patiently waited for. We therefore call on the international community to renew its solidarity with Africa through tangible support in the form of increased resources  decisive debt relief  as well as new and additional financial resources for investment and growth.  Let me conclude by reiterating the fact that the future of the international community is best served by an international order that is based on strengthening multilateralism and thereby destroying the present unipolar system. It is our conviction that only through a multilateral approach can we achieve peace and development. For us to successfully tackle the challenges that we face  there is a need for more than just pious expressions of solidarity. Together as global partners in development  we can guarantee a prosperous future for generations to come. Such a partnership should be based on the principle of the sovereign equality of nations and on mutual benefit. That is the path we should strive to follow. "
